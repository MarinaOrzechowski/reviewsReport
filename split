HOWEVER, I am not convinced ANY real people work there. Calling and trying to talk to a human is nearly impossible and extremely frustrating. If you ask for a human, it says no. Then after going a couple of rounds with the AI, it gives up and sends you to a representative, which is great, but be warned, the AI will be talking in your ear the ENTIRE time. Every few seconds it tries to get you to hang up with something like \"for more information on [insert topic here] press 1.\" I understand they're trying to improve efficiency and productivity or whatever, but seriously? Annoying your customers is not the way to go.","3":"Honestly, if you're looking for a bank to stand by your side, be understanding and care about you, your family or even hardship. Bank of America is NOT IT! When the pandemic (Covid-19) hit. Bank of America was there to only tell me, that this is a business (Erica Solution Supervisor) she went on to tell me that they have to protect themselves. I was hurt, blown away and lost for words. I have been a customer of Bank of America, for over 13 years. Also, to be advised that I would have to run my credit again, in order for them to assist me. I couldn't believe it! All I can say is, is that I'm disappointed in how I was treated! Loyalty means nothing to Bank of America, when times are hard. You are only a Valued Customer. When you're doing well, besides that, you mean nothing! Sad to say, however it's the truth.","4":"Customer service experience is time consuming and the antithesis of personalized service. Spent hours trying to get fees returned when mother was hospitalized and not able to keep up with her checking. So many other good banks to chose from that have personalized service and where your money will be secure.

Your already on high alert knowing somehow someone got ahold of your banking information, then to be asked for your info over and over again.  My last transfer to the Fraud dept connected me to a woman who before I could speak said she can't hear me.  Before I could get out a full sentence, she said I had the wrong number and when I started to speak again she said she can't hear me then hung up.  This is very unprofessional and unsettling after giving out my personal info.  I've called before and had mixed experiences with their phone help.","2445":"I have been a customer for many, many years and all I can say is that the customer service at the bank is terrible.  Today, the line to see the teller was getting long and I asked the manager to get some help and her response was that she had a client and was too busy to assist all the customers in line.  As time went on, the people in line started to complain more and more.  The manager came out of the office and was listening to the complaints as she was speaking with another representative and they laughed about the whole situation before she returned to her office.Because of the long line and the lack of consideration that the bank showed to its customers, two customers made decisions that were not favorable for the bank.  One customer left in a huff and the other customer who I was speaking to decided to withdraw more than 20k dollars and close his accounts.If this is what the bank in Sun City Center wished, then it received its wishes.I am seriously considering closing all my accounts with the bank because of its lack of customer service","1":"I opened this account online I don\u2019t need to go to the bank I get high cash withdrawal and easy access to the online bank I like this bank.

I called and explained the situation to them, they said it was a valid charge and they would not remove the late fee.  What HORRIBLE customer service.  I asked what the process was to close my account, the  customer rep informed me of what damage I could do to my credit score if I closed a credit card account with 30K worth of credit. Really?  I'm certain they could care less about my credit score.  This was just my back-up credit card to use in case someone doesn't accept our Discover card.

I replied to her I needed to ask a question she then responded how hard is it to fill out a slip, name, date and address. I continued to ask my question to the teller that was assisting  me but she continues to say\u201dtell him to move tell him to move\u201d so I responded Your not even helping me I don\u2019t understand what the problem is? As I open my mouth to ask him my question she interrupted me yet again so I angrily responded \u201ctell her to shut the f*** up\u201d she then told me to get out.

She told me that I needed to show her respect. The manager comes out because it\u2019s now a big commotion between us two.

I express to the manager to watch how her employee is acting this is the same behavior she gave me upon walking in. I asked for her employees name because I made a formal complaint with boa she refused to give it to me. The manager then told me we are both at fault because I used foul language. She also told me it\u2019s been a long day which I told her I understand it happens. But I never approached nor opened my mouth to ask that angry teller anything.

This started in Jan 2020 when I purchased a new vehicle and the previous loan was paid off and the auto loan account closed. Yet still $425.75 came out of my checking account every month, withdrawn by BOFA. They sent a refund check two weeks later each time, but I didn\u2019t want to deal with that forever so I contacted 5\/3 bank to put a stop payment on that and block it.

I went on their social media and left sent them a message direct private message stating close my account immediately, they responded with this is sensitive information. that was a didn't give me any contact info didn't give me what the next steps were just sensitive information. then I finally set up an appointment to go meet with one of their customer service people I don't know what they're called at the branch, I confirm to this meeting but never showed up and in my notes for them to get prepared for what I was coming in for said close my accounts immediately, they still did not close my account and kept calling me and calling me to try and setup a time to come in and meet them. finally received an email from the lady I was supposed to meet with and she was complaining about me not showing up I stated I have contact you guys several times to close my account you have not I'm now copying in the BBB cuz this is unacceptable practices. my account went negative once already waiting on your team to close it nothing ever happened so now I'm escalating it.

I began my mortgage process on 7-13-20. My specialist was Michelle Brown. She lead me to believe that all was well and we would proceed after the pre approval. During the process I had to send her the same documents multiple times. After paying for inspection and paying for the appraisal which came out to over a $1000.00. We approached the time to submit my commitment to my attorney. She than stated I needed we had issues with my student loan amount.  So after reaching out to my student loan department, they gave me the documentation to be able to proceed. My attorney than had to submit an extension during this time to allow extra time for Bank of America. At this time I reached out to Joseph Allend, Michelle Brown's supervisor. She had reached him before me and told him of my situation with my student loans. I tried to reach him multiple times via phone and email. Please keep in mind that I moved out of my apartment with my son and had everything placed for the new home.  On November 10th, the day before my commitment was due she told me that I would not be getting my commitment letter.  When my  realtor called her she stated that she had 40 other customers.  I am currently homeless and in disarray. I would never believe that such a large company would do this to anyone.","1925":"Little did I know they charged me over $120 for transferring a few dollars from my savings to my checking account. When I called customer service, I was told there is nothing they can do. I guess BOA is unaware there is a pandemic going on or really just don\u2019t give a damn.","2465":"I am warning everyone considering a relationship with BofA to run and run far away and find someone else to do banking with!  BofA bought my home mortgage loan in May 2020 from my previous lender and from day 1 it has been THE ABSOLUTE WORST experience EVER!  First thing they did was tell me that I owed money for my escrow and that if I paid on time my mortgage would only be $1421+ and not spread out over 12 months with the mortgage being $1455+!  I hadn't even been their customer for a month at that point!  I paid the escrow through a teller who didn't know how to apply the loan to ESCROW so that was an unfortunate hurdle to cross!  Since then I have been on the phone ONCE A MONTH and at times MORE than once with hold times of 2 hours or more only to find out I was speaking to the wrong dept!  They CLAIM to be able to see prior calls but APPARENTLY they don't bother to read them because they say they can't confirm what other representatives have told me!  They ASSURE me that everything is fine and taken care of or WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF because they have ESCALATED my concerns to their supervisor!  I have requested an email or some sort of correspondence be sent to me verifying that they have indeed taken care of it but I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANYTHING! Go figure, they can send out all the NEGATIVE correspondence but heaven forbid they send out anything of a positive nature!  In the meantime, I have been threatened with late fees because they can't seem to get their act together!  Last conversation of 4 days ago with yet ANOTHER mortgage rep was the last straw, I even said that I was going to refinance because I'm tired of the BS runaround and it didn't seem to faze him!  He also told me that a payment of $700 that was ALSO not applied correctly FROM JUNE 2020 was now corrected and applied to my mortgage and that he also escalated this to his manager so that it could be handled in one day rather than the 14 or 15 days it normally takes! I was lied to again because he told me that he or his manager would call me and let me know that it was taken care of but of course I am still waiting to hear something 4 days later!  In the meantime I am left to wonder whether I will be hit with a late fee because of their BS mistakes!  I feel sorry for anyone of the reps that work for such a poorly run company! I think they should all be ashamed of themselves for such shoddy UNPROFESSIONAL service!  Just waiting for my refi to go through so that I can finally say SAYONARA BofA! They owe me about 2 days worth of my salary for all of the time I have spent trying to get this resolved!","2464":"I would give it negative (-)5 stars . This bank shouldn't be existing.

Both of my two credit cards the bank closed have Zero balance, and always paid in full. Bank of America provided me the reason for closing my accounts due to \"Inactivity on the accounts\".

Finally got a representative but did not catch her name. Told her my situation and she transferred me to her supervisor, Loretta.

They won't let me send the document to them in any format, they keep saying I have to come in person.  There are no branches in this state! So now my mom can't get her Social Security checks.

All I wanted to do was stop my automatic draft but you have to talk to a \u201cspecialist\u201d in order to do so.

For them to fo this and not tell me why? Well needless to say I was not going to take this without an explanation! I wrote and called there corporate office until finally some one got back to me a lady named Devin Harris who told me that someone filed a 3000.00 claim on my account and claimed to be me! I told her that there's was no way I filed a claim. I explained to her that I applied for a loan and was approved. I have the emails and loan documents to prove it. She told me that I could go and open up another account because I may have been the victim of a scam. I had to get a new account number and everything. She saud my identity may have been compromised. I was devasted. Why didnt anyine call me from the Bank right away or tell me something when I called 6 times prior? I made a repoet to the FTC and FBI. Now Sun Credit Financial is harassing over 3000.00 they saying I defaulted on the loan. So now I dont know what to do. Then well my direct deposit from socially security goes to my old account thats supposed to be closed. I was suppos3s to wait for it to go back to socially security so they can send it back to me by mail but Bank of America kept it! They said it was part of the investigation!

Yesterday i tried to move funds over from account to account,and the mobile app stopped working....its funny how it stops working,when its time for them to get thier nsf fees. Im complaining cause its not rite how boa fixes thier system so it only works in thier favor.  Then when you call in and ask for a manager, they put you on the phone with another associate sittingin the next cubicle, thats how they did me today,11\/10\/20,Texas location, then again i dont know if it was Texas cause they lie so much about thier names and bs numbers. I know cause the lady i talked to today,used the same number as someone else that was a man,the last time i talked to someone, with the same number. The same thing happened to me last weekend thier app mysteriously stopped working.  A good smile and a nice hello is out dated,now a days,we need businesses to deliver, the product they are advertising. Boa is not doing this and this is why you are considered to be the worse bank in America.  Thanks boa in texas for nothing, im sure u wont send a survey to my email this time.

I knew more than both of the people i talked to today,i had more insight than they both had as well, its not good when the callers knows boa s job,better than they do.

No big deal. Just deposit it at the ATM right? Wrong. I deposit it, then after a little while the money suddenly disappears.

Anyways, call customer service and the lady tersely tells me that because the check had two names on it they couldn't cash it. Mind you she was totally rude and didn't offer any help or other information. That was two months ago - I mailed the copy of the check to my third party whose name was also on the check. He obviously had no idea what to do with it, and why would he? Anyways, I gave up on that endeavor and accepted that I wouldn't be getting my $1200 stimulus money. Just gone. But it gets better. On October 29 I saw my account go from 600ish to 0. Calling \"customer service\" I got a non answer of \"that's from your state\". Wha? Anyways, I did some research on Google and called again. This time I got a \"response\" about it's from this and this number. Apparently something about the CA Franchise Tax board. Now I know CA is a sleazy state that will happily take your money if it can, but in this case I don't blame CA, I blame BoA. This is clearly a fraudulent transaction from some shady third party. But BoA never gave me the option to dispute the transaction nor were they any help on the phone. I would call again but I'm sure I'll hit another brick wall.

Let alone I always call during the morning because I have things to do during the rest of my day, everytime I call Bank of America it ruins my plans for the rest of the day because of how long this damn hold is, like I have things to do and places to go! Nobody should ever have to wait 3-4 hours to receive information on their claim .

Basically in July I had some fraud problems that amounted in $3000 being taken from my account, I dealt with it then and it was resolved, but now in October, it was suddenly taken back out of my account claiming that it wasn't fraud. After 4 hours on the phone, they promised that I would get that money back, but two weeks later nothing happened, now I have to spend more and more time on hold listening to the same god dang song for 6 hours. I need to pay my rent, and allowing a customer to lose $3000 and lie to them about it coming back is inexcusable.EDIT: Also in many of my attempts to call them, they end the phone call on their end while I'm still on hold after waiting for over an hour and a half.UPDATE: They still haven't given me my money back, these people don't care about their customers. I have been trying to call them EVERY day, and they end my call before I can get in contact with anyone after wasting 3+ hours of my time waiting. I have other stuff to do in my day and having to waste my time on hold with a bank that promised to fix a problem weeks ago and still hasn't is just awful customer service. The second I get this money(assuming they ever actually let me speak to anyone), I am taking it somewhere else.UPDATE 2: After waiting for FOUR HOURS on the phone, I got a hold of someone, heard their voice for two seconds and then was hung up on after getting an automated message stating \"this inbox is full.\" Glad to find out I just wasted most of my day on a phone call that amounted to nothing, really cool.

I immediately reported it as fraud- I was asleep, it was charged at a grocery store I've been to maybe twice in the last six months. They declined my case TWICE, they couldn't even tell me which location the grocery store was (so I couldn't get more information to prove I didn't make the charge) and never refunded me the money. For context..I've had an account with them for TEN YEARS and I've never had to call them to give the stolen money back. The one time I did, they disappointed me big time.

Company took 2 months to review my case and then recharge the scam amount (twice because they were being sloppy).  5 minutes on Google would have shown the company was a Scam, as I said on day one.

He cashed the check and the following day two payments, which were already scheduled, was withdrawn from my account. My direct deposit arrived the following day. Bofa did refund one of the overdraft fees but refused to return the other, citing an inability to override the system (a lame excuse, at best).

Huh?! How do you come up with 2 different outcomes for the exact same issue??If you are with Bank Of America or thinking about using them, I urge you to go with a smaller bank that actually gives a shit about you. And before anyone says, 'I've been with them for years, and I've been very happy', please know that I've been with them for over 20 years now. I have never once had an issue, but the first time something happens to where I need their support after supporting their institution for 20 over years, I get nothing.Their denial letter told me to contact the person I sent the money to, which tells me they didn't even read the details of my claim before denying it or they would have seen that I didn't send money to anyone!Whatever.

I asked for a manager and finally gave up holding after almost 15 minutes. I've been a long time customer but cannot WAIT until I can get all my banking switched to another bank that wont leave me stranded at night due to a ridiculous policy that was hidden vs. made sure to be communicated in multiple ways to fully prepare customers of the change.

I pay additional principal on the 25th. No problem for years, then in July, acct# was changed so principal only payment goes into \u2018unapplied funds for 4-5 days but when it reflects against my balance, the date is the actual receipt date (10\/25) Once it posted after the 1st of the next month. This means interest is calculated on the higher balance. Is this some kind of interest scam? I plan to confirm everything for the next 2 payments and file a complaint with my state AG for investigaton. Also, since COVID-19, phone call holding time is ridiculous ( I have held for 90 minutes).","3647":"Teller mislead, fail to inform me about my check deposit was going to be on hold. For a whole week.

They effectively stole $1000 from my account after an atm failed to dispense cash that they say was withdrawn.  The branch would not help, and the phone line hangs up after being on hold for 60 minutes.  Had to file a complaint with the CFPB just to get them to initiate an investigation, which they did not conduct in good faith.  There were cameras everywhere, so they know I didn't receive any money, but they refuse to pay the claim.  When I filed the claim, they indicated that if they had not completed their investigation of the claim within 10 days, they would credit my account provisionally while it was resolved.  They confirmed this with a letter indicating that the funds would be available in my account within 2 days.  They failed to properly investigate, failed to provide the provisional credit, and no follow-up to explain why the claim was not paid or the credit provided.  They are shady!","1506":"If I could give Bank of America zero stars, I would. I was a loyal long-term customer and paid my credit card every month on time. Just recently due to lack of activity on my card, Bank of America canceled my credit card with no warning! This in turn affected my available credit and thereby affected my credit score. When I called to get it resolved I was told that they could not open my credit card back up and that I could reapply if I wanted to. I will never do business with Bank of America again since this represents how they treat their customers. I work hard to maintain my credit score and with the swipe of a pen or some computer generated analysis, they can have a significant negative impact without even having to let me know first.","3649":"Above all else is just bad customer service wait times, having to be on hold for over 4 hours for four days in a row is beyond me. Having to explain to each representative my issue and then to be put on hold for 15-20 minutes for them just to come back and say, \"Sorry I have to transfer you to another department,\" and then for that department just to say, \"Sorry I have to transfer you again,\" after waiting on hold from the last transfer.

If you rely on automatic payments, expect a late fee and high interest to welcome you to this otherwise great card with awful customer courtesy. Managing accounts with this company is not any easier, with a mobile app required to acces your account via phone and rewards not showing up until a month later (you can't track them in advance). I highly recommend Discover or Chase, I have had much easier experiences with them, without any of these unnecessary obstacles.","2508":"BOA customer service phone 1800-832-1000 is complete SHAM and Hoax. I dialed this number three times today. When you dial the number it comes with the message \"Enter the number for the person you want to reach\" without providing directory. After three tries it hangs up. Am I suppose to know their F... directory? I have filed a complaint with BBB and very pissed off.","2507":"The service is terrible. I waited more than 46 minutes just for a simple question. They really don't care about us. It seems our time is not time.  I will never bank with Bank of America any more.","1840":"Typical bank loan.

Very poor customer service for a large bank","1842":"Absolute runaround. My 89 yr old MIL was extremely distraught that when calling to reorder her checks she could not do so without incurring an $11 fee as the online reorder defaulted to the previous time she had reordered with tracking. I called 800-652-1111 in an attempt to override via a customer service rep with no luck and the checks were automatically processed w\/o approval. The headache continued when I tried to cancel and was unable to do so when I called back since there was a pending order I could not continue and was disconnected. Finally was routed to a live agent when transferred directly over from customer service, 800-432-1000 number but was told they need to speak to her. Called my MIL from my other phone and put on speakerphone, but no third party calls allowed...UGH! She cannot do this on her own and I am not able to get to her home to help her. The woman at check reorder told me to call back customer service...another 10 minute wait now and they probably won't be of help. Her local BOA branch is closed even if I could get her there to refute charges. So absolutely disgusted as premier members","2509":"After we refinanced with another bank for a lower interest rate recently, Bank of America inactivated our account online right away before refunds us a couple thousand dollars from our escrow, and we have no way to verify the correct balance! The only way to contact them is the 1800 number which is very very hard to reach anyone. Worst yet, it sent us a letter  asking the mortgage payment! We had never encountered any mortgage company like Bank of America. Never ever use it again!","2510":"When covid first set me back I cashed in some stocks and deposited my T.D. Ameritrade check to make up the difference. B of A chose to put a 10 day hold on my Brokerage check. Really? So many auto payments were returned and each was a charge of 35.00. Each bill collecter also charged me 30.00 for return as well as 30.00 late fee. Often they then attempted to redeposit . So each. 30.00 payment cost me over 150.00 before the actual debt was even paid. My account has been short since. Playing catch up was a nightmare. I finally had a friend help me out and I deposited that extra check only to find it too was going to be held 10 days. The same scenario. I attempted to reach someone to fix it but was told that is how it is. Even when. The check clears I must wait the ten days.They closed one of two branches here. The only branch open is way downtown with shorter hours than before. The line are horrendous due to all the unemployment monies going through Bof A. The only bofa atms are also connected to this building. I did not need this extra stress during this already trying time. The extra money set aside for.emergencies was stolen by the banks sudden need to hold my deposits. I am not a new customer. Until this situation I had never had a problem with them.

Being disconnected after more than 30 minutes on hold and having to begin the process again, is common.I do like that you can get 3% cash back on the category of your choice but that extra 1% isn't worth the hassle of dealing with Bank of America. If you love Bank Of America seek professional help but if you're one of those B of A customers who truly love them, this is a great card for you.

When presented with the suggestion that let\u2019s keep the card open and you can text or call to confirm each transaction I am told it must be closed. When I requested to speak with her manager I was told that he, or she, was not available and that she will send me a new card. When I once again explained I am departing early Tuesday morning and will be on the road, she said no problem they can send the replacement card to the address I will be at. For real, is she insane or just plain stupid. I explained, I have no set itinerary and no idea of where I will be, sorry for that, then we will send it to your home address, in essence what she really wanted to suggest is delay your trip for three days so we can send you a new card......my solution, close the account. Unbeknownst to her our corporate bank accounts, employee credit cards will be terminated Tuesday morning.

Had this been done correctly the first time, I may have had a chance to see some money back. Now its 5 days, and scammers are smart and the accounts are probably closed.

It is customary for the payoff amount to include the per diem interest for the current month through the day of closing and an additional 3 days of interest for the refinance rescission period.  In our case 24 days of interest should have been charged as part of our payoff because we closed on 9\/21.  Instead Bank of America charged us interest through 10\/2, and, although I caught the mistake before we closed the refinance loan, the closing attorney said we had to take it up with Bank of America after the closing.  That is where the problem gets worse.They do not answer their customer service phone number unless you stay on the line and wait for hours listening to music. The ridiculous phone menu repeats itself and makes it very difficult to speak to a human being.  And then once you get someone on the phone, they find ways to disconnect the call, and you are back to square one.  On my fourth phone call (after being on Muzak hold for over two hours), I asked the customer service representative to please jot down my phone number in case we got disconnected.  She said should could not do that and promised she would stay on the line.  Of course, we got disconnected as soon as she had to put me on hold to ask someone else my two very basic questions.  I also spent over a week and half trying to use their secure email function and never got a response until today, a week and a half later.  The email response spent more time apologizing for their poor customer service than it did answering my questions; instead, I got a canned statement about my query being sent to their team for further research and that would take another ten days.The bottom line is we were overcharged hundreds of dollars on our mortgage loan payoff and I am finding it impossible to get an answer on when we can expect to receive our money back or even an acknowledgement that they owe the difference. In addition, it will take them 14 - 21 to refund my $5k escrow balance.  Why?  They could easily transfer our escrow balance to our checking account; they have confirmed receiving our full payoff a week ago. But no, it will take several more weeks for BOA to return our escrow fund even though we need those funds to pay our property taxes that are coming due soon.In my opinion, BOA is making money on our funds and the stalling techniques employed are nothing more than terrible customer service layered on top of unethical practices. Our relationship with this bank ends with this experience.  We have been loyal customers for over 30 years, probably 40 but whose counting?","2519":"BoFA keeps deducting our mortgage payment twice every month, in error.

She had money in the account at all times. Unfortunately BofA made a \"business decision\" to close her account without even a phone call.

Within that amount of time she had almost $4000 deposited in her account (that had been unknowingly closed) by family members on her behalf. This is not several weeks later and my daughter still doesn't have her money. What kind of a financial institution would do this to a college student. Additionally, there was no personal contact to her to explain what would be happening, just \"we've made a business decision\" once she contacted them.

I had spoke with many Bank of America reps and even sent an email to executive escalations (because there is no number). Due to BOA screwing me over a 1000.00, I could not afford my apartment and had to vacate. They acted as if they didn't care. In fact, one of the repa even made it clear that in page 54 of the handbook, they are allowed to draft miney from your new account to pay an old one.

He also said he could see i called August 13 but their were no notes asking for the block. I trusted my so called bank to have my back and all I got was BS and the run around. The rep also got dismissive. My problem is not the company,  its with my Bank that lied to me and said they blocked this company. Its time for a new bank...

Eventually, I was able to get back on my feet and repaid the whole balance and had not used the card since April of this year after paying off the balance. I was about to use the card for a rental car in late September, just to keep the card active. I received an email saying my account had been been closed. I called them to inquire and they said that the reasons for the closure had been mailed in a letter to my home, the agent had said that they usually do not close inactive accounts till maybe after 2yrs of non activity on them. Letter came in the mail and said that account was closed due to late payments and non use. I am not fretting about them closing the account, but their reasons for doing so are disingenuous.

They reported late payments to the credit bureau every month and then closed my account.  I have tried unsuccessfully to get them to fix things.  So, it's now been almost 6 months and BOA can take a hike.  I had only had 2 late payments in over 25 years with that bank.  Now, they are screwing up my credit?  I have a letter stating that I was granted the deferment.  Good luck BOA.  I am not going to make anymore payments on that account until this is straightened out.  I even went thru the credit bureau and filed a dispute.  Nope!  They didn't do a darn thing about it.  As a long time customer of BOA, I am sadly disappointed by this turn of events.

Since COVID I have not been paying as much attention as I use to.  Upon reviewing my credit report and using Experian, I realized it was Bank of American reports that were causing my credit score to drop drastically.  I could not figure this out because the two credit cards I had with them were pain in full but not closed.  After three calls to BOA and about three hours of my time, I was finally told that in April 2020, I was sent a letter letting me know that I had a $60 membership fee and after three months of it not being paid the account was closed.  They also reported three late payments to the credit bureau.  How can a company do this to someone or anyone during a global pandemic!!!

I answered yes, and this idiot told me that they will not count my coins, they will have to ship out my can of coins to be counted. Now this is a full service bank, what fool would give you a full can of coins for you to ship out too be counted?I replied, \"ONLY IN THE BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD\" and walked out. If she had said the coin machine was out of order, I could have accepted that.

Since they switched to a new system in August, they keep holding the money that got drafted in Unapplied Funds and don't apply it to my mortgage payment. The September statement shows my payment as late, even though every payment was made. I have spent many, many hours on the phone and sent them several messages through their on-line system. They refuse to stop drafting money automatically and they won't apply it to my mortgage. I am considering some legal options in dealing with them. They hang up on me after I am on hold for hours, keep transferring me to someone else or assign me a case ID number, and then do absolutely nothing about it. The people who pick up the phone cannot apply payment from unapplied funds to the mortgage payment and they cannot remove the automatic payment plan. Since this is their mortgage customer service, I am wondering what it is that they actually CAN do besides keep customers on hold for hours on end and transfer them to each other. I am keeping meticulous records of all my phone calls and hold times in case I actually have no choice and need to report them to the Department of Banking or pursue some legal action to resolve this.","1721":"They repeatedly charged late fees during this pandemic and did not offer any relief even though I lost my job.

My mother thought she had everything in order for her passing - she had a living trust listing me as her trustee, she included her safety deposit box in the trust, she listed myself and my brother as the beneficiary of her accounts. \n\nThey waited a month to send us the paperwork from their internal estate department. The paperwork didn't have very much information in it other than to go into a branch AND they included 3 other claims along with my mom for other people's estates. My condolences go out to the families of *************, *****************, and ****************. We emailed the estate services department letting them know they had done this so that they could get the claims out to the correct families. But we don't know if this ever happened since we never got a response. This was our first red flag. \n\nNext we made an appointment to go into our local branch since that is what the paperwork said. When we got there the bank told us we would have to come back in a week because we have to wait 40 days from passing. It would have been nice if the paperwork included that tidbit. \n\nSo we come back after 40 days and they take all the information from us and tell us that a check will be mailed to us in 3-10 business days. Well it is day 8 and the funds are still in my deceased mother's accounts. AND I have been trying to get a hold of Brenda from North Toluca Lake branch to get us into mom's safety deposit box for 2 weeks. I finally talked to her today and she says we need to fill out a small estate affidavit and have it notarized before we can get to the safety deposit box.... so in the giant packet I received from estate services they didn't think to include this form I would need to fill out and at the 2 bank of america meeting they didn't think that was something they should have told me so to condense all this back and forth. \n\nNot to mention the amount of people I have to talk to and explain that my mom is dead and all the questions that come with it. This whole experience has been a nightmare. My mom has been gone for 2 months now and bank of america hasn't done anything to help us in closing out her accounts. I really just want to be done with this whole chapter of my life but it's hard when you're waiting on other people\/companies to do their jobs. \n\nFun Fact: *********** got us everything we needed in 1 phone call and 1 branch visit. They also provided us a point person so that I didn't have to keep repeating myself. I think I have found my new bank. ","170":"I love my Bank of America credit card and its Security. I also use Bank of America for my other banking needs. The Bank of America credit card is a great way to improve your credit,I recommend!","2540":"Due to the Corona virus and only 1 income I was 2 days late on my payment. I called to see if I could have the late fee waived, mind you ive not had any late payments and a great payment history and they told me they could not do it. The only way is if it were a bank mistake, really is awful this is so out of our control and I believe that in a case of such they should have been able to do so and should have been more understanding  and nor so cold. I wouldnt rate them a 1 at this time but it was the least I could rate. Shame on you Bank America....","172":"Do not use this bank! They scammed me out of almost $300 .

The branch that is open , opens at 10am .... long lines while comerica  and chase do not seem to have the same issue. You call to make an appointment and you cannot get through.

After spending 3 months,  interfacing with 3 employees who were then \"let-go\", and sending tax returns \/ bank accounts \/ 401K documents SEVERAL times (due to their department \"not receiving the docs\") I was sent a form letter indicating I was declined. I'm 70 years old and I know why I was declined. Since then I have tried to make deposits at 3 different branches but they are closed without prior notice. So basically I'm slowly changing banks. It will take a couple of years, but I can't justify doing business with a bank that cares little about retail customers. I'm doing this review so that others will not use this bank.","171":"I was on hold for 3 hours 52 minutes with Bank of America mortgage department to get a refinance quote. Once the call came off hold and was answered, it was disconnected immediately. They did call back a few days later in response to an email I sent. I would recommend they institute a call back system instead of making customers or potential customers hold so long.","173":"I found the mortgage team I worked with very unprofessional and am extremely dissatisfied. There were multiple issues throughout the process and every time I just had to accept what loan officers (and their managers) prescribed or else I would need to go get the mortgage elsewhere. Specific issues:1. Rate lock without consent: The loan officer locked the rate without my consent. When I reached out to the his manager to intervene she offered a solution - I go to some other bank (she'll reimburse me for the appraisal costs incurred so far) or I stay with BofA and the rate stays locked. Being just 2 weeks from my closing date, I had no other alternative but to go with the rate that the loan officer locked without my consent.2. Lack of communication: About 10 days prior to my scheduled closing date, I asked for closing early by 3 days. Loan officer responded saying - I see no issues why we can't. After that I sent multiple emails to the loan officer, loan coordinator and their managers for an update but the next meaningful update I received from them was at 7 PM on the day before closing - At that point they needed more documents from me. Eventually, they closed my loan on Aug 31st after I waited at the title company's office for an hour.3. Bait and switch: The loan officer promised a lower lender origination fees ($785) but told me on the day of my closing that it would be $1135. The explanation: the original quote was for a single family home and he realized on the day of closing that I'm purchasing a condo and hence higher fees. The resolution: On the day of closing when I'm waiting at the title company's office to sign papers, the loan officer calls me, tells me that the fees will be higher and he'll clear the loan only if I accept the higher origination fees otherwise he won't.I have been a BofA customer for 9 years and I am soon going to move to some other bank for the bulk of my banking needs.","174":"Would give 0 stars if I could... basically I had a recurring payment of $3, and since I don't use this account because I transferred to chase, I don't constantly check on it. One day, I didn't have the $3 (you can call that my mistake) and they decided that if I didn't have the $3, I would have an extra $35 for unavailable founds. On top of that, I got charged other $35 for that same transaction. Ended up owing $70 for a $3 transaction. That happened to me twice in this pandemic and it is ridiculous since I've been trying to unlink my BoA account from that service for days. And yet the bank has the gut to tell me that I should stop taking advantage of them waiving fees (they waived the two first after I called twice) when they're the ones taking advantage of people. Disgusting. Not to mention the fact that they charge a monthly fee for god knows what. Also, today I was trying to transfer some money between my Chase accounts, and I did it so fast that I mistakenly transferred to my BoA account... these a*holes want to charge me $30 to get MY MONEY BACK.

After calling back we were once abandoned ut on hold for over an hour.. This time we were cut off.After finally confirm the receipt of the funds its now almost a month and we have not received any release of lein papers. Again, trying to call is futile. Hour long waits.Their excuses? Well pick one.  COVID of course. Aren't all problems with customer service the fault of COVID? Redoing their computer systems.

Sounded great, \"waived payments, late fees, credit reporting for 6 months\". However, surprise, just like their customer service---this was a lie. They did extend my next payment due for 6 months, but each month I received a new 30 day late payment to the credit bureaus! Run! I'm financially okay now but I will never invest again with Bank of America and will always be vocal of how they treated a 14 year customer during a pandemic!","2904":"Bank of America is focused on charging service fees instead of putting their customers best interests first.  They charged my checking account a $12 monthly fee because i didn't direct deposit more than $250 in a single transaction.  I closed my account as a result.  They then targeted my credit card by charging me a $39 fee when I accidentally made my payment 1 day late.  I called for a courtesy credit and they refused.  They are vultures and I would highly recommend that any one with a brain bank elsewhere.  AVOID BANK OF AMERICA unless you like to be ripped off by constant service fees.  They are only interested in profit not your well being.","2547":"During Coronavirus BofA has changed week hrs to 10-4 & closed on Sat.

We used the program to what we were told would bring us current on our payments and put us back in good standing. We were told all missed payments would be tacked onto the end of our loan and we had nothing more to worry about. We were shocked when due to the low interest rate we decided to refinance our home and were informed our home had a lien placed on it by these crooks. Now we have to pay $18000.00 to remove the lien. We were never informed of any lien even after these crooks sold our loan to another mortgage company. Apparently they have done this to thousands of homeowners that won't know until they either refinance or sell their home. I would never go through these crooks for a home mortgage.","615":"Has a very low interest rate. This is a card that is tied to my profession and gives me a lower rate and high cash back.

After 20 years as a customer i attempted to refinance my home mortgage and stay with BofA, but couldn't get any decent service I went thru two loan officers and gave up due to poor or no responses, high quotes (compared to all others), big out of pocket costs, etc... Refinanced start to finish with a new lender in 34 days, no points, appraisal waiver, great service and knocked $500 of my monthly payment while Bank of America was sleeping. $25 monthly \"maintenance\" fee for checking account is a joke.

It seems like they put traps intentionally to find the ways to charge you. I do not recommend this bank.","2548":"I have been with this company for 17 years. I had good credit, 2 accounts (one being a AAA card), and a credit limit of $17,500 on one of my cards. In June of 2020 I paid my card off for the month as usual. In July of 2020 I didn't get a bill in the mail so I assumed it was still zero. The following month I received a letter from them saying they were closing my AAA account because I had not paid the $40 I owed them for July. I didn't know I owed anything. Turned out it was a once a year charge for a website. I immediately paid it. I called in Sept to pay off my card and found that they had indeed closed my AAA card and had taken my other card from a $17,500 credit limit down to a $500 limit and had reported the $40 non payment to all the credit agencies.They are not going to change any of that. So for 17 years I was loyal, careful to make all my payments, had good credit but for $40 they didn't want me anymore. I will be looking for a new bank who values my business. Apparently Bank of America doesn't care about its clients. By the way, there is no one in corporate that you can talk to. You must speak to the people in customer service who answer the phones who have no authority to do anything for you.","617":"Just bought a house and BOA has lost my wire.

BofA mistakenly rejected our regular July 2020 payment on our home equity line, asserting that it should have been sent to NationStar, where BofA transferred our mortgage a few years ago. This was clearly BofA's error. We have been unable to get BofA to correct its error, despite several letters, calls and online communications. BofA is still holding onto our July payment without applying it to our home equity account and has designated us delinquent borrowers. It is apparent that BofA customer service is designed and intended to discourage anyone from using it. We are in the process of closing all of our accounts to moving them to another bank. And we are supposedly preferred customers. Hah! My recommendation is to avoid BofA like the plague.","616":"THE BEST. It's been quite a long time since I've been with BOA and I can only say great things.

I am unable to get to my online account because BoA closed the account without any communication.

But 10 days ago a call (only about 70 minutes on hold) to BoA said that BoA had paid off the balance without any notification or follow up. No online communication available and now going on 105 minutes on hold.

Almost 3 WEEKS later, they are still telling me that I need to make sure my username is spelled correctly, and if not THEN they will have someone contact me.

I am on hold trying to get to the right department to remove charges and late fee from my mortgage payment.  The bank put in a new system recently and it has caused huge problems for BOA customers.  You may want to look closely to your account.  I did not receive notice of the late fee and returned ACH.  The issue is entirely with BOA.  My payments are paid automatically on the 1st of the month.  I had well over enough funds in the account to pay the mortgage.  They then ran the payment request on the 3rd of the month.  BOA has a 15-day grace period for mortgages which I have never used.  So even if there were not funds in the account (which there was) I would still fall under the grace period.  This is Day 2 I have been holding and transferred to two departments so far.  There are long wait times due to the overwhelming customer service issues caused by their system update.  In addition, the customer service employees can only give you their first names and are unable to provide last names or employee IDs.  So as the last person I spoke with said their manager agreed the charges should be waived but their department did not have the authority to waive the fees the problem BOA created.To say I am disappointed is an understatement.  More importantly for me is I want to refinance this home.  Due to BOA institutional issues my credit can be negatively affected.","891":"Call 5 times and every time the system will hang up the phone. Worst customer service.

I had not received any notification from BOA re: proof of delivery.  I ask for a copy to be emailed and she said she could not email me a copy.  They email my statement, but can't email a proof of delivery.  She said she would mail USPS.  Today after 7 days I still did not receive a copy so i called customer service again.

I have two Bank of America credit cards. One I hardly used and this is the card I am writing the review about. I had a zero balance. The yearly membership amount became due and due to all going on with Covid I just plain forgot to pay the bill as I knew I didn't purchase anything so in my mind no balance was due. I did eventually pay the membership fee so the bill was actually 40 days late. When I got the next statement and it showed that the bill was 30 days late I called to dispute it and I was told that the bank automatically reports a 30 days late balance to the credit bureaus. I told them what happened and asked if they could forgive the late payment, not not charge me, but remove the negative credit rating. When I checked with the credit bureaus I found that my credit score lost 45 points! I registered a dispute with the credit bureaus explaining the situation and Bank of America denied the change.

And, with the new system, you can't see your previous balance so it's hard to track how principle and interest are deducted. A Sept. statement is missing from the online view and the documents. Yet, they claim it was paid. Likewise, they keep making it harder and harder for you to pay on principle only towards your mortgage. They had the system down for almost two weeks to fix the online mortgage, yet you have fewer options now than before.

I was really upset after they closed my last one and decided to call they and none of the reps knew what to tell me so they kept transferring me around. I finally spoke to a Supervisor and explained my situation and told him that I either needed a valid reason why my cards were cancelled or needed them to reopen one of my cards. The \"Supervisor\" very rudely told me that they have the right to close my account for whatever reason and that they will not be reopening any of my accounts. This is the way BOA treats their customers especially in a time were we need all the financial support we can get.

In that time, I have never once complained, reported any issues, etc.. However, I was recently a victim of fraud when someone online was able to access my accounts, and long story short, they stole over $5,000 from my Bank Of America checking account. I saw this immediately, and was physically at my nearest branch less than 30 minutes after it happened, and had already called in to report it as well. The money taken from my account was sent to an unknown person via Zelle and Cash App. Bank of America promotes Zelle on their site, and has a relationship with them, so I hoped they would be able to at least stop those transactions from posting since all of the transactions were still in pending status. They did nothing to stop the transactions, and instead told me that they need them to fully process before they can do anything. WHAT?!?! That makes no sense to me at all, but I thought, 'OK, this is their process. They know what they're doing.' I now know that's not the case. \n\nWhen I sat down with the bank rep, I was shaking and in tears. I couldn't believe this was happening! I just bought a house, and have a new mortgage to pay, but I was assured that Bank Of America covers you 100% against fraud. FALSE! If you read the fine print, they don't cover you at all against cyber attacks such as this. The woman contacted the fraud department on the phone, and as I sat in that office, I continued receiving texts showing money being pulled from my account. She saw this, and reported it to the person on the phone. I provided them with all of the necessary info, and after freezing\/closing my accounts and opening new ones, I left with high hopes of getting my money back once they investigated.\n\nI was told the investigations (there was one for Zelle and another for Cash app) could take up to 90 days. I reported this fraud on August 24th; just 9 days later, I receive an email stating the Cash app investigation was closed. They had determined that I would NOT be getting that money back. I went straight to the local branch, looking for an explanation, as the email gave no details of their reasoning. They again called the fraud department, and the man on the phone essentially called me a liar. He said that with fraud, they would NORMALLY see more transaction attempts after the account is frozen\/closed, but since they didn't see this happening, it MUST be fraud on my part; they must have KNOWN the account was frozen! I explained to him that they did in fact make another attempt and Cash app declined it because they apparently recognized it as being suspicious. I had proof of this, which I provided to the bank rep to submit. I understand that many things tend to follow patterns, but to tell me my money is just gone simply because something out of what they consider the norm took place, I was devastated. Did they even look at anything else? Did they take into consideration that I was there within minutes of this happening, literally begging them to do whatever they could to stop those from fully processing? Did they look at the fact that the Bank Of America rep saw the texts coming through on my phone stating money was still being taken from my account? Does the fact that I have more money in there now than I have in my 20 loyal years with them not tell them anything? If I were going to commit fraud, wouldn't I have tried that when I only had a few hundred in my account and was struggling? No, they don't care about any of that. All they look for is ANY reason to deny your claim, and to call you a liar and a thief. \n\nThey have re-opened that investigation in light of some additional things I was able to supply (which I think should have been asked for on day 1), and I am currently waiting for the results of both, but those high hopes I had at the beginning are gone. I have zero faith in this bank to actually look at everything I've submitted, and to try to understand how it feels to have your hard earned money just taken from you. At this point, I've reported this to my local police department, and have spent countless hours on the phone with anyone who will listen. Even the officer that took my report said, 'I can't believe Bank Of America isn't doing anything more to help you'. He told me that he wasn't trying to give me financial advice, but that he'd never do business with them again if he were me. Yes, officer, I would say you're 100% correct on that. \n\nUltimately, being a \"valued\" platinum rewards customer, and being with this institution for over 20 years doesn't mean squat to them. I'm not a millionaire, but I do have a decent amount of money in my accounts. They've certainly made much more in interest off my money than was stolen from me, but that also doesn't matter.\n\nI do hope that the results of that new investigation will be different, and that I'll receive good news on the Zelle transactions, but I'm not confident in this at all. I haven't pulled my money out yet because I feel like they're definitely not going to try to help me if they have nothing to gain from it. I will absolutely be taking my business elsewhere though if they come back with the same response. This means spending several more hours opening a new account with another bank, going through every bill I pay with my bank account one at a time to cancel autopays and set up new ones, and contacting my employer once again to have them change my direct deposit information. It's a huge inconvenience, but I don't feel safe with Bank Of America, and I no longer trust them. \n\nIf anyone has taken the time to read this entire review, I urge you to take your business and your money elsewhere. Find a smaller bank\/credit union that treats you with respect, and actually sees you as a human being, because I would never want anyone to feel like I do now. I feel helpless and defeated. Bank Of America, I wish you would treat others as you would have them treat you, but that's clearly asking too much. \n\nIn the end, Bank Of America is too big to care about one little customer like me (or you!). We're just a bank account number to them, a source of interest for them to profit from, and nothing more. ","2560":"I have been a long term good standing BOA customer for many years. I opened a checking, savings, business, and had 3 credit cards with them. In the last 6 months (during the corona pandemic) they went ahead and cancelled all my credit cards. They sent me a letter listing several generic reasons why they made the decision to close my credit cards. I was really upset after they closed my last one and decided to call they and none of the reps knew what to tell me so they kept transferring me around. I finally spoke to a Supervisor and explained my situation and told him that I either needed a valid reason why my cards were cancelled or needed them to reopen one of my cards. The \"Supervisor\" very rudely told me that they have the right to close my account for whatever reason and that they will not be reopening any of my accounts. This is the way BOA treats their customers especially in a time were we need all the financial support we can get. I am completely dissapointed with BOA and will be closing the rest of my accounts and opening with another bank asap.","2561":"Horrible I have been with this bank for decades and it's getting worse. I have continued to wait  2 hours each month just to get a representative online so I can pay on my principle only. And now that BofA has updated its mortgage system and made it worse, my statements and payments are missing from the only account. And, with the new system, you can't see your previous balance so it's hard to track how principle and interest are deducted. A Sept. statement is missing from the online view and the documents. Yet, they claim it was paid. Likewise, they keep making it harder and harder for you to pay on principle only towards your mortgage. They had the system down for almost two weeks to fix the online mortgage, yet you have fewer options now than before. Seems they are trying their best to discourage customers from paying their mortgage down, asap. Shameful.","2562":"Customer service is terrible, they definitely have training issues. Also not following CDC guidance for Covid-19","898":"Terrible experience. Was in the middle of setting up a primary checking, savings, personal credit cards, business account, getting a secondary real estate loan, and setting up several investment programs. Was disconnected from the representative. Called back in to finish setting up these accounts. As expected, reached another representation on the second call. Asked if it was possible to be transferred to the original representative I was speaking to, so I did not have to restate the purpose of the accounts and the goals for each. The second representative did not know if that was possible and after 40 mins waiting (I could have set up the accounts by this time), he finally reached out to a supervisor to ask if he had the ability to transfer the call. He told me the supervisor had no desire to look into this and didn't even want to speak with me. As a new, potential customer, this was eye-opening to me that I wasn't worth their time. Ultimately, I was transfer to ANOTHER person in their sales department to set up these accounts. After spending an additional 30 mins on the phone, I was disconnected AGAIN.After burning the calories in an effort to do business with Bank of America for over 1.5 hours and the blatant disrespect by the escalation team, I gave up. If you're looking for a bank that will treat you like a person vs. just a number, I'd advise to look elsewhere.","897":"I wish 0 stars was an option. We worked with BOA in purchasing our first home. We asked multiple times what they needed from us, since this was our first home we did not have any experience. On our closing date- with our moving truck fully packed and family there to help move in- they informed us that they needed more information. We gave them the information and they told us they would have it done that day. After THREE more days of waiting they finally pushed our loan through. Our families (10 people) had to sleep on the floor (our furniture was in our moving truck) of our 2 bedroom apartment because of this delay. Through consulting other mortgage loan companies, we found out that the information they asked us for should have been gathered MONTHS before our closing date. Do not work with Bank of America.","896":"Unfortunately, this review applies to business services as well as personal checking and credit cards...I've been a loyal BofA customer for 40 years. They have had my primary banking relationships that whole time which included all personal banking as well as 6 different businesses, over the years.I'm done and pulling\/closing all accounts. They have really become so strictive and limited along with amazing poor customer service. Most of the service people really do try but they are not given the tools or the knowledge to actually be helpful and solve problems.","2563":"Unfortunately, this review applies to business services as well as personal checking and credit cards...I've been a loyal BofA customer for 40 years.

I use it for dining with the 3% benefits I receive. Highly recommended for anyone who likes getting cash back.","3668":"If you have an overdraft of $ 5 they will charge you $35 for each transaction and refuse to waiver. You might have an overdraft of $70 per day for an automated deduction of $10 each transaction. Be careful! Consider your options before getting an account with them.","2565":"I never used them for anything other than a car loan. Well technically it wasn't my choice as after i purchased my vehicle in 2017 the loan was transferred to BOA. You can imagine the look of horror on my Wife's face when i told her (she worked for them in college and has nothing but bad things to say about them and she's a very upbeat kind person). Well i paid the car loan off 3 years early, but they still withdrew extra funds.  I thought this whole process is computerized?  Anyhow i will let you know what happens.","2567":"If I could give a rating of minus 5, that is what this bank deserves.  Arbitrarily cancelled a credit card; informed by email three days AFTER effective date; written notice received nearly a month later which indicated closed for lack of use.  BofA has no ethical scruples and they could care less how their profit driven actions affect the ordinary person.  All this was done in the middle of Covid when people are not using credit cards because of lack of travel, entertainment etc.  Have had this card 22 years with expiration date of 2024.  After a lot of correspondence and telephone calls the bottom line is:  we value profit above customers... you don't use your card enough so we don't want make money so we are cancelling your card.  Further, it is \"standard procedure\" to do it without notice because it is a \"business decision\" that is already a fait accompli and once done, we will not reissue the card.  Absolutely unconscionable!  Go elsewhere... BofA doesn't care about you, only their profit!","2566":"I have had a mortgage 28 years with this company and recently paid off mortgage . They couldn't find wire transfer for 10 days ! You are kept on hold for 90 min to talk to anyone and no one knows answers.

Go someplace else stay clear of this bank . It has been a month of 90 minute wait times and I have sat the out a few times to get no answers to my concerns . A Frustrated never again costumer . Failing rate for service . There should be a spot for a negative or zero rating !","30":"Let me start by saying I always pay my credit card bill on time and in full. I was late to pay by $38 bill by 40 minutes and they charged me a $25 late fee. I called to ask that they waive this fee and they refused. I've been a customer for over 10 years and never paid late once. They really don't care about their customers.","31":"Great card, with 3% cash back on one category (I use online purchase category). That\u2019s perfect for booking vacations and other big ticket purchases they online vendors.","2908":"Constantly trying to get help but their processes are insanely slow and give no information that is important to the customer. I get told one thing but when time passes and I have to call again they said no it's going to take longer than you were told before.","2568":"The only physical location within an hour drive is \"temporarily\" closed with no date as to when they will open. This is the same location that closed their drive through service a couple years ago. Can't use online service for the business I need to conduct. Horrible organization when it comes to customer service.","2569":"Bank of America had never been a good bank, but they were not bad enough for me to take my money elsewhere. But with the Covid-19 pandemic, just how bad they are really has now become apparent and cannot be ignored. They closed all the drive-thru all over my city forcing people to have to use their lobby which means for a simple transaction like a deposit, you have to wait in long line crowded with all the other customers risking everybody's health instead of social distancing and isolating each customer via the drive-thru.  Not only this, but all of Bank of America branches now close at 4pm which means for those of us who work for a living and since there are no drive-thru open in any Bank of America, we can't get to the bank in time.  Even banks like Wells Fargo which is almost as bad as Bank of America remains open until 5pm and have drive-thru stations open. When this pandemic is over, I'm am closing my accounts and taking my money and business elsewhere.","32":"I have had my personal checking and savings and business checking and savings account through Bank of America for years. I am so disappointed and annoyed with Bank of America. 1st stop having drive-up teller's so you have to go in and which they usually only have one live Teller working. Second ATM machines never have cash withdrawal available and since covid they have shut down most of their inside offices. I do not recommend this Bank any longer as they make it more difficult every day to try to do his business and access your money. Wells Fargo and Chase at least still have options and customer service","33":"I had a $15 dollar balance on a credit card that I stopped using. I was billed by a service provider that I forgot about. They kept tacking late fees for 3 months, and when I noticed it, I closed the account by paying in full. At that point, BOA reported me to credit ratings agencies as delinquent. What a bunch of greedy people.","2909":"Do not trust Boa,They are not a ethical company,  please today we have many options and after 22years as a faithful customer I am done, they no longer put the needs and efforts into their customer, {unless they are mercilessly trying to sell a 3rd party credit card or another scam to get your money) research your options and look at reviews on several sites and then Make a informed decision on where to put your money,  but on a side note, if you are a minority  such as myself  ,they are not out for your best interest at all,infact it has been proven that infact they will go out of their way to insure you that you will never obtain a loan big enough to buy a house or send a kid to college,  nope  if they prefer to give out small loans betting on the fact that you will default and then they can reap the benefits of you downfall","2910":"Bank of America Mortgage experience has been one of the worst I have ever faced. We had refinanced recently with another bank and all the funds had been paid off in the previous month but we had forgotten to remove the automatic bill pay from our BofA checking account. An automatic monthly payment kicked in at the start of the month and we paid an additional mortgage payment on the account we had completely paid off. Now I am stuck trying to reach BofA mortgage and it has been a futile experience. Their recent mortgage systems upgrade has been nothing short of a disaster, as I end up waiting for 1-2hrs almost everytime and without being connected to a representative. There is no online contact (online chat or email address) to send our queries and wait for a response, there is no physical branch where you can go to for help ....... it has been truly helpless feeling and not at all worth it. Even the banking experience hasnt been good and will suggest everyone to find another caller.","2911":"Terrible phone support and service.  If you make an auto loan through them you can't get any title information over the phone.  You have to mail in a request to their title department.  My normal bank usually send you your title with a lien stamp on it.  They couldn't even just give me the title number.  Not to mention their phone support menu is ridiculous.  Takes about 5 min just to get where you want through their long-winded menu.  I would have kept my loan open with them but didn't want to deal with them any more with holding my vehicle information from me.  I just paid off the loan and closed it so they will send me my title and I save my money.  Second time dealing with them and their foolishness.  Shame on me.  When will businesses start treating customers like customers again?????","2912":"Bank of America is HORRIBLE! They have a 0% liability policy that is nothing but a lie!","34":"Poor service. I was told over the phone twice that I was approved. Credit score was 770. 2.5 hours later my loan was denied. Don't use this company!","2570":"Terrible customer service. Wont respond to phone calls or letters. Reps drop calls. Will make false reports to credit bureaus.","2913":"If I could give 0 stars I would. NEVER bank with this bank. They hold your checks and claim because it is a new employer they have to hold it! For 7 days you hold my money??! Mind you this is a County check! The funds are there, its not like the check is gong to bounce!! Then you have a limit on how many times you transfer funds from one account to the other! Excuse me but I'll transfer money as I see fit! A $10 fee for transferring MY OWN money between accounts. Ridiculous.\n\nThey don't even ready these complaints because as I went through looking at other complaints its always a copy and paste answer. Smh. At least I can give 1 start so people stop using this bank. Switched banks and no checks have been held since day one!","2914":"I use the bill pay feature to pay my mortgage each month and have been doing so since November. My mortgage company called me and told me I had missed a payment, but the money had come out of my checking account. I called BOA and they sent my mortgaging bank a copy of the endorsed check. However, it showed that it was endorsed at a different bank. I filed an affadavit 5 months ago and have yet to hear back. An entire mortgage payment was deposited into someones random account at Wells Fargo. Everytime I call BOA, they tell me the claim has been escalated and that there is nobody to talk to about it. I had to additionally pay my mortgage that month because they never received the check from BOA and told me it was going to negatively impact my credit. ","35":"Extremely disappointed. They closed my account due inactivity, which I understand is in the agreement, what i dislike is they gave me ZERO notice. I have had other cards give a notice that if a card isn't used they will close the account so of course I make a purchase and then pay it off. Its covid i had an excellent score and was trying to refinance my house for the best rate I could get and this will affect that. Sorely disappointed! The kicker is I actually work in a breast cancer center !","2572":"been a customer for 25 years natwest, fleetnow bank of america when i get a chance I'm pulling everything out you cannot get anything done been on hold totaling 20+ hrs visited bank 7 times and cannot get transaction done. everyone says there on it but nothing they should be ashamed","2571":"This bank will look for any reason to get there hands in your account. They love when you deposit checks when your close to overdraft. This is a bank that will lie and make up any reason not to deposit your check just to put you in the negative. I hate this bank!","3669":"We have a few occasions of checks deposited to our business account that later are marked as \"duplicates\" and reversed. The bank then reverses the transaction and we never get paid for the check. We are super busy and have waited hours online and still not fixed. Then we don't get paid on those checks. This has happened a number of times. I would never have used Bank of America knowing this problem.","2573":"I deposited a check and was told I had to wait 11 days for the check to clear which is ridiculous! I've had my account for at least 5 yrs and during that time only needed to speak to a human twice but both those times it took hrs !!!! To reach a human and both times I was told there's nothing that can be done to help me as soon as my check clears I will be emptying my account and closing it there has to be a banker with better customer service than this inwould rate this place 3 zeros if it were an option !!!! In the most difficult time of my life when I need my money to survive at this point these ignorant people hold my money hostage !!!!!","2575":"On 8\/25\/2020 I called to Bank ofAmerica to ask to lower my credit card payment and also to ask the agent if the late payment reported in April 2020 in my credit report could be deleted. I informed to the agent that I was affected by Covid-19 plus I am a single mother. I was surprised about the bad experience I had when talking to the agent who name is Amie. The agent raised her voice to tell me that I should know better better, that I had to call them to let them know. I explained to her that I lost a family due to Covid but she just ignored my comment. Also, she said that my minimum payment cannot be lower but only deferred. I have 10 years being A customer in BoA. I will be paying what I have pending and then closing my account. Terrible customer service","2574":"I have been a customer for 6 years & I have no complains. Good for Credit cards, checking accounts, ATM. I pay my credit card timely & if you have the money you are spending, no worries really. Go to your local banks \/ credit union for loans & mortgage maybe but your average banking needs can be met well with the big banks. If I had to take a loan I would go to First Republic Bank. You can't expect BOA to treat you like First Republic will & they are unlikely to ever know you personally. So long as you are aware of that you should have no problems. I absolutely loved Shopsafe which they got rid of. That's a pity. Due to CCP virus their customer service waiting times are awful. The estimated wait time I once got was ~80 min & I hung up, called later & got a rep within 10 min. Please hire more people. I never encountered any employee in my local branch or on phone who hasn't been nice & willing to help. I guess people post negative reviews when they have bad experiences but people rarely take time to post good reviews about their good experiences.","37":"This started as a $300.00 secured card. After a year of paying on time they converted it to a regular credit card. My $300 was deposited into my checking account & my credit card limit was set for $1300.00.

Which online they advertise if you need any help please contact us. Absolutely no help, they refused to help me after calling them for over an hour. They even refused to get the supervisor for help and in my last call they couldn't get a hold of a supervisor. I was asking for help because it's going to take 2 days for the transfer to go through. Which I obviously cannot wait for 2 days because I have no food in my house, all they kept saying was no no no we do not care about your personal situation and that you have to wait for 2 days and there is ABSOLUTELY nothing we can do for you. I even asked is it because the card is bankofamericaEDD and am not a real BOA costumer they said oh no no its not that.

But there is a happy ending to the story:  after some research, I applied later that day with a new company Figure online for a $45,000 HELOC with a low interest rate and monthly payment & was approved the same day with funding being deposited into my bank account 5 days later.

I asked what the reason was & he REFUSED to give me one & just stated it was a business decision. When I asked when I would receive my money back & if I could go to a branch to get my $3,000+ he stated I would receive it in the mail within 7-12 business days and going to a branch was not allowed.

As a small business owner its clear this bank only cares about big $$ and has discriminated me. what establishment doesn't give a clear reason why? this is so they can discriminate for any reason. Why did they not just call me directly? cause they don't care and expect me to go down to a branch during covid and get me or others to be exposed to being sick.

It's been a month since I set up my account and I still haven't been able to access my online banking bc of all the bs steps I have to go through. I have called and gone into the branch to verify and I have to call customer service again (when I have 30 mins to an hour to wait on hold) to get my access code. Horrible experience.","2583":"Terrible customer service...sat on phone for 2 hours only to get a recording asking me to leave a message and get a call back in 2 days.  Had a person tell me I would receive a document I was waiting for last week only to not receive it and be told today it will be another 10 days.  Have been on hold several times in the last 2 weeks where it took at least 90 minutes to answer with no help.","2584":"After a VERY frustrating experience, on the phone, trying to get an insurance claim check an endorsement number I walked in to a Bank of America branch and Abraham Ackah helped me through the process. He even waited on the phone for 3 HOURS to get the number I needed. I was considering changing banks but BECAUSE of Mr. Ackhah, I will be staying with B of A!!!","444":"So prior to the 2008 financial meltdown my wife and I use to be faithful customers to BoA for over 10 years. Since the gov't bail out of financial institutions we have noted the online customer service has declined to new lows as it is virtually impossible to get a person on line through their automated system. Of course do not forget the 30-60 minute wait time. This is all because I have an automated mortgage payment that was set up prior to the mess and just recently received a bill in the mail indicating that I need to make the mortgage payment due to an upgrade on their system. AAARRRGGGHHH! This is my problem because as they clearly indicate if payment is not received by such date there will be a late fee charged to the account. Needless to say we need to add a late fee for their aggravation and lack of service.","2585":"They did not issue my debit card despite repeated requests. I lost access to my account after my old debit card expired.","445":"Have this cc for a Lonnnnng Time, 17+years. Was OK then, there are much better cards out there now. You would think BOA would step up their perks for long time customers with this card. But no... So it's a sock drawer card...","446":"Why so mean and grumpy all the time? It doesn't matter which branch we've tried. This bank is the least accommodating, helpful, welcoming and useful. Yes, we are a small account and rarely have more than $20k on deposit but, really? We are in the process of moving our business account to another institution even with all the hassle of notifying autodraft accounts and getting signatures. Enough is enough!","447":"Last November got a car loan through BOA at 7.5% have been a Platinum Customer with the bank for 20 years. Last month contacted a credit union and was given 3.5% on a car loan due to excellent credit score. Needless to say Loan was switched over to credit union and BOA lost out. Cancelled all credit card, closed savings and checking account and took ALL my banking business to OBee Credit Union that offered better service, higher rates on savings and checking account, better credit card rates and over all was a much better place to leave my money. BOA has grown so BIG that even trying to talk to someone is a hassle and time consuming just trying to get past the ROBO operator and then being put on hold 20-30 minutes. This is Bank does not value it's customers time or care about helping you better your finances.","2586":"I've had numerous bad experiences with BOA, but decided to write a review after this last one. I have a $50k check I sent to the IRS. I have a notice from the IRS that I now owe more because they never received payment. I tried to get BOA to help me understand where the money is. It is not in my account, etc... After 1+ hours on the phone, transferred 3 times I finally asked for someone empowered to do something. Transferred again I asked this person to give me a # or something in case we were disconnected. \"we wont get disconnected\" he said as he put me on hold again. Then we were disconnected.  Like I said, this is typical with BOA so I finally decided to put it in writing to see if I can help them wake up a bit and address the real issues. More overly gushy, insincere, awkward greeters is not what is needed to fix the real issues.","2920":"This location has been closed. Very disappointed in Bank of America and service provided at the location I have to travel to for my money.","3670":"I've had numerous bad experiences with BOA, but decided to write a review after this last one.

Not everyone can bank Mon-Fri because we are off by the time you all close. Some of us needed to go today, and by closing everything, now ai won't be able to fix what I had to until next effin week and god forbid you start closing all Saturdays because if that is the case, I will be looking for a new bank.","448":"On two occasions Bank Of America has held money and this money you can\u2019t find it on your statement online when you call they act like they don\u2019t know anything about it and when you call call back for fraud they hang up on you yet the first time it happened immediately that same day at night the money was deposited into my accountNow they mess with a bill that I had negotiated with the company to pay the company never received the money yet the money was taken out of my account a warning anyone who wants to invest do not put your money in Bank of America unless you have a sharp eye To always watch your account.","449":"I have the worse experience with BOA, I have a secured credit card with them , I opened the credit card with 2500 deposit , they told me \u201c it\u2019s great for rebuilding credit\u201d according to what they said that after 12 months they will give my deposit back ( 2500 ) . It\u2019s a lie , they keep your money no matter what. It has been 26 months since I got the secured card , I asked them twice to give me my deposit back . No luck .I went from from 584 FICO score to 670 during this time period (2 years ) I have been making all my payments on time , I have a discover card with 10000 dollars spending limit among other cards with stellar payment history according to Equifax 682 ; TransUnion 665 ; and Experian 660 . I have been rebuilding my credit for 2 years now , I don\u2019t understand if they have this secured card program to give people chances to do the right thing , why BOA have to be so tough and denied my graduation from secured to unsecured credit card ; and don\u2019t give the money back ( 2500 ) on top of it.Disgusting.","3672":"On August 13th 2020 at around 3pm I talked to VANESSA who works in the consumer and small business department and I had the WORST experience I have ever had being a Bank of America customer. Backstory: I opened a business bank account on August 7th. I called in to open an online account and I was told that I could not open an online account because I did not have my checking account number and I was also told that I had 7 days to fund the account and that I had to go in person to do so since I didn\u2019t have my business debit card or my business account number yet.","1230":"The travel center\/customer service is incompetent. I resolved the travel issue myself with American Airlines. I was transferred five times today trying to cancel the card. Total incompetence! The rating should be a zero star.","2921":"Bank of America stole $620 from my credit card account and they are stalling to not give it back. My account was finally correct as of 04\/06\/2020. 5 days later, BOA created a claim and closed it in the same day 04\/11\/2020 (********) and charged me $620 as a duplicate credit, I called 04\/13\/2020 and I forced to speak with claims manager, Carmen called me at 4:00pm after I waited for her the whole day. And the bottom line of the phone call is to tell me \"just wait and see\". Since then I have provided 2 sets of evidence that BOA did the mistake, one set from their own claim records and transactions records. The second set was a fax on 05\/06\/2020 of 6 pages, which they stated they received and it contains information from ******* website as a prof of the same information I have provided before. Since April they marked the Claim(XXXXXXXX) status as \"Researching Claim-Excluded\", I called 3 times and I asked what \"Excluded\" means, I have received 3 different explanations which none of them made any since, here the website Note on this status:\n\"Please feel free to check the online messages and status throughout the claim process.

On entering was intercepted by \"**\" who asked reason for my visit. I said to make an EDD \"PREPAID\" a\/c withdrawal. I asked for advice e.g. if I could instead withdraw at ATM using my Edd card or at home on my computer? She incoherently rambled on instructing convoluted withdrawal options. I replied, \"I'll wait in the line thanks.\" On reaching the teller position I explained what I wanted, providing EDD card, personal a\/c card, and driver license. The young lady teller attending said my D\/license had expired.","2922":"Today was the first time I entered a bank since the pandemic started. I was annoyed the whole 1.5 hours I stood in line just to make a cash deposit for my employer. I am very understanding of the situation we are in so I didn't give them a bad rating. I just wish there were more than 2 tellers available. Most bofa's are closed with limited hours so I would have expected them to have every other teller open, yet, there was only two for all customers. Not even a merchant line.","2588":"If I could give BANK OF AMERICA, ZERO stars.... that's what I would give them!  OR EVEN MORE ACCURATELY, I WOULD GIVE THEM NEGATIVE 5 STARS!!!! I PRAY THAT I CAN SAVE OTHER CREDIT CARD USERS FROM THE SAME MISTAKE, IN USING THE BANK OF AMERICA CREDIT CARD. THEY, ABSOLUTELY DO NOT HAVE YOUR BACK!!!!! AND THEY ALLOW UNSCRUPULOUS COMPANIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF INNOCENT PEOPLE. MOST CREDIT CARD COMPANIES WILL HAVE YOUR BACK, WHEN YOU COME ACROSS COMPANIES THAT ARE SCAMS. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I THANK GOD! AND AM EXTREMELY GRATEFUL WHEN I HAVE A CREDIT CARD THAT SUPPORTS ME, WHEN IT COMES TO UNSCRUPULOUS COMPANIES!!! BUT, SADLY BANK OF AMERICA DOES NOT!!!!!! WHEN YOU CALL AND ASK FOR HELP, THEY MAKE IT SOUND LIKE THEY ARE, AND TELL YOU NOT TO WORRY ABOUT IT! BUT, THEN TURN AROUND AND THEN TELL YOU, THEY CAN'T HELP YOU AND NOW IT'S TOO LATE BECAUSE YOU'RE OUT OF TIME! BANK OF AMERICA IS THE MAJOR ONE THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR! I'M EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE, AND EXTREME LACK OF SUPPORT. THEY SOUND VERY NICE ON THE PHONE. AND MAKE IT SOUND LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO BE OK! I TRIED ORDERING SOMETHING I SAW ONLINE, THAT OFFERED YOU, A FREE SAMPLE ONLY HAVING TO PAY $4.95 FOR SHIPPING. THEY ENDED UP CHARGING ME $195 AND THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT! I CONTACTED THE COMPANY AND THEY REFUSED TO HELP WHICH WAS NOT SURPRISING SINCE THEY'RE NOT A TRUSTWORTHY COMPANY, TO BEGIN WITH! SO I CALLED BANK OF AMERICA. SADLY, THINKING THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE MY BACK. AND, IN THE END, THEY DID NOT!!! I WILL NO LONGER BE USING THIS CARD AND MAKING THAT MISTAKE AGAIN. I HOPE THAT I CAN SAVE OTHERS FROM THE SAME PAIN! I RECOMMEND NOT USING THIS CARD AND SAVING YOURSELF, A LOT OF MONEY AND HASSLE IN THE LONG RUN. I HOPE THAT YOUR ABLE TO PAY IT FORWARD, AND HELP OTHERS. TO SAVE YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY FROM HAVING TO GO THROUGH THIS HEARTACHE. NO MATTER WHAT THEY'RE OFFERING YOU IN EARNING POINTS TOWARDS SOMETHING. IT'S SOOOOOO NOT!!!! WORTH IT! THEY TAKE WAY MORE THAN THEY GIVE!!!! PLEASE HELP ME, IN EDUCATING THE PUBLIC! I DON'T WANT ANYBODY, TO HAVE TO SUFFER WHAT I WENT THROUGH.(I WENT THROUGH THIS, YESTERDAY, FOR HOURS, AND IT WAS MY BIRTHDAY, NEEDLESS TO SAY, THAT IT TOOK MY ENTIRE DAY. THE ONLY PRESENT I WANTED WAS SUPPORT, IN HAVING TO DEAL WITH A COMPANY, THAT WAS A COMPLETE GIMMICK\/SCAM. AND STOLE MY MONEY. ESPECIALLY, AT THIS TIME, GOING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC AND NOT MAKING ENOUGH MONEY, EVEN TO COVER LIVING EXPENSES. I SAVE EVERY PENNY AND CUT EVERY CORNER AND DENY MYSELF EVERYTHING, JUST TO SAVE WHATEVER I CAN. IT WAS A FLUKE THAT I FELL FOR THIS GIMMICK AND SPENDING THE $5 FOR SHIPPING WHICH IS SOMETHING, I NORMALLY  WOULD NEVER DO! IT WAS JUST A WEAK MOMENT.

BECAUSE I AM CONSIDERED A PIONEER IN THAT FIELD HAVING AN ADULT DAUGHTER AND HAVING TO GO THROUGH YEARS, AND YEARS, OF DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS. TESTING, AFTER TESTING, AND AFTER MORE TESTING! AND ALL THE PRESSURE THAT IT CAUSES. ESPECIALLY BEING A SINGLE PARENT, WHEN AT THAT VERY CRUCIAL TIME, WHEN YOU, YOURSELF NEED SUPPORT, THE FATHER DECIDES THAT HE CAN'T DEAL WITH IT. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT IS ALL TO COMMON! I also grew up in a tremendous amount of pain. (That continues to this day). Taking almost two decades before finally finding out that I had arthritis. Eventually was diagnosed with two forms of arthritis, fibromyalgia, sacroiliitis, spinal stenosis, and major migraines. After years and years of dealing with doctors who told me it was in my head. Telling my parents, I was looking for attention, when I would say I couldn't go outside and play because my knees hurt really bad. Or it was just growing pains. I now, support many people in their life with chronic pain. Because unless you live with it, it's very hard to understand. And have compassion. Because most people get tired of hearing you complain about the pain. So you, eventually, learn to bite your tongue and just plaster a smile on your face and just tell everybody you're fine. So long ago between my chronic pain, and having a daughter with autism (which was extremely rare back then because it was mainly found in boys.) I've learned that I've gone through difficult, decades of all that. So that, I'm able to help others get through the same things in life. So I'm trying to look at this horrible experience with Bank of America as one of those things that I have to go through, so that I'm able to help others.

I inquired with the bank manager, but to no avail.   They explained that someone \"higher up\" won't let them.   Instead, they put an extended hold on my check  due to the amount.\n\nHad they been forthright with me from the beginning, I would have made the deposit elsewhere.\n\nI have been with Bank of America for 19 years.

It's like this bank has automation script running that searches accounts with low balances THEN charges their fees, so they can then overdraft your account and then charge an overdraft fee. Leaving this bank after being customer for over 10 years. This bank has screwed me over long enough. ","2593":"Terrible customer service.

There are other banks.","2925":"Bank of America's mortgage branch has been in a steady decline for many months.\n\nIn March 2020, we received notification from our town that we were delinquent on our sewer tax from the previous year. This didn't make sense, as we have an escrow account for our mortgage; it is the bank's responsibility to pay ALL city taxes, and BofA makes a nice fee from us to ensure timely payment from our escrow account. My wife and I said, \"What the heck do we have an escrow account for if the bank can't even pay your taxes on time?\" We contacted a BofA representative, described our case, and even sent a lengthy email to her describing their mistake. After our call, WE NEVER HEARD FROM THE WOMAN AGAIN, she repeatedly ignored subsequent communications.\n\nNow, here we are in August 2020, and BofA is 'upgrading' their mortgage website. The upgrade has been nothing short of a disaster. We noticed an egregious error on our most recent mortgage statement where the bank was charging over $8k for a 'county tax'. County tax?? Where we live, our taxes go to the CITY,there is no 'county tax'\n\nAfter a 90 minute wait to speak with a customer support representative, I was told that the new BofA mortgage 'upgrade' had been a huge source of issues, thousands of other customers have seen similar erroneous\/inaccurate charges to their account. The representative was brand new to the job, and the system is new, so he put me on hold 3 more times. I was then transferred to a more experienced rep, who again put me on hold, and then shortly after terminated the call. He hung up on me!\n\nWe have been customers with BofA for 20 years; I have a mortgage through them in the mid 6 figure range. I have never felt so neglected as a customer after this experience. 2 hour wait, and then hung up on. When time and conditions permit, we will be moving ALL of our mortgage and cash accounts out of BofA. We don't feel comfortable dealing with an institution that has such awful customer service, NOT to mention the privacy and data security concerns of this 'system upgrade'; it seems to me charges from one customer's mortgage are being applied to another customer's account!\n\nBe very wary of this company, both in terms of customer service and financial security\/accuracy.","1239":"Worst credit card, worst customer service.

There are very few tellers working and the wait is often quite long. When you go in to sit down with any agent, there is also a long wait. It always looks like they are just sitting around and not ready to help. I try to do most of my banking online as their app seems to cover most of my needs.","2595":"Bank of America is without a doubt in my opinion the most uncaring, non-customer oriented bank I have ever worked with.  They say how customer focused and caring they are - garbage.  They couldn't care less.  Here is why I feel this way.  I have had a credit card account with them around 15 years with excellent payment history.  I was late on one payment and they cancelled my account.  No phone call, no text, no is everything all right just a letter in the mail saying they had cancelled my account.  I even called the Vice President of the Customer Service department.  Her useless comment was I could apply for another card.  That's something I don't think they will have to worry about from me.  What a two faced hypocritical company. I would do everything possible to avoid doing business of any kind with them.  Maybe if they treat enough other people like they treated me they will loose enough customers they will go out of business.  I will certainly tell everyone I know to avoid them like the plague.","3629":"I had many different types of accounts with the Bank of America since opening my first account in year 2008. To date, all accounts operate and have always operated exactly as advertised. Never seen their website down. Never had any problems with any transactions (plastic card, electronic transfers, checks, etc.). BoA is quick to resolve fraudulent charges. Staff members across multiple branches I visited in those years have been welcoming and professional. I believe I am a tough rater, but I cannot think of anything else to even wish for. Through those years of 100% proven reliability I have gained a great confidence in the bank.","3676":"Every time I enter a Bank of America I am greeted by someone near the door or a friendly teller. The bank's app save me a lot of time with its check deposit, transfer between accounts, bill pay and transfer to another person features.

God forbids if you need a help and want to get a hold of a representative or even set an appointment for yourself. It is IMPOSSIBLE and after hours they will not be able to help you.

It\u2019s an amazing bank versus Chase and Wells Fargo, both of which I\u2019ve had before. The only downside is the $35 overdraft fee. It\u2019s a bit problematic for any bank to have such a high fee. Logically speaking, if a person already can\u2019t afford something what makes you think they could afford an extra $35? Otherwise love this bank.","2596":"On the evening of July 26, 2020, I have faced a stranger who has lied, tricked, and persuaded me to withdraw and give him $260. He has said that my boss (Pete Barker) at my job (Variety Wholesalers Inc.) would pay me back. But, I have never gotten my money back at all. So, I tried to contact Bank of America (BoA) about this despicable act against me. The Bank of America website has no email communication at all. I have tried calling the bank a few times. However, the BoA employees are too busy with other customers. I have to return to work sadly. Another disappointment is that a BoA location has permanently closed in my city (Henderson, North Carolina). Some other locations in other cities are closed. So, I have to ask my boss about leaving the job early in order to visit a location that is currently opened until 4:00 PM. I have to drive for a hour or longer there which is in Raleigh. I have tried to report the imposter scam issue to BoA employees there. Unfortunately, they cannot or would not solve it. As a result, I have withdrawn most of my money from my BoA account. On the following week, I have permanently closed my BoA account. I refuse to continue doing business with a national company (Bank of America) that does not want to give me justice or solve my issue at all. Plus, I refuse to face another scam in my life ever again.","3630":"I have banked with Bank of America (BoA) ever since they were NCNB. I\u2019ve seen the highs and the lows, as they say, with BoA development and my own financial challenges. The one thing I will say is that I\u2019ve always been able to go to a branch, or call a number and have an issue clarified, explained or resolved, usually in my favor. Currently, I am a \u201cPlatinum\u201d member customer (never thought I\u2019d see the day), so I enjoy a number of perks. I like that I have BoA AND Merrill Lynch at my fingertips and easily accessible on the BoA app. I study the operations of other financial institutions, and while there\u2019s some innovative ideas they present, such as Capital One\u2019s \u201ccafe\u201d set up, I\u2019ve seen those innovative ideas come and go (Washington National [Wachovia] tried it back in the 2000\u2019s). Slow and steady wins it, for me. That\u2019s what BoA does for me.","3678":"I have enjoyed banking with BOA since day one. The customer service is second to none and their site is very user friendly. The ATM is the best feature they have. I appreciate that I can deposit checks and cash there which I couldn\u2019t at my previous bank.","1002":"I've had the Bank of America Cash Rewards Credit Card for a little over 2 years, and so far it's been able to meet all of my needs. The bonus categories are broad enough that it's really easy to find one that you spend a lot of money on, and the customer service that BOA offers in general has been really helpful.","1003":"Decent card Alaska Airlines rewards. I have 4 Bank of America cards but this one is the one I choose to use the most. Overal satisfied","3677":"Bank of America is very happy to help you any way they can. If I needed a loan they are there to help you with it. They have been my bank for over 40 years. I would say they are worth talking to.","3681":"Super helpful when needed. Tellers personable. Have not needed other services other than checking account and purchasing cashier's checks. Only disappointment is the inability to re-finance my care through them as I had a credit blemish 12 years ago.","3680":"Bank of America is solid, Competitive bank. My only criticism of the bank is that the fees, and charges excessive. I have often said that they would charge you for the air you breathe if they could. But, all in all, they seem to be the best of the bunch.","3679":"They never have enough tellers to take care of the customers and you always need to wait too long to get helped. My time is important and I just don't have time to wait behind 12 people with one window open.","2928":"I deposited a Bank of America cashiers check for $2876 and their employees on two different occasions told me if the chick turned out to be counterfeit I would not be responsible for the funds and they would be reimbursed to my account. The check turned out to be counterfeit and Bank of America charged my account for the full amount in spite of what several of their employees told me Including one supervisor. They took no responsibility whatsoever for what their employees swore to.","1005":"They were unwilling to convert the secured card With an unsecured card. Which is why I chose to close the card at that time period.","1004":"I have had a business account for 14 years with bank of America and I am a platinum member, i did not have many issues till the last 2 years, in the last 2 years almost any large check deposit that i do will get a 12 hold on it, all of them are cashiers check issued by other banks, credit unions or finance companies, i would call them and they always give me the same BS excuse \"we had a returned check recently from company x who issued this check so we have to put a hold on it for 12 days\" always same BS excuse regarding who the issuing bank is. there is no way that now a day with today's technology it takes 12 days to verify a check from a local bank and on top of that to give the same excuse regardless of the issuing bank, i will be switching my business banking at the end of the year, and recommend for any business owner to avoid dealing with them","1007":"The Rewards and cash back programs are hard to navigate and interest rate is very high. Also, very difficult to receive credit limit increase","1006":"I did a transfer from another card to the Bank of America card and working to pay it off. I have not charged anything new since the transfer.","2597":"They closed my account for no reason staying was a business decision.One I don't have a business I have direct deposit to my job and they will not let me open my account againVery unprofessional they don't even give you a heads-up or nothing and then want to send you a cashier's check in the mail for what you have in the bank very inconvenient","2598":"Bank of America I would give them 0 stars if it was an option. My branch has been closed for 4 months while all the other Banks and Credit Unions have been opened. It's ridiculous to have a branch in town and not being able to use it. Bank of America doesn't care about the little people that's why people leave and go elsewhere.  Credit Unions have proven that during this pandemic they can serve you better than these other banks that say that customers are their most important asset. I will be closing all my accounts and moving on. This bank doesn't care and why should they. They have big business behind them. I've got an idea lets change the name to Bank Of What Was America. We have to work hard for our money so let's decide what's better for us.","1008":"3100 Crow Canyon Place San Ramon CA 94583 NEVER ANSWERS THE PHONE. I tried several times.

Could very well be a waste of time.That is not good customer service. Can't answer the phone ever? Try harder.Update: I drove all the way there and waited in the lobby. The security guard asked if I had an appointment. I said I could not do anything because nobody answered the phone at all.

I explained everything to the Bank of America dispute representative. I honestly thought Bank of America was my friend and believed me for all of my many years of loyal service. I suspect after Bank of America discovered that I am legally disabled in ******** that they no longer believed me and took the side of ***. I told them that the *** store manager was abusive and almost refused to sell me the phone.I implored Bank Of America that the last thing anyone would do during a pandemic is fabricate a story just to get a free phone .Heartless Bank of America could care less.All of those years of be a loyal reliable customer are for nothing.Now I want the whole world to that Bank Of America discriminates and harassed the disabled.

We have very positive experience with opening new account, bill pay and day to day banking.","3684":"BOA has been our bank since their beginning. I believe them to be above average on customer service and services. But as a senior citizen, I feel they should have special programs and assistance for this demographic.","3685":"I thoroughly conducted market research before decided to shift the majority of my accounts to Bank of America and I haven't stopped referring people since. Even when I lived in a state without one, I found the technology sufficient to continue using them as my primary institution. Wonderful help!","2930":"Been a customer of their's for years but now I find myself in a position where they literally won't accept any cash deposits into my own account. How is it that that a bank, a financial institution, won't accept the national currency of the country they are in? Doesn't that just seem illegal? On top of that, because of their choice to no longer accept my cash money, they have fined me money for overdrawing my account. All I can say is that this treatment is absolutely criminal.","2599":"This used to be very professional bank , but now it has started stealing money. They were charging fees on my savings account over a year without informing and were sitting on a $4000 merchant refund credit on the credit card account due to a merchant refund, even after repeated calls they haven't credited those funds to my checking account so i can have access to them.","3686":"While they make representations regarding availability of funds deposited funds, without notice BoA extends availability of funds one day at a time. It\u2019s completely unacceptable and unprofessional. Find another Bank. If I could give boa a zero, I would.","1009":"A wonderful company doing business with but when I went over to see you they just dropped me I notified them as soon as I got back but they would not open my account back up I was very disappointed","3687":"We have been with BOA for many years and they have always been there when we needed them. Our house is on a sinkhole and BOA paid off our loan in a very timely manner and we could not have been happier.","3688":"Representatives are extremely helpful. They are always very pleasant and eager to help. They are quick to respond. Have been dealing with BOA for 21 years and have no negative issues. Their App is user friendly.","2600":"Warning people! This terrible and unprofessional bank like Pnc . Suntrust . Hsbc all of them have worst customer service. Don\u2019t even out your application they will turn you down with rude demands like tax return etc They should go bankrupt and don\u2019t serve people !! Stay away !","3689":"Their app is user friendly. One time I had a scam charge on my credit card and they immediately credited me the amount and reissued a new card and account number. They also offer rebates on groceries and gas charges which gives you a credit to any account with the bank you choose.","2350":"I don't have a credit card with bank of America. This is a false information that I want to dispute. I don't know who put this wrong statement on my credit report","2351":"Easy online loan process. Platinum members ask for your 0.50% loan discount rate. Once approved they willYou can sign all documents online and they\u2019ll fed ex the check to the dealer. I didn\u2019t have to step inside the bank... all online now.","3690":"Bank of America is regarded as one of the worst banks for both customer service and account service in general. The loan department has to be among the worst in the nation. They regularly over promise and under deliver. The volume of negative comments and horrible things people report to me as a realtor is astounding. It\u2019s hard for me to imagine the company continues as one of the big players. It proves how change averse consumers truly are.","3691":"B of A has been my bank since 1968. I have been very pleased with what they offer. They're very professional with me. I just wish, that B of A of stayed in our community and not closed their doors. There is no BofA for over 60 miles away. I'm very unhappy about that.","3692":"I love that I can bank from my phone. I have had great results when investing, asking questions about my accounts and securing credit card. I was able to get a mortgage when purchasing my manufactured home.","2354":"Just no value for the card. No upgrade path or downgrade path. Waste of a slot in any kind of card configuration with other cards. Don\u2019t get this one for sure","2931":"Very frustrated, several locations are closed. You can't pull money from the ATM, because the ATM's are empty, and you cannot reach a live person at some locations. ","2353":"I received a suspicious email. Contacted fraud. Wait so long that I left my number. Someone called back and said I needed to talk with Fraud, 30 min later, Kara came on line. Said I needed to talk to claims department.

HIRE SOME PEOPLE!!!","2601":"This bank decided to close my account one day without my consent or telling me. And when I called they said they have decided not to tell me why and that\u2019s it. They held all my money for days and didn\u2019t care that I was unable to provide for myself during a pandemic ! Please avoid this bank","3631":"My only problem with Bank of America is they don't have individual health savings account. My company does not offer this as a benefit but my company's health insurance does qualify under the IRS rules as a high deductible health plan. I would like to open one for myself but BOA does not offer it so I need to go elsewhere to open this type of account; which is a pain since all my banking accounts are with Bank of America.","2352":"Dreadful service. The phone rings and rings and if you get through and choose who you want then you wait 30 minutes to get through again. Not worth even one star but couldn\u2019t do less.","2355":"My bank SC Federal Credit Union Submitted the wrong amount on my February payment instead of 500 dollars they sent in 5dollars which caused all the confusion I did do a dispute the same and it should have been removed already but it still showing a late payment we haven\u2019t ever had a late payment in almost 15 years to date.","3694":"We've been with BOA for over 35 years and have no issues except their limited hours. My husband likes to be able to go in and make his deposits but even the drive-through is limited now (outside of the effects from COVID.)","3693":"The customer service at the local location where I reside is not the best. I know that everyone is using the excuse now that the virus is affecting customer service. It's not a surprise to me. It is extremely \"funny\" that when it's time to take money out of my account. The banks are quick to do just that but take days to put the money back into your account. Why is it so hard to put the money back into the account that is associated with that bank? It typically takes 1-3 business days for the refund to process into your account, depending on how your bank processes the refund, and for the funds to appear in your bank account. This is illogical. It is a insult to the consumer.","3695":"What made our experience at the Bank of America outstanding was the customer service. The tellers and bank manager cared and showed empathy. The Frontline employees who served us were very helpful and considerate as well as kind and always trying to please.","3696":"This bank is anything but \"American.\" Plenty of bad experiences, but the worst was when my son, who had enlisted right after the September 11 terrorist attacks, tried to close his account. Miles from home, he called, he wrote, he tried numerous times to close his account and withdraw the money he had in the bank. It was easier for him to use the credit union on the military base. Bank of America refused to work with him. Instead, they charged him outrageous fees until his balance was depleted.","3697":"I had to tolerate an Area Mgr at a BofA Financial Center who just could not understand my plight despite evidence, documentation, re invalid CC charge. It cost me time and aggravation! Finally, their Area superior intervened.","3698":"I was an account holder for 38+ years, dating back before BOA took over Fleet Bank. They have charged fees over and over that required extensive phone calls that are not fun, added monthly charges when they were not supposed to etc. The icing on the cake and why I finally dropped them permanently, was when they did not protect me when my son got caught up in a \"Zelle scam\". Ultimately withdrew $1000 from my account, separate from my son's account but connected through my wife... Follow that? Well, I couldn't either! Cost ME $1000.00, they couldn't care less when I told them what they did was illegal and I was closing my account! Rude customer service, not helpful at all! Do not expect them to have your back.","3700":"I have been a B of A customer for over 40 years. Yes, I have accounts at other banks, so I have a point of comparison. The bulk of my funds are at B of A. Their customer service is superior as are their range of services. Also, the availability of bank branches makes it easy to work with them.","3699":"I dont completely agree on their political views as a company and where their money goes but overall as a bank they have provided a good service. We have been with them many years and their online bill pay service and app keeps us around. Otherwise I would probably switch to another bank that supports my views more.","2602":"The Bank of America branch in Arvin, CA (pop. about 16,000), is the worst bank I've had the displeasure of dealing with. Since the pandemic, it has been closed almost continuously . The ATM in the bank building is always out of cash. The drive-up ATM always has about 10-12 cars lined-up when it has money in it. I wish this small agriculture town had another bank. The next closest BofA is about 23 miles from Arvin. I'm sure BofA won't see this.","2356":"I Have had a credit card for 16 years with BOA and because I am not using the card -it was canceled -BOA we started with a secured card and Developed credit together and now I\u2019m dropped because it\u2019s for emergencies -many others have extended new offers Of credit in shorter time -during the down turn I supported you by buying stock - I am selling tomorrow -thank but no thanks user be wareWe moved everything to wellsfargo.","3705":"Their customer service is excellent. I especially like the service when I take a problem to the bank. Issues are resolved quickly by friendly staff. They also are willing to resolve technical questions relevant to their apps, which are too complex for me. I have to admire their patience!!","3704":"Since this bank has gotten larger and offer more and different services its customer service has definitely suffered. Drive through is no longer an option now with the pandemic. Less choices are available. Originally to replace drive through they instilled the teller assist which has now been dissolved. The fees for banking with Bank of America has definitely gotten just ridiculous. I have banked with Bank of America before they were even Bank of America. I have banked with other banks as well and Bank of America has definitely fallen on expectations and it\u2019s just sad to say that they are not my favorite bank.","3703":"I feel customer service could be a little more understanding and listen more when there is a problem or something you do not understand instead of giving you phone number after phone number to call to understand why you are having problems with your account and close it without any warning or notice. There could be a courtesy call with an explanation of what was wrong and why.","3702":"My mother is 99 years old who depends on 3 health care aids around the clock at her condo. Her main bank is BOA with various CDS, money market and checking account. Last month her IRA CD matured, but she was not able to speak to a bank representative due to a bad hearing problem. As her son I have POA for her checking account, but not her IRA CD. The money is needed to pay her bills, and BOA wants her to come to the bank with me to release this IRA. I am in San Diego, and can't fly to NJ due to the corona virus. Mom can't leave her condo in NJ. The bank refused to give me their bank power of attorney form as it is their POLICY. ","3701":"To make it short they deactivated my card. I called 3 times on hold for 40 min each time. 3 times they told me my card was good to go. I go to my own bank and it's not active. The third time they tell me wait 15 min. I say, \"Ok wait with me on the line till my card is active.\" She says, \"Oh I'm sorry I can't, but hold on let me check something.\" She acts like she's pressing some keys and Voila! Like magic my card finally works. 15 min no more. Bank of America is pretty unprofessional. Full of bad immoral personnel. They have infants working there. Unethical. I closed my account years ago, cause they are bad. I only wanted to access my online account with them to transfers my funds from edd to my own bank and they gave me hell. Played with my time and money. Locked my account for no reason at all. I hope they rot.","2603":"All I want to say is that they are unethical and do not deserve their name. They are petty. They have very unprofessional reps. They don't care about you as a person.  They are vengeful. And childish. Save your hard earn money at any other bank please.","2604":"This bank cannot be trusted with anything- from the simplest transaction such as stopping a payment, and certainly not something like the PPP loan.  They lied, blocked our application even though they said we qualified, could not find our application....it was a joke.  Their business bankers are the least knowledgeable in the industry- they just \"punt\" to a different department.  Once they get you signed on with a 'deal' on credit- they leave you to twist in the wind and assume you will not leave due to inertia and the effort to do so. Worst institution we have ever dealt with.","2357":"I had a very bad experience today with one of the Bank of America customer service managers. I requested for a waiver of the late fees (I paid late by 6 days ) for the first miss of my payment and they denied. I am a student going thru so much stress and with little money. I went back to another state to get my dorm stuff and got stuck there and couldn't make a payment in time. I spoke to two of the rep and one is a manager located in Montana. She could have very well accepted my request. Now I understand why this bank is being hated so much. A small simple gesture I would have kept my account for life. I feel so sad and bad not only the money but how they responsive to all the situation we are going through. Thanks. RM - NJ","3706":"They've been diligent in monitoring our account, catching any suspicious behavior immediately. Their customer service has been nothing but amazing. So far we've run into no problems and we've been with them for years.","2358":"I like this card and prefer to keep in good status I\u2019m am wanting to keep credit in great status please update as as possible Thanks","3708":"Bank of America is great. I have had many banks in my lifetime but this bank is for real. In person they help w\/ all banking issues. Nothing is ever left unsaid. From teller to managers are always very helpful.","2605":"My son and I have an account with BOA. I have a 17 year old son that I wanted to open an account for asked the BANK MANAGER if I could start his account online? She advised that I could. I went online to set up his account and was unable to do so because my son is 17! I set an appointment for 1:00 to meet with a banker I got there about 1:05 let the teller know that I was there for my appointment she states that the banker that I am meeting with is on lunch! So I ask if I need to see a banker to make deposit to my account and request a new debit card(the card that was mailed to me never arrived). I was told yes. So I then ask the same MANAGER if it was ok that I had a 1:00 appointment and the banker was on lunch until 1:30? She then asked me if I was there at 1? No I was about 5 minutes late but if you are not here at exactly 1 then no appointment? She states there is a 15 minute grace period. So, the banker comes back from lunch I hear the manager tell her what I am trying to do and the manager tells me I can go in. The banker then looks at me and says how can I help you? Me: she didn\u2019t tell you? So then she \u201cconfirms\u201d what I want to do and then says I don\u2019t have a cash drawer. Okayyyyyyyy, why do you need a cash drawer? Well I can\u2019t take cash to deposit you will have to go to the counter for that. I started at the counter why didn\u2019t she say I can take your deposit but you will have to see the banker to get a new card. No respect for my time at all. Came in with cashiers checks was told by the MANAGER that the funds would be available by 9 in the morning.  By 9 in the morning there was an extended hold placed on the cashiers checks! Why is this necessary for a Cashiers check? So i call the branch and speak with the manager that states she will call me back. When she calls me back she states that she confirmed that the cashiers checks were valid but the bank that they came from has not released the funds. So she can\u2019t release the hold. So you verified that the cashiers checks are valid but you won\u2019t release the hold until the other bank gives you the money???? A cashiers check is guaranteed funds you verified that they are valid but I still have to wait 7-10 days? Do not do business with this bank! I have no idea how the bank manager has yet to give me the correct information. Never apologizes nor try to correct her error! I am beyond frustrated and so far I have had an issue with every visit or interaction that I have had!","3707":"A terrible bank. Worst customer service ever and unprofessional. How they Catrine b the name of bank of America\u2019s Failure naming and banking stay away. Stay away tarah and shame bank.","2932":"No customer service for 3 months. Refused to refund my money for damaged items received through online order because it wasn't in the time allotted, meanwhile most banks were closed, couldn't get an appointment in the ones that were open and no one was answering phones. Customer service picked up and hung up repeatedly without answering. Horrible bank. I'm going to************ where I have my business account. They treat you right. ","3710":"I've had BofA for many yrs. Heard good and bad, I messed up big time with over withdrawals, they worked with me and gave me time to get the money back in. They didn't have to. Taught me a lesson. Since then I have walked a tight rope.","3709":"Bank of America is a decent company. We have had a credit card with them in the past. The interest rate was decent and the credit limit was representative to our credit scores and income. We did not like the annual fee and thought it was a little too high. Overall, we were pleased with them.","3711":"Best Bank ever since 2004, I love their customer service and they're always there for us when things go wrong especially like identity theft. Kingwood Texas has great associates and they always ensure they we taken care of when walk in got service.","3632":"Reps are always courteous, knowledgeable, and professional, whenever I call Bank of America, the wait time is minimal and the reps are very well trained and know the answers to my questions. I have been a customer of. Bank of America for over thirty five years. During the time in which I have had an account, the bank\u2019s name has changed more times than I can remember. During all the changes that the bank has gone through, their customer service reps have consistently remained customer oriented.","3713":"The clerks have changing rules depending upon who they're talking to and if the boss can hear them. With our account, my husband could close it without my permission and cash our checks without my signature, but the same woman wouldn't do the same for me.","2359":"So far I have had a great experience with this card. I have had less than a year, but I transferred higher interest rates card to 0% for 18 months.","2606":"I've been fed up with Bank of America for years and I finally just cancelled. Their fees are unnecessary and calling in is a time consuming, frustrating process. I don't feel inclined to write reviews often, but this company really takes the cake when you think about big corporations who don't care about their customers.The fees feel unnecessary - transferring to an external bank account, and stop check for instance. Their automated phone system is horrible. Waiting times, re-routing because they don't know where to place you, call back failed to work, re-authentication of my account number and other verification at every touch point - clearly not transferring info over correctly!Well anyway - after YEARS I'm finally switching back to TD, which I highly recommend if you like modern online banking, friendly customer service and much less and lower fees.","3712":"BoA is the whole package - technologically advanced, secure, excellent customer service, and good bank products. I've been a BoA customer for more than 20 years and have (or have had) almost every kind of financial experience you can have with a bank. Except for a few hurdles with a car loan, they have never let me down.","140":"This credit card has help me boost my credit score and my financial stability. I would like to thank this credit card company for their support and kindness towards me.","3714":"Never enough help even before virus. Hours have now been cut due to virus which I understand, but then they should be available on one and on the phone. They are not when I call. I am on hold for at least 15 minutes.","3715":"I have been with this bank since 1985 and I enjoy all of the services offered. I stayed with them because when I was stationed overseas I was able to use their services wherever I traveled. The bank has services all over the world. So I wanted to be a part of a bank that I felt wouldn\u2019t close down without notice. Even though it\u2019s a large bank, they treat me as though I am the only customer.","3716":"I appreciate the security features even though it can be an inconvenience, it is also protecting your money and how fast you can speak to a representative if problems arise. What I don\u2019t like is the virtual assistant Erica. She has never been able to help me and always refers me to customer service. Useless. All in all I have had had a great experience better than my previous institution.","2607":"This bank is fraud. They are stealing your money and use for their own business. If you challenge them, they reducing your credit score as a kind of revenge. I have proofs about that and I will sue them. Customer services is suck! Just bad persons working in this bank as a worker. 1 star is too much. I don't understand Why US government is being silent about this bank. I want to tell people, change your bank immediately!","3719":"BOA was my top choice of all the banks even if the fund was not in your Account. You had time to put money in the account before they charge you late fees. But nowadays you can't find a bank open to do business and if one is open the lines are soooo long most of the time people will just leave. It's all about online banking problem. You can't get cash online.","3718":"Whether online or in person this bank is efficient. Great security measures. The online service is easy to navigate and very helpful if you have a purchase that doesn't fulfill the required service. Great rewards on purchases, you get to choose.","3717":"I've been with Bank of America since 1978. I opened my first account way back then. Never have I had any bad issues or customer service. I can rely on this bank to answer or help with any questions that arise.","3720":"No issues with banking experience or customer service. There are different types of accounts but the interest rate is not so good. Also the minimum balance option in accounts is not good. No good CD rates.","141":"They have been very helpful with helping me with this account. They have answered any questions I have had and assisted with the COVID 19 pandemic","142":"So far everything is great! I will come back and update in the future. Thanks So far everything is great!

Thanks","2608":"Bank of America in Greenville, TX has to be the worst BOA in the US. Went there to get a cashier's check and was told by Melody that she was unable to do a check for my amount. I had more than enough funds for the check. Then I saw a food delivery man come in with lunch for the bank employees. Melody was didn't want to make the check, she may miss part of her lunch time. There were only about four employees in the bank and a line of people. If the bank can't serve their customers maybe they should close for lunch.","2933":"I've never had a worse customer experience in my life than the one I'm experiencing with Bank of America now. My husband has been a customer since 2005, and we've only once redeemed our points earned through your credit card rewards program. In Nov 2019, we rented a car for our wedding anniversary for the posted amount on your travel rewards site and had a $0 balance remaining. We have documentation that proves that. Five months later, in March 2020, we received a bill saying that we owed BoA $317 more due to what we've now been told is an issue between Expedia, Enterprise and BoA. BoA appears to have posted the wrong amount on the car rental price and is trying to shove the excess bill on us instead of paying Expedia due to BoA's error -- essentially charging us $550 for a 2-day car rental, a price we'd never have agreed to had we known. We've filed complaints repeatedly and called all parties. My husband has been on the phone with BoA intermittently since we received that bill, literally spending DAYS on your customer service line by phone only to have reps pass the buck and transfer him between lines. The reps who have actually been helpful aren't enabled to make refunds on their own and have to refer us to the travel center, who is apparently horrendously incompetent. We were given direct phone lines and email addresses to reach out to, only to find a week later that the phone numbers have been redirected and no one responds to email. Four months after that bill was issued, BofA says they've arranged for Enterprise to refund the amount charged; that was due to be posted within 10 business days. It's now been 16 days and BofA has completely gone silent.\n\nWe have NEVER made a late payment after 15 years of being a customer. As of now, it appears we're going to need to just count our $317 as lost and cancel our card. I have never been so lost as to who to turn to for help within a company. I'm very disheartened to hear this is how BofA treats its customers and will be making sure friends and family know that.\n","143":"Excellent customer service, great APP makes managing finances easy. Cash back values is greatly appreciated. It\u2019s super to get additional cash back on my selected category of online purchases. Thanks!","144":"An honest man went to a Bank of America ATM machine and there was $800 sticking out with the receipt from the previous person who forgot to take it the hottest man went into the Bank of America to return it and the Bank of America says it\u2019s none of their concern this Hass to be one of the worst banks in the country!","146":"Anyone thinking about a loan for anything stay far away from Bank of America!!! You can't get through to them if you have a question, if you do get through they will give you the run around. I can not say enough bad things about them because I would have to write a book.","145":"Thank you for your Business Thank you for your business thank you for your business thank you for your business Thank you for your business","2934":"This has to be the worst bank ever, They allow agents to be verbally abuse to you over the phone and never take accountability that this should never ever happen and they never listen when a customer is clearly trying to explain they had fraud on there account and instead of helping the client they treat them like dirt. RUN FAR AWAY FROM THIS BANK","2609":"I am trying to deposit a check for a friend of mine who has no car...The only access to the back is via the drive through and no appointment is doable...I went already 4 times to Bank of America on Merrimon Ave to deposit the check but there is a 25 cars line ahead of me. I also have to work and has no time to wait for my turn. Every other bank is open to the public if the customer wear a mask. Why not Bank of America ? Are they so special ??So, I have no idea how I can give the check and my handicap friend is still waiting...","3721":"I have been banking with Bank of America since 2007 and I have experienced an extreme decline in the quality of customer service they provide. Last week, my debit card was deactivated without my consent or knowledge. I called customer service to find out what happened. They informed me that my card was reported lost\/stolen. I told them that I did not make such a report (the card was still in my possession) and I would like a replacement sent as soon as possible. The customer service representative assured me that a new card would be sent out.","2610":"I have been banking with Bank of America for over 20 years, and the customer service is usually average to good, but my experience today with Jenae was quite unpleasant. Everytime I leave the country, I exchange money at the bank. I like to do it in person because I like to ask questions about the rates and to make sure my money is correct. I went into the bank today, the new Clairmont location and Jenae was my teller. When I went to do the exchange, the 1st thing she said was, \"Why don't you do it online?\" When I explained that I would prefer a personal experience, she said \"we don't have access\" 1st I thought it was very interesting that NO ONE at the bank had access to order foreign money. When I inquired as to the difference between the previously torn down location (where I have done it in the past) to this new location. She stated \"well, you wouldnt be able to understand unless you work here.\" Now, I have 3 degrees, so I feel like I should be able to wrap my head around what is so different. I later spoke to Angela, who very easily explained the situation, that they have all been displaced from their home banks and their access is linked to their home bank, see not that hard. I felt very belittled by Jenae, and don't care to ever interact with her again, so although I typically prefer Bank of America over Chase, guess where I will be doing business for a while.","3722":"I have had a savings account with Bank of America for the past 11 years. Recently, I have gone to the local BOA and no one is there. Prior to going to the bank, I checked the website and the hours have not changed. I called them and they say they have different hours due to COVID-19 but, do not tell you what the hours are. I tried to set up an appointment and that doesn't work either. As a result, I closed my account 20 June 2020 and was told that I would have a cashiers check within 7-10 business days. It's been a month and a day today and still no cashier's check. I wrote them on 8 July with no response, called them and got different answers to the same question. Today, when I finally reached someone she said, they just finished closing the account 14 July & the check is on the way. Totally unacceptable for any establishment.","3724":"Sitting in line at Bank of America behind eight cars with each car seemingly taking 5 to 10 minutes at the drive-through. Would walk in, but the line of people out the door is excessive. Don\u2019t know why so many branches are closed in the Charleston area, or why you can\u2019t open enough lines to serve your customers. This sucks.","2935":"They have the worst customer service imaginable. I hit a finical rough patch in March and accrued several overdraft fees. I immediately reached out and tried to be proactive with them about getting the fees paid. I deposited my entire tax refund which should have covered the negative amount and somehow still had to pay an additional $400. Once I got my overdraft fees paid, they forced closed my checking account without notification; the downside is I set up 100% of my direct deposit back to that checking account not knowing it no longer existed. \nThe call center for help and they had me hold for almost a hour and still could not help me. I really did like Bank of America I was excited to go back to banking with them, but now an hour and 30 minutes into this call I am cutting all ties. ","147":"I like BoA in overall, except for the fact that it's quite difficult to make a phone call to talk with representatives for adhoc requests.","148":"Cancelled my credit card without cause. So back in 2008 BofA, cancelled one of my two credit cards with them, they said things were too risky. Now during Covid, they canceled the 2nd card, saying again, things were not looking good. I have a 780 credit score with perfect payment history. See a pattern here? When BofA anticipates tough times ahead they prepare to protect themselves from defaults by cutting back the credit they have out there. Remember when a bank said they are there for you....NOT BofA, they are only there when it's good for them. They will leave you high and dry when you need it most. Choose another bank or better... choose a good credit union. Stay away from BofA.","149":"If you think Bank of America has your back in this pandemic; think again! I am a 30 year customer of the bank with an 800 credit score and I own my home free and clear. I just relocated to another state and started a FT job to make sure I would be protected in case the economy bellied up. The treatment I received from the bank while applying for a Home Equity Line of Credit was horrendous!","2611":"Customer service in Bank of America branch locations has always been excellent. A few months ago I moved to a town without a BofA branch and I\u2019m forced to rely on online banking for customer service. Today I spent over an hour unsuccessfully trying to get a simple issue resolved. I gave up getting it resolved online (there is no way to send a simple message on their website or with \u201cErica\u201d on mobile banking) and called their customer service number. I gave my info to the automated system repeatedly and finally got to speak to an associate after 45 minutes. I was transferred 3 times, each time to the wrong department. Some of the associates were rude. I finally just hung up because I don\u2019t need this stress in my life. I am so disappointed in my bank of 25+ years.","3723":"COVID has brought Bank of America (BOA) to stall. I live in Edison, NJ and have three business banking accounts with BOA. No branches operate for Drive-in in my radius of 20 miles, in which BOA has around 12 branches. Getting an appointment for genuine problem is so difficult. You call the bank, minimum wait time 20 min. I am trying to solve the problem last few weeks, and so much time spent but job not done. After banking with the bank for the past more than a decade, I don't know how this is going to be resolved. Very frustrating.","2032":"I have the BOA secured rewards card with them great card so far I also bank here so I wanted to establish a relationship with them since I'll be starting a buisness soon.","2031":"Had this card for over 15 years. It helps NEA, and I really like the cash back rewards. The online system and app work well also.","2030":"This is my third credit card and I just turned 18 yes I am responsible with them credit score already 692 and it\u2019s only been 4 months I absolutely recommend this card my starting credit limit is 500","3725":"We have a small business that rented and sold cars in 2019. The beginning of 2020. We opened a business bank account with BofA in 2020 for that business. Soon after, we had the pandemic shut downs, and the car rental business pretty much stopped. We closed our account, sold our cars and got ready to shut down. Shortly, we found out that we can apply for a SBA disaster assistance loan, and started the process with the SBA. During the application process we were told that we need to reopen our business bank account. After calling Bank of America, we were told that it was too late to reopen our account. Consequently, we spoke with the SBA, and they advised that we can open a new account, which we did over the phone with a telephone banker. In hindsight, I feel that my mistake was to have opened the account over the phone, but due to Covid shut downs, I thought it was only logical. ","2033":"I had a several accounts with Bank of America in good standing. They serviced my mortgage for years. I always paid ahead on my mortgage.A school board decided to condemn my property. I fought against the condemnation. I decided to pay off my mortgage. When asked for a payoff amount, the the balance was about $8000 high.I went to my branch manager to inquire. After a few weeks, it was determined that the school had made multiple inquiries into the mortgage and the fees for the inquiries had accumulated to approximately $8000. For those who have never had property \"taken\" (condemned) it is an unpleasant experience that has very few rights for you, the condemnee. The School, condemnor, is responsible for paying their fees, by law to keep what happened to me and my family from occurring.Bank of America reassigned the branch manager and informed me that I had to pay off the balance to close the mortgage and I should ask the school to return the funds. They refused to address that their charges were against the law. The school declined to return the funds. I have pursued the matter for years. Though we have repeatedly won court cases, and it was proven the School acted in bad faith, the funds remain tied up in the court cases that are continually extended. I can only hope that my heirs might eventually get the refund.I always fear organizations, like Bank of America, that are willing to impose their burdens, illegally, for their profit, at the cost of their customers and that their customers have to fight for their rights. I hope this helps your decision making.","3726":"So I tried to send some money using their Zelle tool. The transaction was held for review. I like that they were protecting me. American Express does the same....but AMEX calls me when something fishy is going on. Bank of America I had to wait on hold for nearly 2 hours to tell them NOT send the money because it took so long that I had to write a check. The person from fraud was so unprofessional that I chewed her out and she hung up on me. I should mention I am a \"Platinum Rewards Member\" which clearly means NOTHING....or possibly the crappy service I received was actually \"good\" compared to a \"Silver\" member. What a crock.","2621":"I think Wells Fargo and Chase are better than Bank Of America as crazy as it sounds. Bank of America have terrible service and are liars. I had an old checking that had a big overdraft in it and the collections department lied and told me 3 days the system will update the payoff in order for me to apply for a new account and yet when 3+ days gone by I kept  applying online and kept getting denied left and right and I called customer service and these liars said I would have to wait 3-6 months to even apply for a new checking account because the payoff on the old checking account has to be updated with Chexsystems, just unbelievable I thought Bank of America was a good bank but they proved to me they are not.","2034":"On July 14th 2020, I opened a new checking and savings account with Bank of America using the online method available on their website. I followed all the instructions and answered all questions truthfully. At the conclusion of the process I was asked to wait while my application was being reviewed for approval. Shortly after a message popped up stating that my new accounts were approved. I was provided a link to download their app to my phone. I downloaded the app, opened it on my phone and logged into my new account. As I reviewed the features I learned that I could deposit checks by taking a picture of them. I decided to use this feature to deposit my last two payroll checks. I followed the instructions and successfully deposited both checks. I then wrote \u201cDeposited\u201d on both checks per the instructions from the app. I was informed there was a hold on the checks which I expected but due to the fact these were payroll checks I was not anticipating the hold period would be more than a couple of days. I logged out of my account.Later I logged back into my account and was told that I am locked out of the account and given an 800 number to call. I called the number and was informed I needed to call back during business hours. I made the second phone call on July 15th and after a lengthy wait was told that my account was reviewed by a second person. This person decided to close my new account for suspicion of identity theft, something like that. I was told my only remedy was to go into an actual Bank of America branch and open a new account to replace my closed new account. I asked about how the banks were operating during the virus crisis and only then was I told that I needed to make an appointment first. No appointments were available that day but I was able to schedule one on the 16th at 1:30pm. Because I have a one hour commute to work, I had to miss three hours of work for which I will not get paid. You see, I had been unemployed the previous 6 months. This was my third week on a new job and I had to ask for time off without pay to make this appointment.I arrived at my appointment, explained my situation, she looked at my account and didn\u2019t know what to do. Her supervisor looked at the screen and told her to call the number on it. She called and was put on hold for quite a while, finally spoke to someone that told her they would transfer her call to the correct department, and put her back on hold again. Finally she spoke to someone and when she hung up she told me the following:-\tShe was going to have to open a new account for me.-\tThe checks I deposited were going to be held until July 22nd.-\tThe only way to get the money I deposited into my original new\/closed account, transferred to the new account she was going to open today was to make another appointment for the 22nd. At this appointment someone would call this other department and verify that I was at the appointment and then my money would be released into my new account..I explained to the lady helping me about the issue of missing work on a new job plus not getting paid for what I missed. I was told there was nothing she could do, it had to be this way, and asked if I wanted the new account? I told her I need my money and I need an account so reluctantly because I don\u2019t have any choice at this point , yes I want a new account. She starts the process and stops to inform me that there will be a $100 charge to open the new account. I told her that they had enough (all except for the $300 in my wallet) of my money and they weren't getting any more. She went back to her supervisor to see how they could waive the fee only to return and tell me that I had to pay it. That was it for me and I sad no I don\u2019t want an account but I do want my money back. How do I get my money? She said that I would be sent a cashier\u2019s check sometime after July 22nd.All I did was attempt to open a new account, in good faith with Bank of America and in return look at the damages I\u2019ve suffered.-\tmy payroll income has been taken from me with no definitive answer as to when Bank of America will return my money.-\tThe new account was going to provide me with the ability to let my employer use direct deposit for my pay. So, even though the first two checks were tied up I would have this week\u2019s pay getting deposited into the account I tried to open. Now, I have to wait until next week to get another check.-\tMissed time at work without pay-\tI will now have a few bills that will not get paid on time. That means late fees for me strictly because Bank of America took my money.-\tExplain this, I was told I had to be at the bank in person on the 22nd to get my money released into a new account. But now, they are just going to send it to me? How does this make any sense at all? It doesn\u2019t, as obviously, in the end, it wasn\u2019t that important after all.-\tAnd finally, the humiliation, lack of respect and absolutely no concern or compassion for me as a human being I was subject to by Bank of America\u2019s treatment is shocking. Not once did anyone enquire about any hardships I might experience as a consequence of their actions. In fact, they wanted another $100, no exceptions, to open an account, which by the way I opened the same account online for free! Through this whole experience I feel the message is clear, \u201cMr. Kaiser you are a small little insignificant person and we are big, bad, Bank of America. We can do whatever we want to you and there is nothing you can do about it. We stole your money and there is nothing you can do about it. We want more of your money so that you can have the privilege of having an account with us and there is nothing you can do about it.\u201d Well, they were wrong about that because I chose not to give then another $100 and I would never do business with an entity that treats people the way I've been treated.","2036":"Completely worthless bank. Could have a relationship for years and out of the blue they decide to close your account with no reason and hold your money until they see fit to return it. Better off just putting money under your mattress then using this scam of a bank.","2035":"So bank of America let me open an online account and I then deposited 1,701.00.an hour later then closed my account and told me to visit my local area branch.i did this an then was told they couldn't give me a account an said they would issues my a cashier's check an be expecting it in the mail in 4-6 days.the 7th day I call back an was told 7-10days.on the 10th day I call an talked to the supervisor an expressed my frustration and then was told it would take 10-15 days to get my check.bank of America are shit.im going in the local branch on the 15th day and causing a scene an demand the issue me a check in person or I'm going to jail.i wouldn't recommend that sorry ass bank to anybody.","3727":"10 days ago in Florida, the 3rd most populous state in The United States, Bank of America closed at least 3 branches in central Florida in one specific area. They micromanaged and inconvenienced the customer or consumer in central Florida by closing at least 3 branches, Oviedo, and two in Winter Springs NOT DUE TO COVID-19! This left the consumer about a 1\/2 drive to Lake Mary to transact bank business for the upscale city of Winter Springs, Florida. This also left customers no way to access their Safety Deposit Boxes and their property, assets and valuables!!! Close your account and bank with another bank who SERVES AND RESPECTS YOU AS A CUSTOMER! BANK OF AMERICA WHY WOULD YOU MICROMANAGE NOT DUE TO COVID-19, the worst event in American health history??? GOOD RIDDANCE!","2936":"Worst bank I have used. I tried to link my checking and HELOC account.  I spent hours trying to talk to online banking dept, and was pushed around between online banking, HELOC and even identity dept.  And I still cannot link my accounts together. All people are nonprofessional. All their problem solving method is to transfer you to another dept, and you are in the loop talking to different people and your issue never got resolved","3728":"I have been a bank customer there for 30 years. The bank want you to use the atm or online banking unless you want to take out a mortgage or set up an investment account. The branches are shut down due to the Covid 19 virus which is ok but then raise atm withdrawal limits! Why do I have to set up an appointment at a branch 10 miles away to get money out of my checking account. Tuesday I spent over 3 hours, drove to an atm 7 times, called the bank 4 times, and after all of that had to use a different banks atm and pay a $61.99 fee to take out $1500. Bank of America said that they would cover the fee. A day later they said that they will NOT COVER THE FEE. Terrible bank that will screw clients and customers out of fees. Some of the employees are nice and many are like sheep or robots reading answer from a script. Go to a credit union as an alternative.","2937":"Bank Of America is the worst bank to put your money in. The representatives are the worst example of experts in their field. I have been waiting since June 26th for a card it is July 15th every time I call here I am getting the run around about ** card and when it is coming. I asked to speak to a Supervisor at least 20 times I have not yet spoke to a manager.

This has happened to 1000s of people in last few months and it has to be criminal...I have leukemia and they stole every cent to my name for no reason ..no money for food, bills or anything...CROOKS.","2938":"I have had the worst experience as a Bank of America customer after 8 years of having them for my bank, being a preferred platinum client. It's been a total nightmare. With no legitimate reason they decided to close me 4 accounts with them! Leaving me with no money, froze the accounts ! The answer to how could they do this, when I opened acc with them I agreed to the terms that they can decide at any time to close my acc . Problem is they will take their closing process for who knows how long, use my money and send me a cashiers check for all that was on the accounts. My question is when?! 2 weeks? Or more.. this is completely unacceptable and inhuman . I'm horrified and very upset. It's outrageous that they can treat their customers like this. They didn't just locked and closed the accounts, I have no access to my history or anything what so ever. No online access or anything. I'm furious, and will take legal action. ","2039":"They're just blah. Anytime you need service, they rarely actually help. Their customer service reps sound like robots reading policies off of a sheet. You get the bare minimum from them. Many better options out there. Once I pay my car loan off through them, I'm closing my account, I just don't need their vanilla banking.","3730":"You cannot reach person via the 800 service. The chat service is idiotic as well, it directs you to \"activate account\" regardless of reason for calling. The website shows open locations however if you drive to the location, the branch is closed. I would rather keep my money in a shoe than deal with these people. Unfortunately I am trying to make a deposit for a client who uses BOA and am forced to try to find an open bank.","1660":"Worst bank ever!!! Horrible customer service! It is very clear that all they care about is money and do NOT care about their customers at all. They don't treat their customers like human beings and are really rude. I was a victim of a scam and they had to close by checking account. The whole time I was on the phone with them, they were treating me like I was some type of criminal and for some reason they sent my cashiers check (with the money that was left in my account) in the mail to an address that I had lived in over 6 years ago. They tried to tell me that was the address they had on file, but I had definitely changed the address on file and been receiving letters from Bank of America at my new and current address. Do not bank with them! They also have bad security features since my credit\/debit card has been hacked multiple times. My family has been a customer for over 20 years and I over 7 years and now, they will definitely not get anymore business from me or anybody from my family. Unbelievable.","1664":"I had a CC with BoA for 18 yrs. Excellent standing. (Paid BoA thousands over the yrs). I was unaware of a small balance ($72) which I immediately paid once I was aware. Being it was over 90 days BoA cancelled my card. Talked to multiple people with customer service, all very nice but nice is not customer service. All said the bank rules are in stone and nothing they can do to get another card. Clearly a business bank run by rules, no latitude for human intervention. All business, no personality. Customer service - no comparison to my local bank and credit union.","1661":"I would give a *0 if possible. Wife was penalized for being responsible. 20 year customer, started with $4k limit, wife worked hard over 20 years to improve credit to just a couple points from perfect and BOA had raised limit to $24k.They just cancelled her account for inactivity with No warning letter, No email, No notice at all. Most companies give a warning letter to allow you make sure it doesnt get cancelled. Now this will affect her credit score she worked years to improve. Debt to income ratio. No help what so ever from customer service. I will be writing bad reviews on BOA often to make sure potential customers see how they penalize their responsible customers and maybe to get customers to drop BOA. Penalized for being responsible is ridiculous, we would have charged thousands to keep that active but no notice, no nothing...... just cancelled. Terrible job BOA, shame on you. I hope you lose many customers from all the reviews your about to receive from us. Don't use BOA. Go to Bank of Oz (great bank). Shame on you Bank of America! Penalizing a 20 year customer for being responsible with their finances.

I have a small family with bills to pay and I have no access to my own money. They said since it was a higher deposit than usual, it is suspicious combined with an online account opening (which is apparently suspicious). I asked if I could have the check returned from the ATM and they denied. They basically said I do not care, figure it out. So I am still waiting for access to my own paycheck. Who knows why eleven days are needed. ","2612":"Called customer service.   Took my over twenty minutes to reach a live agent, but was disconnected before this occurred.Tried again.  After getting through the maze of options, I was told there was a two and a half hour wait.Really?  That's considered customer \"service?\"","2613":"I am very disappointed. I've never had anything like this call with one of Bank of America representatives. Not only my issue hasn't been solved by the representative, but she was also so rude and so unprofessional. I couldn't even believe I was taking to one of the America's largest bank customer service... That lady asked me to wait while obviously was doing something else with all that background noise on her side. Her tone of voice was absolutely unacceptable. The fact that there is no clear place on the bank's website where customers can leave their feedback is even more disappointing.","1665":"You do not update my balance monthly ?Very disappointed in this card my updates and I closed my checking account and my savings account I didn\u2019t like No drive thru and the difficulties making appointments","2940":"This bank does not treat its customers right. Deposited a check that I received from a company that I did some contract work for. Keep in mind that I have deposited multiple checks from this same company as I have an ongoing relationship with them. This is a larger amount than I have previously received but still there is trackable history. BoA decides to place a 7-day hold on my check. Would not even give me the $200 advance. I called customer service and pleaded for options to expedite the release of funds so that I could pay outstanding bills that are coming due and past due. Was offered no solutions and told simply that I have to wait. In the MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC???? When people need access to their funds, this is the best BoA can do? I can maybe understand if I had never deposited a check from this company before but this is my third check from them. Corporations claim to be \"in this together\" with the rest of us - clearly they arent. If there ever was a time to suspend \"standard policy\" this would be it. People are hurting.

For nearly 25 years I have NEVER been late with a payment. Due to some banking mishaps caused by the pandemic, I was late with a $50 payment...the first time, ever. When I wanted to charge the technology persons work, I was denied because of the late payment. Now, this makes me furious. I have borrowed hundreds of money from B of A that they have earned countless funds from that for many years. And the one time I was late I was denied!

Since we did not have complete access to the business checking we decided that 50% would go to his personal account and 50% to my personal account. We were both signers on the loan but when the 50% was deposited in my account it showed his name first, so it grabbed the risk dept attention and I get that , however keep in mind we had already applied for a business checking through BOA we just did not have full access to it. By the time it was approved about 8 days later BOA put a freeze on both of my personal one of which I share with my son who is off to college in another state, now it has been six days more I have no money, food, utilities are turned off because I do not have any cash or any means of getting my money out of my accounts. I have spoke with the fraud dept, I have been to the bank in person, I have sat on hold for hours waiting for services reps. You would think that the bank know when apply for a SBA loan all grounds are covered before the SBA even thinks about releasing any funds to any account. They closed all my accounts and have left me high and dry with no date of a cashier's check being sent out to me, and its been 9 days total. I would plead with anyone to stay far away from BOA they are very unprofessional when it comes to a client.","2617":"This bank is the epitome of a predatory bank. They are in it for themselves.

Over a week later I still haven\u2019t heard from the bank about my application status. I\u2019ve been attempting to call for the past 3 days now and have spent a total of several hours waiting for a customer service rep to pick up but instead keep getting a message that says \u201crepresentatives are experiencing high volumes and are unlikely able to answer your call. Please try again later\u201d and then it just hangs up on me after I\u2019ve been waiting for about an hour. Don\u2019t waste your time with this bank. Go with CHASE or Wells Fargo. Both have much better customer service, lower account fees and minimums, and just as many locations and benefits.","2410":"Best credit card I've ever had an very nice an helpful people when I need help with something,and when I call I get a human not a robot","3732":"My name is Pearl **, yesterday July 6th I called Bank of America to schedule an appointment for notary services.

I asked him a question. He told me that do two or the appointments that I would have to wait an hour. He asked for my Bank of America card and later on he asked for the documents that I wanted notarized.

I have to set an alarm just so I can get on the phone with customer service the second they open. Forget about calling any other time. The bank did not properly vet a scammer that called, pretending to be me and manipulated my account by $1383. Then, they went ahead and are closing both my checking and savings and say they don\u2019t have to have a reason to do so. Fine by me, except they took my entire disability check from Social Security that went towards the negative balance that was their fault in the first place. Today I got a letter saying they were closing my accounts and would no longer accept and direct deposits to my account. This letter was dated June 26. The took in my direct deposit on July 2.

(And as far as I knew, it shouldn't even have been possible, since I cancelled the card!). Now it's Friday night and their CLAIMS department ONLY WORKS ON REGULAR BUSINESS HOURS, so if you get hacked on a weekend, good luck, hackers can charge as much money as they want to your card until Monday when you can finally call BofA.

The branch has two outside ATM's & one has been out of service for over two weeks.  Calling their customer service line results in an indeterminable wait--gave up after 30 minutes.

I would recommend them to a friend.","1821":"Anything outside of normal banking this bank does not perform well on. Overall this bank values what it can get from you not what it can work with you on. I have been with them for 10 years, they put my family through hell on a home loan, they then immediately sold the loan to another company. They promised to get the loan back and never did. Just recently we went to the bank and they \"upgraded our accounts\" told us how much better their CC was than our Capital one, told us we did not need the Capital one anymore. This cost us 160 points in our credit scores. They to apply for an auto loan to be denied, I asked the rep if i could just take a loan out against my savings account. Escalated the situation to corporate and the answer i received was this bank does not do loans, its all automated. Denied that they will do anything to make it right.

I never use it because of the death grip it has on my credit.","1824":"If I could give less of stars I so would.

They take 120 minutes before you might get a rep on the phone. They are clueless as to what your issue is. The physical bank is relatively clueless as well.

He decided that it was easier to just go straight to the Bank of America to cash it then turn around and deposit it into our own account at another bank. And since that is who Mass Mutual banks with and where it was issued from, it should be a pretty straight forward transaction. NOPE. NOT EVEN CLOSE. The bank employee pretty much gave him the run-around and said that there was nothing that he could do for him since he was not an account holder with them. But that he could use the check as a deposit in order to open up an account. All that the teller had to do was go on his computer to verify that the funds were in Mass Mutual's account then issue him a cashier's check for remaining total (minus check cashing and cashier's check fees). So bottom line was this: if you are not an account holder at BOA, they will not cash a check for you even if the check issuer is a BOA account holder BUT if you open an account with them then they will go through the motions of verifying funds for the check. \nAs for the check, we went to our own bank and had no problems. Our banking teller called BOA and verified that funds were available, deposited the check into our account, issued us a portion of it up front and the rest would be available the next business day. \nBOA has horrible customer service!

They also didn't approve my application for $5000 under the PPP, even though I had 2 qualifying accounts with them, and as we all see now they only helped bail out larger companies in order to receive bigger interest paid from government.

First I did not have the right number, second that payoff amount was just an estimate or that I must have been caught in the billing cycle etc. They would not under any circumstances remove this extra charge from my account. I heard that they were sorry I was frustrated, and a plethora of other horrible platitudes. I would highly recommend considering any other company but bank of America.

Lots of apologies, but no one ever actually got anything done. When we got to the point of making a payment, Bank of America did not credit the payment to the right place and we were sent to collections. When we tried to demonstrate that we had in fact made the payment, they started telling us again that we are not on the account.

Reading all of the other disgusted customer reviews only confirms the suspicion that BoA seems to operate by giving their customers the same treatment.I purchased a flight\/hotel bundle with Expedia back in January, and I made sure to buy the vacation cancellation waiver along with it. When Covid really hit the U.S. hard in early March, I decided to use it to cancel my trip. After many headache-inducing hours on Expedia's virtual chat, I was able to get the entire refund applied minus the $70 cancellation waiver. The hotel refund processed right away. But getting my flight tickets from Alaska Airlines refunded was more cumbersome. I contacted BoA for support and they recommended that I send in a written explanation of the issue along with whatever documentation of the purchase to convince them that I was due a refund. This seemed like an inefficient and antiquated way of handling what seemed a routine customer service issue, but I complied because I wasn't paying for a trip that I didn't take! I submitted a 10-page application with all the required documentation and 6 weeks later, I finally received a refund. Case closed, I thought at the time! With everything else happening in life, not being out almost $800 seemed like a big relief.Yet five weeks later, I checked my online BoA account to see that the full amount for the flight tickets appeared back in my account again, inexplicably. I figured another phone call or two might readily fix the problem. Clearly, I underestimated BoA's ineptitude and unwillingness to help its customers. Like many others, I spent hours on the phone, being transferred from one department to another. I was cycled through Jasmine, Amber, Randy, Manar, and Shontae. I explained my situation to each person, but was then either placed on hold, hung up on, or transferred to another person in the wrong department. No one could help.Later today I got a letter from BoA telling me that they \"could not further investigate my claim.\" The letter did include a mention of consumer protections, but that was empty lip service. Whomever took a cursory glance over my claim did me the favor of taking a screenshot of Alaska\u2019s refund policies, which I had already read and reviewed. Yes, you can apply a vacation waiver to nonrefundable tickets purchased on Expedia, per Kristian, an Expedia customer service rep who helped process my refund.Realizing that BoA would be of no help, I contacted Alaska Airlines. After explaining the situation to Barry in the refunds department, he advocated on my behalf with the claims department at Alaska and informed me that they would refund the full flight amount back to my BoA card. Incredible. 20 minutes on the phone with one person who works for the vendor requesting payment got me more \"consumer protection\" than 3 hours, a half a dozen people on the phone, and 10-pages of written documentation for BoA. The second the charge is credited back to my account I fully plan to pay off the remaining balance and bid BoA farewell permanently. Credit score be damned. This is not how you treat your customers.","2949":"Sent auto title with no tracking, naturally it is missing and they won't take responsibility.

Thought it was a person doing this, but when it happened to my dad at the same date and time ... and then other people from around the area you tend to try and investigate on your own and tend to come to your conclusion. Nevertheless, how they handle such a scandal is why they deserve as many negative stars as possible. I waited 8 hours the first day trying to claim my money , waited the whole day and they didn\u2019t answer. A little discouraging but I had the whole next day. So there I was ... waiting another 7 hours and when I was about to hit the 8th hour they finally answered. For security reasons they canceled my card and sent me another one but they didn\u2019t send the card immediately or even the next day.. 4 days later I receive an email that they barely sent the card and to wait 7-10 business days for the card. All this happened on the days of may 29 through 30 and I had to pay rent on the 1st and I can\u2019t access my money, when going personally to any local Bank of America they say that they are separate from EDD and that I should call EDD instead because they can\u2019t help me.. so I go ahead and call them and guess what i waited another 8 hours and no answer . So here I am ... needing to pay bills , waiting for a card that is already 5 days late , no one is answering or picking up the phone or avoiding to help me when I bring up the situation .. so now I\u2019m legit asking , how can you call yourself a bank ? How can you do this to people actually get away with this ? Forget rating this bank bad ... this is basically criminal, how inconvenient are you trying to be to the people ?","1281":"I have been a Bank of America customer business and Personel for over thirty years and I am ready for to cut loose for many reasonThere is no personal attention nor common senseToday I needed a certified check and was told I need to pay for that my account was not set up to receive free check I have never been charge for this at my local branch and was told\u201c you want it or you don\u2019t\u201d.

I wanted to setup auto bill pay on their website which I did.  Since I am not a Bank Of America checking customer any payment that I make over the payment amount is NOT applied as a curtailment.  The customer service representative stated that any overage payment I made went towards next months payment and principal.  Seems like a conflict of interest or just unethical to only accept curtailment payments from Bank of America customers.  To be fair, they did offer to mail out a paper request to return a check to setup an extra payment for principal however...** wife and I have separate checking accounts and her name is on the auto loan so they won't accept this from ** checking account.  So...I guess Bank of America will be getting good old pen and paper every month in the form of a paper check with ink since they refuse to accept non-curtailment payments from non-Bank Of America customers.\n\nAhhhhh....now I remember the Bank of America \"ways\".  Sounds like they are just smarter now.  No worries, I won't be signing up for a BOM checking account.  I might actually refinance this auto loan through 5\/3.  Just silly, really....just sillly.

We even had a 3-way call with Chase to verify the payment.  I have the trace #, time it went through, amount, account # etc.  Chase verified it was all correct.After a 6th call with a BOA banker, she said that on the date of my payment there was a major system error.

The rental car I booked was from Thriffy for the rental of a car in Calf. The stated price was in US dollars, RentalCars.com web site states on the first page \"No hidden charges or Credit Card fees.\" When a car is booked to rent on the web site by Book it Now it states \"No card fees.\"Bank Of America says the transaction was made in a foreign country that is why I was charged a foreign transaction fee. They say I have to ask where the transaction is completed. I did that and Rentalcars.com web site states no fees and when Book it Now pops up it states \"No Fees.\" Bank Of America tells me that they can't tell what country the transaction was completed in so how am I. How many millions do you think Bank of America makes on this scam? They abolutely refuse to refund the charges. I understand if I am in a foreign country these fees apply but not in this case. I never left the US and everything was booked in US dollars. Stay away from Bank of America.","2951":"This bank is horrible.

As one of those small business owners, we are moving our accounts from BOA and recommend that all small business owners do so. Your commercial isn\u2019t changing your company image.

I finally was able to find a job after all this craziness at a pharmacy. He paid me by check and I went to deposit it but the branch was closed due to COVID-19 so I used an ATM and I deposited it. On the atm machine when I entered the check it said it will be available tomorrow(Keep in mind I had to pay rent on the first) then the next day I log into my bank account it says the check is on hold until the 11th next thursday. I called my boss to see if he can call chase to ask if the funds where released. My boss said \"I have never had any checks being returned and that's how I pay all of my emplooyees and never have an issue.

Chase said \"We are not sure why bank of america is telling you guys the funds are not there when the funds where released to them two days ago.\". I called bank of america again, the lady that I spoke to said \"yes the money was released from chase but it only gives me this information when I check which is - the check is on local hold. Chase is not stopping or reporting fraud on the check so the check is fine. But it's still on hold.\" which I don't even know what that means.

Bank Of America will only scam you and I'm begging you to not open a bank account with them and look somewhere else. I'm waiting for this check to clear and I'm going to do the same. Do not support a bank that doesn't work for the people and the community. I will make sure to file a complaint everywhere against bank of america because them being scammers is very clear to me now.

Banks are security crazy and they are abusing me in two ways. it is expensive to call from Nice, France because they put you on hold for long periods of time.

She never picks up her phone, in a weird way her phone calls go straight to voicemail and after speaking with her for abut 10 minutes, her report states she could not contact me, wow why would Bank of America employ a liar or is she working on company's policy of fraud? I am so mad and will keep fighting this, CFPB could not do much.","481":"Very useful. Get rewards if I use it a lot. Gives me warnings when payments are due. Accepting at many places. Is my reliable card on which I depend.","2957":"Stand by to support. Are you joking? This is the worst banking establishment that I have ever dealt with and I want everyone to know. In the middle of a pandemic Bank of America closed my 2 accounts and froze my funds while they investigate suspicious transactions.  8 transactions in 1 day raised a red flag? There were 8 deposits from unemployment in 8 day. Unemployment finally went through and bank of America thinks it's fraud. Are you kidding  me. I have been with boa for over 15 years and 6 accounts. This is how I get treated. And now they say it could take 60 days while the investigate the suspicious activity and they will mail me my funds when they are done their investigation.  In the middle of pandemic.  This is rediculious. And they say they have every right to close an account at any time.","482":"Even though you have to a credit score of at least 700 I was able to get the card without my score being established yet compared to not getting a lower tiered card. This card has been my daily driver for purchasing most stuff or paying bills. Just doing what ever it takes to rack up the points.","483":"One star is still to high for BOA. They have financial ruined my family for the last 10 years with their lies, and deception. There is not enough space to write my dismay with them and there strangle hold of keeping my mortgage at 6.25% for over 10yrs. They made it completely impossible to seek a mortgage from anyone else because of how much they ruined our credit and will not refinance after after our remod 5yrs ago left us with same interest rate same term and 700 more a month to pay. I get pad byweekly and one check alone does not pay the mortgage. Leaving us on average 11\/2 months behind to almost 2 months staying alive. Terrible mortgage company and practices","484":"VP Judith Johnson was on the customer floor making sure all the customers needs were met. While a teller was checking my account for errors, Ms. Johnson identified that I had the wrong type of checking account for my needs. She corrected the error and returned my checking account dues for 1 year. I thought that was amazing that she went out of her way for me. I saved over $300.","2642":"I would rather call the DMV or IRS than call Bank of America.  Their customer service is the worst... long hold times, multiple transfers after your call is answered, and absolutely zero accountability or ownership on the part of the agents who \"answer\" these calls (I wanted to write \"service theses calls\", but that is not what they do.).  Additionally, their mobile app is just terrible.  There is too much emphasis on marketing other products rather than providing a nice UX and easy way to accomplish banking tasks.  Bank of America is easily one of the worst companies for customer experience.  I am convinced it is their strategy, because I avoid calling or contact customer service; I know it will just ruin my day,  I use them for banking because they are big, but I would never get a loan from them or put my retirement savings with Merrill Lynch.  They must train their staff to hate customers, because that is how you feel if you need to talk to them.","2644":"It accepts the transaction even though I put the wrong CVV number and then they charge me a foreign transaction fee. I don't want to use the BOA credit card I supposed to use other but since it was saved on my amazon website by mistake I select it but at the next step, it asks me for the CVV number which I put the wrong one it means it belonged to my another bank credit card but still it accept by the BOA and they charged me a foreign transaction fee. where is the security ??","3747":"I made a deposit using the app to deposit by picture. Unknown to me they issue a hold when you use this for the first time. So I checked to see if it posted on 5\/27\/20 which it had not so I checked the issuing bank which I have vision of since it's my Moms account and I found that the check had posted to the issuing account on 5\/26 which I found Odd since the issuing bank is Morgan Stanley who is owned by B of A so I made a call to customer service. The customer service agent was not helpful and in fact was speaking over me which I found extremely dissatisfying and not only that, When the agent told me the funds were being held until 6\/4\/20 I then asked \"Where is the money at this point as it cleared the morgan stanley account on 5\/26 and yet you are telling me I can't access the funds until 6\/4 where is the money now?\" Which that question was never answered so I asked for a supervisor. ","2643":"Unfortunately I cant give 0 stars. I have had my account since 1993, never really any big issues till may 11th 2020. I get a notification on my app I'm at a -888,888.00 balance. When I call the bank I'm told the bank did it for security risk so no one including me can touch the account. Turns out its frozen and due to be closed due to possible check fraud. Come to find out a favor I did for a so called friend turned out to be a bad check. It was never cashed it was returned and I got a 12.00 fee for returned check. I have been told so many lies by over 10 different employees i have spoken to since may 11th till today may 27th. My Bill's that are debited out of my account are gonna go through, that was a lie. Call in 3 days and will have an answer, that's was a lie. Request was put in to get my money sent to me that I have in my account, that was a lie. They say they make a note on my account everytime I call, that was a lie. It keeps going on and on. My Bill's are hounding me and late fees are adding up. When I ask I'm sure late fees will not be paid by bank of America cause they the ones that froze my account and that's the only truth I get is that they are not responsible for my late fees. I was also told it could take 3 months to resolve the issue. When I asked can anyone call the investigator on my case and they response was there isn't a number it's a group of analyst reviewing my account. So if there is an emergency for example a fire they dont have a phone to call 911 there are just gonna sit there. Bank of America is full of it. When I asked so being a customer since 1993 doesn't mean anything no credit or nothing, all I get is dead silence and then the same crap again that my account is being investigated. What would they do if it happened to them are they not going to go out of their way to resolve their issue or just sit back and listen to the different lies being told by the bank....","3748":"This bank is the worst bank I have ever dealt within my 55 years of life. Are these people hired from grammar school. Why do they transfer you around every time they cant solve my problem of opening my account so I have access to my Unemployment. I spent over a hour being transferred to all different people to be told they couldnt open my account and that I have to go to my local bank? These people are a bunch of clowns and should not be dealing with people's money. This bank needs to retrain their employees because they take SUCK to a whole new level.","485":"They try to charge me $5 to replace my debit card that\u2019s not working and my card keeps getting declined everywhere when I have the funds available in my account.","3749":"????

How else were we supposed to survive it is our money NOT YOURS!","2958":"I had to choose a star to be able to make remarks and I had no other choice. In 2014 Bank of America decided to close down one of its offices in Westlake Village CA. ***They were supposed to give us incentives for closing down the operation but they did not*** Instead Corporate Bank if America sold us to their vendor and Corporate Bank of America pocketed our incentives. People with 15+ years of work experience were let go without any remorse. Their excuse was that at least you have a job.  We were left with no choice but to take the job and we did not know what to expect.  When you get hire by Bank of America, they proudly say that you will get incentives if Something happens to you position, but they can easily take it away from you without any explanation. I have no loyalty to that Bank anymore.","3750":"Hi.

I have been a loyal customer since 2010 and believe me I have always been satisfied with their services. However, the bank is failing at properly serving its customers during this public health crisis. Since 8 am this morning, I have been trying to resolve an issue. I was transferred to one agent to another and still nothing. The last call I made around 2 pm was useless because I stayed on the phone for over an hour and no agent came through. So I am beyond disappointed and really thinking about switching bank (literally transferring all my fund elsewhere). It's really in moments of crisis that one can really judge an organization! If people are still working from home, then what is stopping an agent in picking up the damn phone!!!! How hard is that??? If I cannot trust you with my finances in time of crisis, then I'm sorry we cannot do business together. You are failing your customers right now!","489":"Excellent....

Never do a balance transfer from BOA if you are a great client let the people who are irresponsible do the business with BOA so they will have bad loans and go out of business.

All other banks have a drive thru.  They don't seem to care about customers either otherwise they would have the drive thru open.  Another reason is with the population aging why would they stop using the drive thru.

That is exactly how the world works! What grocery store, bank, etc., denies a handicapped elder, with weak balance who has trouble walking, and has to carry a cane, just to keep from falling down?? I went to speak with a manager and the manager said she was sorry and that she would speak with the security guard. Which was a good start.

To top it all off when I told the BOA rep that I wanted to record call for my records, he hung up after their recorder message said that BOA might record the call.

The fees at BOA are higher than many other institutions, but we chose them as we assume they had all the systems and expertise we would even need. We submitted a Paycheck Protection Program loan application that sat in their queue for longer than the funding lasted, two and a half weeks. All of our information was correct but never made it to the SBA. Later they confirmed that yes our application was fine, but sorry the SBA isn't accepting applications. If they couldn't process my application, they should not have accepted it. That is what many small banks are doing. BOA damaged the prospects of my firm and didn't represent us at all when it matter most. Any bank can service us when things are great. When things go wrong, that is when having a Bank work with you is most important. My recommendation is to find a smaller local bank where you can talk to the principles as need arises. At Bank of America, you can barely get time with their front line people in times of need, and you have zero chance of speaking to someone more senior. We will be closing our accounts with Bank of America once we get passed this mess. I would not be investing in BOA at this point as I know others feel similarly disappointed and disgusted with them.","2150":"The card is fine as a back up. Please send a second card please.

So another hour and a half on the phone and I finally get to the right department to let them know that on my claims I have the two checks.  Their response \"Yes I do see here that two cashiers checks were sent and you should discard those\".  When asked why I was told there were no funds in the account and why I was not told to expect these during my initial complaint, I was told it is our Policy.   YOUR POLICY!!!   It is bordering on illegal activity.  Why would you not tell someone that they would get cashiers checks from the bank to discard them on the initial call.  I am already suspicious as you allowed an account to be opened that was not me and now you are not forthcoming with the information on what I could receive from your company!  To me, Bank of America is nothing but a con artist!!  You have had legal actions against you in the past for allowing fraudulent accounts to be opened without authorization.  And it seems to me it is happening again.  I am now being told I need to fill out information to prove this was not me opening the accounts.  WORST customer service out there!!

I\u2019d never use boa or recommend them to anyone. There\u2019s banks that don\u2019t have so many darn fees. Every since I started using NF, I actually have a savings account!

I'm an older technologically challenged computer skills. I know several business associates who have received their funding, all but 1 of them who applied on a later date than I, and ALL through smaller banking institutions that had REAL LIVE PEOPLE they were able to talk to. The greatest frustration is the inability to speak with ANYONE who can tell me anything except ,\"be patient, you will be notified at a later date.\" It sounds like the size of BofA & the number of requests overwhelmed them and their ability to process loan apps as quickly and efficiently as smaller lenders. I have been with BofA for 47 years, way before they were BofA, or Nations Bank, or C&S, or whoever they were before that. I've had issues over the years with them, but all overcomable, & I'm reluctant to change. Even though other institutions have spoken to me about why I should move over to them, I've stuck with BofA, mainly because of the number of branches they have to make it easier for my employees. Their 'non-personal' approach and lack of response to my many calls & emails for help CONCERNING THIS MATTER has left a very sour taste that will certainly result in switching to develop a banking relationship elsewhere after this mess is over, if not sooner. I'm open to recommendations.","2401":"Why are you doing this then Bank of America?\"But big banks have pledged that the money from the relief checks will not go toward negative balances or bank overdraft fees.

They are the best in taking your phone calls after waiting for hours just to tell you, \"We can't help you at all.\" You must just wait for an email from them. But it never comes.

I spoke with B****** from customer care which i wasnt able to refund the 40 dollars i then spoke with Jaime (manager) from South Carolina customer care who wasnt able to do anything either. What i find crazy about all of this is that other banks and companies are able to waive fees and return customers money back, however Bank of America is 1 of top banks and they cant waive a simple 40 dollars fee and return my money back this is just mind blowing to me. I told them im unemployed mother of 3 and that i cant afford to just hand out 40 dollars and they still wasnt able to do anything.

The program ran out of money In two weeks before they even reviewed my application.  I had applied the very morning the program was open to enroll. They are not loyal to their small businesses, and seem to only care about the big money corporations. Final straw after giving them my loyalty for so long.

He was not honest person as delivered a information about payment because he was trying to hide the real amount.

We never really paid attention to this account because there wasn't a ton in it. It wasn't until 6 months ago I realize they have been charging him $5 a month for years - we figure close to $350. I called the 1-800 number I was told they would refund the fees if I went to the branch where I set it up.I go into the branch and they informed me they can do two months. That is fine, I asked just don't charge him anymore. I was dumbfounded to see they charged him again another $5 a week after I went in. He is a child this is supposed to be a free account.

I recently contacted Bank of America to confirm that my two (2) credit card accounts would be subject to payment suspension during the pendency of the Coronavirus crisis. Bank of America initially confirmed that both of my credit cards would be subject to payment suspension and that neither account would accrue interest until May 2020. In fact, when I spoke with the representative from Bank of America in March 2020, she reversed a recently accrued interest charge on one of my credit accounts.\n\nToday, I received an update on one of my credit accounts with Bank of America indicating that I had been charged interest on my pending balance. I immediately called Bank of America to have the charge reversed, believing that the interest accrual had been a mistake. When I spoke with Bank of America, they indicated that although my payments would be suspended until May 2020, my accounts would still accrue interest in any unpaid balances. This is obviously not what I had been told or agreed to in March, nor is it consistent with what the federal government has ordered. Bank of America would only offer to waive late payment fees (despite the fact that I make my credit card payments timely every month and have for years). The representatives from Bank of America also advised me this morning that it is \"not yet their policy\" to waive interest on credit card accounts, despite the fact that the federal government has ordered it to be so.","3768":"Not allowing self-employed\/1099.

Which then affected my\nCredit twice because of the delinquency and then the fact that my balance percentage was raised. I spoke to several managers who claimed that their manager was a computer! They actually claimed they couldn't change anything because it was already it the computer and the computer can't approve the change even though it was their error. I requested our recorded phone conversations as well as the original with the guy that cancelled my automatic payment which was denied of course.

A single large transaction (recurring bill) was placed days after 3 ~$10 charges IN REALITY, yet it appeared as if I made the large transaction and then kept making smaller ones with a negative balance on their system.\n\nHow very lucrative for BoFA!

During these times we need you the most BofA, don\u2019t make it hard on your customers that have been with you for more then 30 years! It\u2019s not all about profits! To make the story short I went with another bank to process my ppp. And to find out on Monday that BofA changed its rules because of all the blowback from its customers, why couldn\u2019t BofA help from the beginning? Really second guessing BofA!","1474":"Bank of America is no longer a great bank. I've been trying to get through to customer service and I've been on hold for over an hour and a half.

They didn't notify me and said they do not owe me a reasoning for closing them. I couldn't believe it! If the account was hacked they could have told me but all they said was it was due to \"risky behavior\" which I have NO idea what \"risky behavior\" they're talking about! I took out all the money from the account and transferred my money elsewhere. I couldn't believe our relationship had to end this way and I am so appalled even during the crisis they acted this way. What a way to protect your customers!","2983":"I will be closing my bank of america account as soon as possible. The bank restricted use of my card due to \"suspicious activity\" and as such, I am unable to pay bills, or but goods in the midst of a pandemic. Furthermore, all attempts at getting a representative on the phone have been unsuccessful as I sat on hold for literally 2 hours. So days have passed and I have no funds. Im closing my account and I will deal in cash from now on. ","2984":"Hello,\n\nI applied for accounts online because I had been sick and needed a way for family to send me money for my bills. I answered the security questions and then transferred $25.00 to a checking account. On Saturday I tried to access my account online via the app and was told my account was locked. Then the next day I received a debit card and tried to activate it but the automated system said there was no account found. This whole time I couldn't contact BOA because they're not opened on the weekends so I had to wait until Monday. Once I contact them on Monday, April 6th, I was informed by a CSR the accounts had been closed because they could not verify information. I asked about the money and he said it was sent out via check on April 1st. No one contacted me from BOA to verify information or to inform me my account had been closed and a check had been sent. Then I asked the CSR how do I file a complaint to which he replied to me that he didn't know how to. I had to have him escalate me to a supervisor to file a complaint to which she didn't apologize or show any form of empathy for the situation I was in. Just silence and typing then asked me if there was anything else. That's it! This is so irresponsible of BOA to just close accounts without informing people. I had already completed the online verification worth credit questions but I guess that wasn't enough. I will never bank with this institution and will be spreading my story all over social media. You guys aren't customer oriented in the least bit. I choose to leave this review on this branch of BOA because they're the closets branch to me. I never got the chance to go in one.

We ALSO NEED a pre-existing business line of credit with them, in order to qualify to apply for the PPP loan. \n\nWe have never had a need for a business line of credit, so never opened one of these accounts with them. Now, in time of need, we cannot even count on our bank, that we have been loyal to all these years, to help us apply for the PPP loan, simply because we never previously had a need for a business line of credit?\n\nWhat are we left to do here? We are in dire need of this loan, as our business and personal livelihood is now in immediate jeopardy. \n\nOut of desperation, we immediately contacted other major banks such as Chase Bank and CitiBank to find out if we can apply with them, hoping that since we have personal credit  lines with them we could somehow qualify, BUT were told that because we do not have a business checking account with them we do not qualify. \n\nThese other banks, such as***************** have basic requirements to apply for this PPP loans- a business checking account would suffice.\n\n It just so happens to be that we do seemingly wrongfully chose to our long-time banking with Bank of America, that has more stringent criteria to apply, in this time of need!\n\nIt is a government loan, simply funded through BofA, it should be unlawful this bank put such requirements, to apply for it. \n\nIn reading other reviews, it looks like many of us are dealing with the same issue here. We need to stand together and voice our concerns. All, please contact Governor Newsom's office website, White House website and\/or local media websites via contact us forms to express your concerns. Let's make this a problem enough, to produce change!\n\nThese requirements MUST  change, before many business owners, banking with this unethical bank, go under.\n","2697":"My company employs over 60 people and has been a customer with BofA since 2003.  We have never required assistance, have had a positive bank balance, and have never carried any debt.  However, when we tried to file for the COVID 19 payroll protection program to ensure we can avoid having to layoff or furlough hard-working people, BofA summarily denied our request stating we have no previous debt history (we have never had to take a loan).  So, what are we to think?  Does the government approve of a bank who prioritizes customers who have a direct debt risk to BofA ahead of those customers who have stable companies and have the ability to maintain their employees in a time of need?  It seems BofA has one interest which is to protect the balance sheet of Bank of America by directing government funds to those companies who carry a loan risk with BofA.  This kind of selfish behavior needs to be eradicated.  I invite all small business customers to boycott this firm as mine will and can only hope the government investigates their abusive manipulation of a well-meaning  program.","122":"So in 2008 when ordinary Americans bail out the big boys, with no strings attached they greedily took our money only to not lend it out but rather hoard it. Now fast forward to today, and BofA will NOT accept you for the PPP program if you don't have a banking AND lending product with them! It seems like they want strings attached to them just handing out our money (which it is in the grand scheme of things). Worst bank EVER!

I haven't got an email, phone call or anything telling me this and wouldn't have known if I hadn't logged in. If I have this much trouble getting a loan, then I can't imagine they give out any of them. As Julia Roberts would say in Pretty Woman, \"Big mistake....HUGE!!!\" I have 700K in money market accounts at a different bank and they are happy to do a HELOC for me with no hassle. Geez. I will never give another second of my time to BOA. Now there is a ding on my flawless credit and they didn't bother to approve or deny my application...they've just stopped processing it because I took a week to get them a P&L statement from my accountant during tax season. Ridiculous!","1591":"I've had this card for about 12 years & this card has no credit increases and a non negotiable annual fee. Please do not sign up for this card you will regret it.","2990":"I've been a loyal customer with Bank of America for over 13 years and today was the first time I called to ask for a reimbursement for a late fee. Customer service was a joke. I waited on hold for over an hour and when I finally reached a representative I explained to him that a glitch in their app caused their bill pay notification they send me every month to stop working. I pay my bills every month and this is how they treat a loyal customer? The representative didn't seem to take my concern seriously. He kept saying the reimbursement was approved and then later in the middle of our conversation on how to fix the glitch on the app he conviently comes up with \"the system gave him an error and he won't be able to provide that reimbursement fee after all\". How in the heck are you going to tell me it's approved and then all of a sudden the system is not allowing you. After a bunch of back and forth nonsense I requested to speak to a supervisor and yet again she conveniently comes up with the same excuse and she suggests that I call back tomorrow, waste another our of my life, to deal with another incompetent representative to tell me the same bull **** .  If this so called \"error\" was genuine then why not offer another solution if they actually value their customers... like idk maybe a call back as to when their system will allow the reimbursement to go through. I dont know just spit balling ideas here. I want my reimbursement back. I believe it's only justified as a one time courtesy that I'm allowed this dang reimbursement fee!","2705":"Thank you to all the staff in this difficult time.

Would be nice to see a higher limit. Most cards do that for you anyway.","2706":"I\u2019ve been with the BOA family since 1999 but the last few days I wasn\u2019t treated like family at all. On 3\/19\/2020 I was a victim of fraud and my account was compromised by someone that I thought was a reputable Company offering me a loan during these troubled times that America is going through. Instead of getting a loan I had all the money I had in the bank stolen and sent out through Zelle and sent to a person that I have no idea of whom they are. I was informed of the fraud by the BOA risk team as they were informing me that they have decided to no longer do business with me. What exactly did I do wrong???? I\u2019m not only in shock by what just happened with the theft of all the money I have at this point but also in how I was treated as a criminal by the bank I\u2019ve been with and been faithful to for years. The next day I call to try and get a resolution when I was told to go into the local bank that I set up the account in so no real help through the hours I was on the phone. I go to the local branch here in Killeen, TX where I reside and although everyone there was super nice and concerned were not able to help me either. I was basically told that my accounts were being shut down and the money that was remaining in the accounts had been frozen. I have ONLY $8.00 to my name and no assistant to get anymore money and I was told there was nothing that could be done. Why would a Bank that I\u2019ve been with for this many years do me like this in my time of serious need???? I literally have nothing at this point. Then I had just gotten paid and they won\u2019t even give me that money. Everything in there bank was mines and I\u2019m the one that worked hard for it and I\u2019m not allowed to have it??? I\u2019m mortified with how I was treated while going through this hardship. Then I was told there may not even be a resolution for possibly 10 days or more. The coronavirus is going around and there is nowhere I can just go into to eat or find things that I need in order to sustain, I have no access to any debit cards to order food or supplies in and to make it worse I am out here with no money!!!! I Haven\u2019t cried So much in my life as I have the last three days. It feels like my whole life and self-awareness has been taken away from me in just a few days. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll ever want to put my money that I work hard for Monday thru Friday again in any bank. How can you not let a person have access to money that is there\u2019s especially at a time like this??? Where is your heart and humanity??? I would never recommend Bank of America to anyone because they don\u2019t care about their customers !!!!","1594":"I had a balance transfer offer which was at 0% rate for about a year. So I took advantage of the offer. I never really use this card but I decided to charge my auto insurance on it and get some Amtrak points. However when I got my bill I was surprised to see they charged interest on the charge for the auto insurance even though I paid it off when I got the statement. I called customer service to see why and she told me that because I made a purchase it calculate interest from the date of purchase. That means if you have a promotional rate DON'T USE YOUR CARD or you will be whacked with a finance charge!!!! This card is being filed away and won't be used again until next year. Not sure why BofA would want customer not to use their credit card, but I'm sure Chase will be happy I'm now using my Sapphire card.","2991":"Horrible account details.

My account balance reflected those \u201cfake\u201d funds that had been deposited into my account. I made the payments thinking that I had funds in my account, later on I saw that my account had been highly overdrawn. Not only did I lose all my money but now I also owe extra money to the bank for the transactions that I had done without having the actual balance for them. On asking the bank that why those funds had been credited to me without verifying that the checks were original, they told me that because you have been our customer for sometime so that was why we credited those funds to you before collecting the funds from the recipient bank.","3781":"I\u2019ve had my mortgage with BOA for 20 years.

When will the 30 mins end?","2992":"So this ordeal is currently ongoing. \nA month back I got a call from BoFa saying my Old Debit Card was compromised by the site I was using (No name of site provided), and I have to get a New Debit Card. I told the gentleman, I do not need a new Debit Card, but he insisted since its compromised we have to replace it, even though there were no fraudulent transactions, or the current card will stop working after Mid - Feb.\nI reluctantly had no choice. \nCometh, Mid - Mar, someone siphoned around $2900 from the new card. I was like... What on Earth.\nI called the bank. The transactions were in Processing... Still I was told, I have to wait for 90 days. Then my regular payments started bouncing, I was told for hardship we will give you Credit. After 2 days I called them back. They told me to bugger off as they will take 10 days to complete the investigation.\nI asked them why didnt they block the transactions when I called them. The answer was we have to Process all transactions!\nIts weird... Now I am waiting till March 27 to get my own money back and payoff overdraft fees. I had enough of these guys. I am not sure if a recourse is available, but if there is I will pursue every inch of it.\nScamming people to get a scammed card and skimming money from it, seems there is lot than what meets the eye.","3784":"They are SO good at charging you fees, but when YOU need them, they make you miserable and make you wait in line for hours and hours and days.

Do NOT put your hard earned money in this bank.","3783":"It's so weird to hear that the bank does not give an account verification letter in the branch nor there is an option to get one from their online banking. It's only the customer service who can help with it and it takes no less than a week to 10 business days. This will be an issue for people who may need the letter in unexpected cases where they MUST have it ASAP to continue with their application(s) such as immigration status, mortgage etc. cases. And the reason I was told was even worse - because of lots of requests coming in, they stopped issuing the letter at branches. What sense it makes? I think I probably should move my funds to another institution where I get kind of things done much quicker and close the account here. Absolutely frustrated.","3782":"After 20 years as a customer with a preferred platinum status, BofA declines to refinance my mortgage.

The  representative was nice and saw the error and fixed it and said to me on a recorded phone call that it would not get sent to the credit bureau come to find out it was. So I decided to call back finally got it escalated to customer client services who was supposed to call in 24 to 48 hours which never happened I got a phone call today which is almost 2 weeks later for the lady to tell me that there's Nothing they can do to fix it so basically he's allowed to lie to me on a recorded phone call and nothing gets done. When I asked if she can read the transcript back to me the part where he lied she said she didn't have it in front of her when the beginning of our phone call she said she did another lie on a Recorded phone call. When does it stop lies lies lies and on top of it all she got very upset that I was upset and got very unprofessional very quick. I'm filing a complaint because I want that 30 day late payment to come off of my credit report as I was told it would on a recorded phone call.

They offer no other way to authenticate. This, after you provide all info such as phone pin (what is the use of this if not to authenticate?!), social security number, name, address, employer and answer all kinds of ridiculous questions.

Here are just a few items that all add up to my complete dis-satisfaction:1.)\tMy family have never been charged for accounts, and now all our checking accounts are being assessed $122.)\tAs my kids were growing up, they saved coin. We used to make it a learning experience to bring in their bags to the bank and deposit them into their savings accounts. In the beginning, they brought in a bag or jar and branches would dispense in a machine and then deposit. Years later you had to ask for paper rolls, roll it yourself and deposit. Now you make it so difficult with rules your steer customers to grocery stores with machines that take 20-30% commission. I think banks should manage and deal with money of all sorts in my humble opinion.3.)\tMy son went off to college this year, so we went into our local branch to cash in the savings bonds he had been given every year starting at birth from his grandparents for college. To our dismay, the teller told us that he could only cash a maximum of 5. Really???? These are government instruments! We had to drive around Orange County to 4 different branches to get them cashed for his trip off to TX. Absurd really. Talk about not being customer friendly. Not even the manager is empowered to make logical decisions. I almost closed accounts on the spot.4.)\tStopped in the other day to pick up an extra check register, as they only sent a couple with my last check order. Again \u2013 just another thing I could not accomplish while in the branch. They don\u2019t carry them anymore and told me I had to call customer service. Well \u2013 that was even more of a frustration as your bank sends you to a 3rd party in India (it sounded like) and they wanted to charge me $2 per blank paper register! It took 45 minutes to get through the right prompts, transfers etc. and actually talk to a person. The prompts all kept wanting to order new checks \u2013 nothing for registers.5.)\tYour website and mobile app have no way of giving you your current balance. What I mean is that if you pay using bill pay, it does not deduct it immediately from your balance until it processes which is usually at least a week out. So \u2013 you have no easy way to know your \u201creal\u201d balance until everything clears \u2013 this the reason for check registers. If I had to guess even though software change would make lives easier, BofA looks at bounced check charges as a revenue stream. Why make it simple??6.)\tI don\u2019t write that many checks, but recently wrote one to a contractor and he went to my branch on the way home. He had all the proper identification, yet they charged him $8.00 to cash my check, from my branch, at my bank! I think this is ridiculous. They even called me to verify which is fine, but still charged him. I was not happy.There have been long periods where I have had $25k as my standing balance and sometimes much more. Interest paid at your bank is embarrassing. I took my recent company stock cash in of $150K and moved it from your institution to one that paid 2% for their premium savings account. Your loss .

The bank teller just handed it right over.Fake checks scams often entail using an out of state business check with a value between $1200 - $2000. Bank tellers should know this. This person deposited two of them into my account and withdrew $3000. Both checks were from small businesses in New York City. I feel like this might have been a red flag.What's even scarier is Bank of America's appalling lack of the use of ArtificiaI Intelligence and Machine Learning. A simple AI rule could have thrown up about 20 red flags. Let's see, I never go into banks. Ever. I never go to banks in Spartanburg, SC. I live in Baltimore. I never deposit checks in person. It's always through the mobile app. I never withdraw cash in large amounts. I have no reason to be in SC, depositing checks from NYC.Let me reiterate.

I have seen a lot of reviews on BOA stealing money or being bad in customer service in terms of resolving issues and I can confirm this because I have had 2-3 other cases with this bank with fraud.

Thank goodness I paid off the loan in 2017.","2714":"Extremely poor customer service with Bank of America. I have been using Bank of America for 10+ years.  I loved the personal online banking so I chose to open my business accounts with them but it has been an exhausting experience. Horrible customer service and support.  Long waits to get a local banker with lots of turn over.  Despite my long list of accts and amt of money and business I do with them, I am considering switching to another banking entity so that I can get a business banker that I can do business with so to assist me, freeing me up to concentrate on business instead of spend hours on the phone with them. As a physician and a business owner, using bank of America for business has been one of the worst business decisions I have made thus far.","2713":"Online banking very good but customer service so bad","1917":"Great customer service. Easy to transfer from my checking account to credit card so that I can easily pay my bills. recently raised my credit limit","1918":"BOA Visa checks for unusual purchases specific to card holder, investigates fraud does not make cardholder pay until investigation complete. 24 hour contact with person. Replaces card if needed overnight.","3799":"I was initially approved for a mortgage, so I shopped around for a home and I found one. I put $2,000.00 down on the home I found. After about 85 days of being approved and my credit rating of 800+, I was preparing for the closing and they suddenly denied me a $60,000 mortgage on a $155,000 home. I already had over most of the money for the home but they declined my mortgage, so I had to tap in my 401K retirement fund so I would not lose the home I found and the $2,000 deposit, I put down on it. They were uncaring and were awful to work with.","2715":"I had my account with them for so many years but for them the most important is to make their money so for those who has a low income  probably bank of America is not the choice to keep you money I wish they care a little more for their customers especially when they keep everything up today and they are loyal for so many years","3800":"My mortgage was assumed by Bank of America when Countrywide mortgages ceased to do business. My mortgage increased without any explanation. When I inquired, they stumbled and gave me the run around. I\u2019d NEVER do business with Bank of America again.","2716":"Do not ruin your business with Bank of America merchant services. Do not trust this service. A year ago I assisted a customer using boa merchant services and the customer paid 10k and boa merchant is still holding the funds from the transaction. The customer has paid and we have serviced the customer but we still have not received the funds. They are one of the worst companies to trust with your funds.

Smart cheating accountant who crunch number making you account confusing to understand.","3802":"They do not always apply your payments to your mortgage. Payments \"get lost\". Then this goes on for a while until they try to take your home from you. Foreclosure. They are not available to discuss with you. Never call back.","1919":"This card is terrible. Interest rate is good cause I\u2019ve had it for a long time but the 100 dollar annual fee pretty much cancels that out. Rewards don\u2019t exist for this card. Wouldn\u2019t recommend.","2717":"Worst bank ever.they hold a check from an account with money in it for 10 days.","3801":"This is the worst bank that you can bank with in the US. As an immigrant, you get excited about choosing this bank because it has \"America\" on its name. But beware, this is a shark eating bank. They will deny a check, that was $3 short and charge you $35 in overdraft fees even though you have money remitted to the account on the same day. Please bank with local banks. This is a giant corporation that doesn't care a hoot about their customers. Please avoid them like Ebola!","2718":"Do they have anyone working Customer service any more?  Not only do you have to hear one right after the other sorry for the wait, there is a wait every time you call.   Then they transfer you  wait again and you have to explain again and again.  Damn the more worried I get that no one knows their job and I have wasted 1 hour and nothing has been accomplished. My issue thankfully is not high alert but a alert.  It is my money I work for was not given. Have enough respect for your customers and hire some humans that can read more then I am sorry for your wait Thank You for your patience BS.   I do not understand how BOA  got this awful.   Hire some people train them to Pretend  that you care about your customers money.

Take some pride you were a powerhouse at one time and were capable to have your customers trust you at one time.","2996":"Bank of America charged me an overdraft fee for something that was taken out in the middle of the night even though I put the funds into the account that same morning, do not bank with them, they are trash and so is their customer service ","3803":"Bank of America is the worst when it comes to setting credit cards on autopay. I have spent hours and several phone calls with personal bankers and vps to help me to no avail! I have more than 30 business accounts\/credit cards and yet can't seem to figure their mess. I hate them!","3804":"Absolutely would not recommend this bank for a small business. I have a small business SDVOSB, I live overseas and am unable to login to their site, when I call the 888 number it takes more than ten calls just to get through. Insult to injury call waiting times are usually more than 15 minutes. The local branch I sent the account up with in order to have a person and phone number is not able to assist. I am forced to use a 888 number that as mentioned above is virtually impossible to access. Caveat Emptor with this \"business banking\".","3805":"My experience with this Bank of America is disappointing. In 2010 due to a sudden death of my late mother, there\u2019s was no will but a quitclaim, unfortunately the bank did want to work with me any longer, it took a lot of attorneys and money every time I had to fill out a modification just to turn me down. This went on for years and managed to sell the notes to other banks so I can start over again.? This was a complete nightmare, I would not recommend this bank to anyone for a mortgage, because they're fraudulent.","1132":"Im a chef and a single mom. Havent always been great with my finances. Dont think I even checked my credit until I had a great new salary and still couldnt get a home loan. Checked it out then got with my Local Bank of America.

Thanks wallethub!??","3806":"They hound you for a nickel...they want your assets, your home. BOA rude and threatening. I believe they do not want to work with you...they rather want your house. They have been warned and fined. Never use them, protect your assets. They charge 125.00 on a late bill. It\u2019s criminal.","2998":"Terrible...received a promotional email offer to get a $10 statement credit by downloading their app and making a payment...did exactly that, and waited the 10 weeks (as this was done by 12\/5\/2019), and still no statement credit.  I called their customer service 3x and they said yes, I see you qualified and did that offer, we will have to get back to you.  This is $10!!!! How can't you just credit my account for an offer I received\/and did almost 3 months ago?!  My **************** card gave me my $200 bonus offer after 2 weeks of opening an account...I would never recommend Bank of America to anyone, especially with their false advertising offers....fraudulent company for sure!","2997":"Bank of America has stolen my money.\n\nI deposited 4 total checks in December of 2019 with Bank of America. In January, they reversed the deposits, as their system flagged them as duplicate checks. They were 4 individual dividend checks for the same amount, but all with different check #'s and issue dates. I have called Bank of America 6x now, have filed 3 formal complaints with them, and they have still not re-deposited the funds back into my account. The broker cannot re-issue the checks to be to try and deposit again, because Bank of America deposited the funds to their system. This is theft, plain and simple.\n\n","2719":"Highly appreciative for Bill Green as being one of the  customer service representatives to help; he me made it easy, clear, and as fast as possible to get me set up and going I loved the service and learned so much thanks.","1133":"BOA approached me to apply for loan refinance, took four months of back and forth only to be rejected in the end. Went to local credit union thereafter and was approved and processed within 30 days, loan done. Reality is BOA is slow, inefficient and has horrible customer service when it comes to trying to resolve issues. My recommendation is stay away.","3807":"My second mortgage was purchased by Bank of America and I was impressed at how easy they were to make payments to and deal with while they had my mortgage. Unfortunately, they sold it to a less reputable company without warning and once I wasn't a customer, stopped answering my emails. If they had excellent service, they would have continued doing so even though they sold my mortgage, but at that point they didn't care.","2720":"Im extremely disappointed, I expected better service!! After many many years being loyal with this bank they didn't care to help me!! I don't recommend it to people. Its time for me to change to a different more professional bank.","3810":"Bank of America has shielded information in past as they supposedly sold the mortgage services to a third party collector when in good standing with their company which led to fraudulent transactions, charges, and other behaviors. The 3rd party company was not a bank nor were they regulated by federal government or agencies at the time. Ultimately leading to me losing my home to a person that legally had no rights to said property as it was stolen from me along with my belongings in the home. I was charged various fees, escrow was depleted, and with multiple complaints to higher authorities resulted in no avail. ","3809":"Great experience in dealing with Bank of America. The process was made smooth and simple, though lot of paperwork. The person who helped us was very flexible with the timings. I highly recommend to others.","3808":"Too many to list. Been a customer since its predecessor 'Nations Bank'. Customer service is very poor, reps are rude and there's a long wait for a live person to come online. Banking centers are ill-staffed, if you want to meet anyone in person. Avoid this bank if you can, try Chase.","1134":"Calling customer service is regularly a hassle. Long wait times, clunky and cumbersome phone menu. The online apps are not laid out well. I find myself searching for things and they are not intuitive in many ways. I am constantly set notifications that are not valid, I call in waste a bunch of time then am told that the notification was a mistake. The banking has exorbitant fees. Capital One has been the exact opposite in comparison.","1135":"Decent card for cash back 3% online shopping 2% groceries, gas, restaurants and 1% on everything else. BoA has good customer service on the credit side but horrible customer service on the personal banking side which is your checking and savings accounts.","3812":"I deposited my student financial aid check into my Bank of America checking account at the branch located 2821 Pfingsten Rd, Glenview, IL 60026 on 02\/27\/2020. Before depositing my student financial aid check, I asked the bank teller how long will it take my check to clear as I am a current Chase Bank Customer also, and I cannot wait or have a hole placed on my student aid check. I continued informing the bank teller, I am travelling out of the country and need immediate access to my funds. I also expressed, if my funds will not be made available to me immediately (within 1-3 days) by Bank of America, I will deposit my funds into my Chase Banking Account.

CUSTOMER SERVICE didnt care, won't offer a solution & told me speaking to a supervisor won't help. They will tell me same thing & stated branch should not have told me differently!!! I'm a single person with only my income and on a tight budget. WTF!! This is the worst experience I have EVER had.","3813":"Had an insurance claim and they were just plain rude about signing my check so I paid off my mortgage and went to another bank. I would never recommend them to anyone nor would I ever go there for a loan or for an account. Rip off artists.","3814":"They offered a free checking account to make it easy to pay the mortgage and I believe they offered a free safety deposit box as well. I enjoyed having them as my mortgage holder. The free items did help..I felt appreciated as a customer.","2999":"I'd give negative stars if I could. Closing my account 3\/2. Just waited in line of approx 10 people for a 17-year-old snotty teenager to tell me my debit card was declined. Twice. I have been a BOA customer for 25+ years, and check my account daily. BOA took it upon themselves AGAIN to close down my card because they deemed something fraudulent. It's not. In the middle of a ridiculously hectic weekend, I'm now placing numerous charges on a credit card, while trying to get BOA on the phone to get them to unlock my card or at least not cancel the stupid thing. The whole \"call this number immediately\" is a complete joke. On hold for over 45 minutes, promises to call me back, phone rings once and then I'm hung up on. I'm so done.","3283":"DO NOT REFINANCE With BOA We were referred to a BOA to refinance our mortgage through a family member and it was a complete nightmare! The terms of the loan kept changing and the underwriting requirements so painful we finally decided to switch to a different lender, Golden One Credit Union. We paid $900 for an appraisal from BOA and requested they transfer it to Golden One so we would not have to pay for another one. However, BOA refused to do so despite numerous requests, citing regulations. Now we must shell out another $500 for a new appraisal. I strongly advise against every obtaining a new mortgage or refinancing with BOA. I live in Sunnyvale, CA","2721":"their automatic phone support is worst.","3815":"It was a pleasure working with them. They are Nationwide, have lower rates and have applicable discounts.

Stole money from me when I had account in it in the 1980'S and never tried to return the money, every time I deposited the money it had to take over a hundreds of dollars for them and it is the truth.","1136":"Awesome Good bank credit card. Nice credit builder and repair.Receive great cash back rewards monthly back into your bank account.","1138":"BEWARE! Due date fell on the National holiday and my bank posted the payment the day after. Was charged a late fee and when I called to have the fee waived they REFUSED to do so. I was never late with my payments not with this card nor with any others and have been with BOA for many years and it was my number one card I used. Won't be anymore.","2723":"Hello , I am highly disappointed in my bank after being a loyal customer for many years.

A mobile deposit was made a few days prior, I was notified the funds would not available until 10 days later! I spoke with a two representatives and they both stated that approval for verification was pending and assured me, \"There was nothing they could do.\" I was devastated to know that a loyal customer for many years, could be left financially deserted, as I did not have any other credit cards or cash on hand. I was left with no way to pay for meals, transportation back to the airport or even the luggage airline fee to return home. The personal check that was deposited via mobile app was from my brother's acct as he confirmed that the funds has already been withdrawn from his bank. I never thought that BoA could do such a thing.","1139":"Dont trust this bank of all first they give you a credit card end then decide if to close ur account even if i dont miss any payment so dont trust of all i want a bank that trust in people","40":"Complaints were made to Charlotte HQs. The Nigerian Regional Manager was made aware. He made excuses for his branch managers - one who was Indian and the other was a Latino. There are few Black branch managers in Houston area.African Americans need to avoid this bank at all costs. Their telephone customer service and branch managers are biased against African-Americans. Recently, I had to give FIVE CLEARANCES in order for them to gain access to my aged accounts. Account#s, last deposit, Tele#, and address. It was RIDICULOUS and very unusual. Then BOA branch managers would not cash contractors cashiers checks despite one contractor and myself having numerous active\/aged accounts with BOA. A white contractor stated that she had never seen anything like it and didn't understand the rejection.I hate Bank of Amerikkka. Bank of America has had racial issues in the past. I believe they were sued.Currently, there are few walk-in branches located in densely Black neighborhoods only drive-ups - if that. BOA used to offer impeccable customer service. Not anymore. It's a dump.Black people need to bank with an institution that respects all of its customers. Bank of Amerikkka does not.If I could give BOA 0 stars, I would.","2724":"Their automated system is less pleasurable than getting a root canal. Every single time I call I have to go around in circles for 15 minutes, just to be put on hold to get a call-back 30 minutes later because they're too busy. I think this is a strategy on their part... Just annoy the customer for long enough and they'll give up trying.Well, after 20 years banking with them, I'm going to give up alright... and go bank elsewhere.","41":"Customer service is very difficult to deal with. Sound courteous but are very dismissive at the same time. I would guess they only reason they wanted to give me this card was because an AMEX makes them more money.","42":"They are worst bank ever!!!!! I would not recommend this bank to anyone. All about taking all of your money and no compassion for others whatsoever","46":"So they punish you and charge you fees for being poor. AMAZING THESE BANKS PENALIZE YOU IF YOU DONT HAVE A DIRECT DEPOSIT OF 200 OR NORE. There's plenty of mentally challenged people that only work 1 day a week and dont make over 200.

Go to First National Bank Of Omaha instead -they're human beings you can talk with in person or over the phone and not feel like you are talking to a robot.

Put me on hold and Never came back. I called them at 7:07 pm it is now 7:37 pm and he hasn't checked back on with me yet. His last words were \"ok not sure how long this hold will be\". DISSAPOINTED AND SO RUDE. I'm still waiting to talk to his manager, he just checked in at 7:45 pm and said he would be right back. It is now 7:51 pm and he made sure we we're still holding...still waiting. Pretty sure he's playing a game. Sad And pathetic","44":"Bank of America does not care about customer service at all. I was approved for a car loan yet they wouldn\u2019t give me the money because it was an independent dealer they don\u2019t work with.

If you need a notary -- don't go to the bank.  Of the six employees on hand, only one is a notary...and he\/she likely busy.  Suggested to manager that should have multiple notaries.  Manager said I could go to another BoA branch....great answer.Complained to the BoA website.  Received a call from some arrogant person out of Charlotte office.  Very rude.

When I visited the branch, there were only three customers standing in line -- and there was no one to serve them! After a few minutes a single teller showed up. Then the tellers changed and there were further delays. The staff are pretty sour and unhelpful. The reason I visited the branch was because I used their drive-in ATM and it ate my debit card. When you're traveling, this isn't a good thing to happen, because you can't get a replacement from your own bank. Bank of America couldn't (wouldn't?) do anything about it, and they couldn't help me complete the transaction that I had started.

I provided the legal service  to my customers.  However, two weeks later, BOA took away $300 from my account because my customer filed a fraud claim to BOA stating that the payment is a fraud and she never knew me.  I was astonished to learn that because BOA has never talked to me or tried to listen to my side.  They believed the payer's claim and took away the money from my account and gave to that person.

The managers do not follow through, do not keep promises and do not call you back as they committed.Had so many problems with B of A over the years. Been with them for 25 plus years now. When I refinanced I did not even look at B or A. I would not recommend anyone use them.","2245":"If you know how to pay your bill on time everything will work out good for you.

They could not help me online after the wait, they said there is no way to delete the old phone number","150":"The most expensive, unhelpful and overly complicated bank in the history of the universe! I feel stupid for wasting 16 years banking with them! Every year it gets more expensive, and absolutely NO ONE that works there has been able to help me. They held my check for several days, Bill's came out during that time and they charged me 35 dollars per transaction, telling me I over drafted, when reality, they just held my funds for a week! I wish that only happened once, I should not have trusted when they assured me it wouldn't happen again. Terrible and expensive bank.","2728":"If I could give less than one star I would.

So, apparently they didn\u2019t have proof of my coverage-sent that 2X. Next, they didn\u2019t know the exact amount to pay-got that verified. Then, they mailed the check to the wrong address-manager \u201cfixed\u201d that when I left a not so positive review (like now). Well, she called me and stated all was well and even told me to call my insurance company and ask for a refund for the amount that I had paid, lol. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t do that. Well, I waited and called today 2\/18\/2020 because the check was supposedly sentsent via FedEx on 02\/06\/2020. Nope, my insurance company NEVER received it. So, I\u2019m back on the phone with BOA and the rep is throwing out these tracking numbers and telling me to call my insurance company. No ma\u2019am that is NOT my job . She got on my nerves. Anyway, I was transferred to ANOTHER manager who is supposed to overnight it AGAIN. And the payment should be received by 02\/21\/2020. I hate BOA and would never recommend them.

Couldn\u2019t help me in buying companion ticket for flight. Perfect credit but only extended $1000 limit. Paid balance each month to be eligible for companion ticket but wouldn\u2019t extend $320 credit to purchase flight. Must use their card to purchase both flight and companion ticket $1320. Asked if I could pay cash, told no. No options available to use my earned benefit. Asked if I could load card with $1500, told no. Asked if they could raise limit for one purchase, told no. Every representative sympathized and wished there was something they could do. Every representative apologized. Love Alaska Airlines, not impressed with Bank of America.

The chip and pin card works well in Europe. The statements are clear, and it is easy to pay online. Just got an email reminding me that the special promotional rate for a balance transfer offer I used will be ending in 90 days. I appreciate the reminder, and I think that is a great way for BvA to prevent possible misunderstandings. In the past I've been an outspoken critic of BvA on several issues - guess I have to eat my words now.

I called a few days later to change my account information and during this process, I was penalized $25 for a late payment. (Not my fault, I was locked out!)

My wife tried to use a 0% APR check to repay a small loan and it was refused for fraud alert. They called our home number when nobody was here and only gave 3 hour window to return the call. Customer service said send the other check and it will go through and will not be flagged. The 2nd check ended up being denied again a week later and once again they called our home # and only gave a 3 hour window to call back before denial. Fraud and customer service just kept transferring us back and forth and we had to explain the situation over and over again every time we were transferred. Finally gave up after the 4th transfer with no answers. Don't bother sending the 0% checks with the bills if you don't want people to use them. Also my wife is disabled and has severe speech issues so when she called she gave them her information and asked them to speak to me to make it easier since she is the cardholder and I cannot just call on her behalf. While most reps were ok with that the last one absolutely refused to speak to anyone other than my wife not caring that she gave her permission to allow me to speak for her while she was on the other line. Will never use B of A again. We are transferring our remaining balance to another card company and shredding this one. She had this card for years with another bank, but B of A bought them out a year or 2 ago and we have had nothing, but issues ever since.","3004":"Why are you so incompetent?

They've been pretty reasonable so far. Their treatment of us over the past couple weeks has lost our business forever. I guess there are some federal regulations that require banks to verify their customers' personal information is correct. That's fine. To contact us about this, they sent emails and (apparently) physical letters. Personally, if I get an email or a letter saying our account is in danger etc etc, my scam alert goes up and I ignore it. \"If it were that important, they would call.\"","3823":"For many years I used direct payment method to pay my Bank of America Visa card bills in full. This way my payments are always on time and in full. In November 2019 I called Bank of America customer service and asked the representative to change my direct payment from one bank account to another. The female representative said it was done and gave me a confirmation number. On January 30, 2020 I received a notice from my credit reporting agency, TransUnion. I checked and found that Bank of America had reported that I was delinquent on two bills. Consequently my near perfect credit score plummeted. I was surprised and puzzled. How could that be?","2736":"need change or update your profile good luck takes you at least 30 minutes to get customer service and after i wait that time i was disconnected and those things can't be done online by yourself. two accounts disappear from my profile to fix this must call them and is horrible the wait. like we don't have nothing to do.","623":"We use this card for bigger purchases and always pay regularly each month NEVER had any problems and the cash rewards are always used as payment for the monthly bill","3006":"Worst Financial Insitution, It's taking a FULL WEEK to clear a check that even has bank of america's logo on the check. now i have to delay my bills because bank of america is slow, if my funds are not cleared by thursday 01\/06\/2020 by 9am like ******************** said, i will personally make it apparant let everyone know that bank of america is slow as **** and doesnt know what their doing.","3825":"This bank is horrible. I have never done business with them and I never will. They allowed someone using my name to open six (6) accounts in my name. They sent statements which alerted me to the problem. I called to tell them that I had not opened the accounts and the activity was fraudulent. The computer that answers the phone wouldn't connect me to ANY department until I gave them my account number or social security number. Since I had not opened the accounts, I didn't have an account number and since their bank had already allowed fraud to be committed in my name, I did not want to give them my social. I had to take a back door to get to an agent.","3826":"I'm a customer since 2003 and recently when I called to Bank of America they gave me incorrect information that cost me money, When I spoke with the supervisor, only said, \"Sorry for this wrong information.\" I will not recommended anymore this Bank.

B of A is very good at making getting fees from even the financially responsible customers. Basically any time I have a low account balance I will try to deposit checks to avoid over drafting. Conveniently enough most times I do this my check is \"held\" for over a week so not only do I get over drafted but I dont have that money in my other bank account.","625":"This bank really sucks. They can decide any time to put a hold on anything you will deposit and there will be no way to bring your account to have an available balance. Then they start charging you for no sufficient funds fee , when actually they got the money as it already left the check writer's account. And now comes the main thing. Neither the bank branch banker or the so called customer service have any ability to make any changes. All they can do is apologize and apologize and again apologize. You would want to call them ''Apologize Service '' instead of customer service.","624":"I was at BOA at a branch in Santa Ana California, 17th street and Main. Worst service I have ever experienced, one hour to get to the teller, only two girls, one of them was her first day of work. The worst thing was that the manager just stood there, and when confronted. She sheltered ounder \"We have a new girl\", she left for lunch rather than attending custumers. Decided to take my bussiness somewhere else.","2739":"Ive had a business relationship with this bank for over 16 years, including credit cards and checking account.  they collected on thousands of fees from me, never late on any payments.  I applied for credit line this december, they got all the necessary information, and disappeared, no emails, no phone calls, nothing. I finally got a hard letter last week that I was denied for not having enough liquidity for their standards, so I went to Chase, they turned around approved my business within a week.  Worst part about BoA is that people who work there, they hide behind their guidelines and never even talk to you. Sad really.","3007":"I have RV loan with Bank Of America. We have paid two months the required payment and additional money to go against principal. This is first loan where everyone from local bank to online support does not know what to do with the extra funds- apply to principal. Plus the extra payments cant be seen by my online account. How can a company of this size can not manage a simple loan payment. Looking for another lender to take over the loan.","2738":"ZERO customer service. Run away and don't look back!I've been a BofA customer for more than 15 years. When I first joined, they were kind and professional. Customer service was very good. Now they just don't seem to care about anything other than taking your money from you. Honestly, if you have ANY other options, avoid BofA at all costs.Example: I can't ever seem to speak to a phone representative due to their awful computerized answering system. If you manage to get through the maze they put at the start of every phone call, be ready for a wait. Call in the middle of the night? 40 minute wait. Call on a weekend? 40 minute wait. Maybe 9-5 is better, but that's when I work, so I would have to miss work to call at that time. Local agents are clueless how to help on their credit card accounts and tell you to call the customer service line, and they have no way to skip the wait. BofA, if you care at all about customers, stop worrying so much about making your stockholders profit, and bring some good, old-fashioned American customer service back to your cold-as-ice profit machine. After proceeding through the phone answering system, it wouldn't surprise me if the poor phone agents are typically berated, which also makes me wonder about the employee's working conditions. Again, for your own sake and sanity, STAY AWAY FROM B of A!","3828":"I received a letter from BOA in November to thank me for opening an account with them which I never did. I immediately called in to close this account and it took about 2 hours just to get through to someone.

NO Integrity, Dishonest, Uncaring. I would NEVER recommend doing any business with this corrupt, unapologetic company.","627":"Hard to get balance increases.

I'm now 64. I have had some good service over the years but I've also truly terrible service. At different times I've been treated very badly, usually by a woman who doesn't know her own banking procedures or rules. Usually the men have been a lot more courteous. Their phone system is horrible to **. Every time I call it, I have trouble. I speak normally with no accent, BofA's phone system can't understand me. Compare the customer service of BofA with Discover card, it's night and day different. Discover is 100% better. I could list here years upon years of problems and everyone's eyes would start bleeding at the boredom of it all. I'll just tell one story. Recently I was on BofA's website and they had security software you could download called Trusteer Rapport, so I thought I'd try it while I waited on hold for customer support (took 29 minutes to get a person). The IBM software Trusteer Rapport that is being pushed by 100's of banks world wide is a nightmare. Both Firefox and Chrome browsers refused to load. My system slowed. I have a Windows 10 gaming system that is fast with all drivers and all software updated, and no virus. I read the reviews on the software BofA was handing out free. A lot of people have had a lot of systems and software problems. Also, getting it off your system is a nightmare. I actually had to get help to finally do it. So I called BofA again and told their security and web support people about it. They said they'd never heard of it. So they had an Executive Escalations person call me. She denied BofA was giving this software out in the rudest of manners, just insulting. I was nicely directed her to the URL of the BofA banking site where they hawk this nightmare software. She was amazing, \"I've never seen that before\". Well, just one more really bad experience with customer service at BofA. I hate them. I have so many direct deposit accounts and my big safe deposit box there, it's just too much trouble to change. I've never had ONE PROBLEM with US Bank and I've been with them a very long time.","3830":"Good afternoon, On October 7th 2019 I returned a vehicle to Aruba Thrifty car rental. Upon inspection I was charged an additional 100 dollars for what they say was a small again SMALL DING in the front fender. I send BofA proof of pictures and all the documents I had. They credited me the money and then this morning they put the 100 dollars back on my Credit Card. I hope you need the 100 because you just lost me, my family, my friends, and any enemies may have. I will make it my mission to make sure nobody uses Bank of America ever again. ","2741":"Bank of America has the rudest workers who are not helpful.

Due to that I could not gain miles for a trip I purchased. Then, I did a balance transfer on my 2 credit cards and they assured me that the balance will be transferred within a 14 day time period. Once I received the statement, it showed that the balance was not accurately transferred and that there was $0.79 shortage of funds that was supposedly late (over a $3k balance!) After calling customer service they were not helpful at all and said that I \"confirmed\" on a recording that the amount I transferred ($3k minus $0.79) was correct. I asked to listen to the recording because I don't believe that it was correct, and they said that they cannot access the recording! Not only did I have to pay a late fee, they also interest charge on the full amount because of their mistake! All of this over $0.79!!! Needless to say, I will be cancelling my BOA account and I strongly suggest to anyone that they use a different source for their banking needs.","3831":"Been a Bank of America customer for over 30 years. Was charged a $25 maintenance fee for a checking account that they no longer offer. They did reverse the charge and said I would never receive another charge.

I can't believe they'll risk for 30-year customer for $25 charge.","3833":"I've been dealing with Bank of America branch at 1450 Walton Way Augusta GA 30901. Over the past 8 years since I've moved here and over the past 3-5 years they have done things there way.

I'll explain as well as I will be taking my problem to the Corporate office as well as the Better Business Bureau and advise everyone else to do the same. ","629":"The BankAmericard credit card is amazing. It was my MVP a few years back, helping me pay off a pretty sizable balance from another card that was charging an arm and a leg in interest. The 0% period is longer than most (if not all) other balance transfer cards, the balance transfer fee is standard, and there\u2019s no annual fee. So, I don\u2019t really see why anyone would say they didn\u2019t like this card. Either they\u2019re off their rocker or they transferred their balance after the 60-day window to get a 0% rate. Or they didn\u2019t pay on time and got stuck with the card\u2019s high regular rate. Or their application got rejected because they didn\u2019t have an excellent credit score. Ok, sure, there are ways your relationship with this BankAmericard could go sour, but it\u2019s a lot less likely than with some other credit cards.","2743":"Shameful. This is the worst company ever. I had a merchant scam me out of my money. I tried to file a dispute and they did absolutely nothing to help. Instead, the made my life difficult and gave me the run around.

Why was I allowed to open an account online and able to transfer money if they were going to close it anyways? I asked them what if there were no locations nearby and they told me there was nothing they could do.

He points to his office and tells me to sit again. I never said a word to him. Upon entering I drop my credentials onto his desk. He immediately goes berserk. He screams, he \"will not tolerate attitude in his bank\". He further claims I threw my driver license at him. Fact is, he wasn't even sitting at his desk when I dropped my license on his desk. He was three feet behind me. He told me all he \"has to do is press a button and I would be removed by armed guards\". This strange little man has issues. Maybe it has to do with his country of origin or his sexual orientation. Whatever his problem, he should not be allowed to deal with the public. It's just not fair to normal people. Bank of America is truly scraping the bottom of the cultural barrel by subjecting us to foreign low-life, weirdos. Also, he pretended his computer was broken and I finally just left.

They do not deserve any stars and according to the fine print when you open your account they can do this to whoever they want whenever they want.

Although I was a \"valued customer\" without any delinquencies, and although I have consistently funneled of money through their bank, I was shut down without any warning or conversation.

However, I called the automated line and was told my check is holding and will be released on January 30th. This is a big problem!! I have small kids and have no idea what I am supposed to do for money until then. I called their customer service department and was basically told \"I understand how you feel\". How could you possibly understand how I feel when I can't even feed my kids. What makes matters worse, is no one could tell me why my check has been put on extended hold.

Somehow, after I renewed my cards (credit and debit) in 2019. BOA set up something wrongly into my current cards\/accounts so that I can never purchase any international items, they keep require additional verification steps so that it failed ALL purchases including buying directly international flight tickets from Air Thai, Qatar Airways.... websites (NOT thru any ticket agency \/ tourist services).

Then when you thought, as you were told before, that everything is fine you find out \"oh well good luck on your home but we are backing up and not closing on it\". Please save your time and sanity and go with someone else who at least will respect you.","2750":"Bank of America has consistently been the worst customer service experience of my 30+ years as a professional. They make it nearly impossible to speak to someone live, and when they do, that person always (not sometimes, always) needs to transfer you to someone else who can help - but they never can and want to transfer you elsewhere. I'm paying off my credit card and terminating my relationship after 15+ years of being an exceptional customer - who is not valued in the least, it's clear in every interaction. I will never consider them for a credit card, loan, mortgage, financial advice, or any product. It's exhausting working with them.

They will create a SCAM report and request you file a police report and pass along the case number.Think of this way. A fraudulent BOA account holder requests that a honest BOA account transfer money using Zelle. Once the deposit is made into the fraudulent BOA holders account, or criminal enterprise, BOA will protect and the FDIC will insure the funds in the fraudulent BOA account holder, but not the sender.Zelle will do nothing to investigate or recover and neither will Bank of America. Do not transfer funds using Zelle to pay for a service, or pay a vendor. The local BOA branch is not empowered to manage fraud claims. The fraud abuse call center is not empowered to do anything other than repeat that there is nothing they can do to assist.Amanda Holcomb is the SVP that appears to own the corporate relationship with Zelle. I provided the BOA abuse team with several suggestions to avoid fraud between BOA account holders.","1031":"Good card for travel.

Their whole user experience flow of their mobile app is entirely broken. every click takes 5 seconds to load. Unable to use the application to setup apple pay.

Stay away from Spirit Card. I fell for their Statement credit promotion after spending $500 over 3-months. Now BofA says they have no knowledge of that and it is Spirit Airlines responsibility!

Never mentioned he needed to upload my drivers license. The following week I went to the drive up ATM, deposited $2,480. Drove back to work, signed into my account online and Zelle'd my landlord $1,000. About 20 minutes later I went to sign back into my account to finish my online bill pay and I was give a message to call 1-800 regarding my account. I call and I get transferred to Risk Closure, they inform me that my account was closed due to not uploading my drivers license to my account. I start panicking, so I call the Banker who helped me the week prior, he was not able to help.

Then the branch manager \" Thomas Hyunh\" stepped in to say that he will allow only $2500, as I dont have an account. I mentioned the teller's number and said, she agreed to $10k. Now Thomas started yelling that he can only give $2500, and threatening to cancel transaction.. and everyone in line could hear him yelling. He tried to humiliate me in front of other people, and yelled at me.. when I asked him, why he was yelling.. and asked to see his manager, he said I cant .

I kind of felt behind a couple of payment. So bank of America started harassing me. They destroy my credit.i had to borrow the money so that I can pay them.i call to pay the credit limit of the card which was 2500 hundred. At customer service I started talking to Andrew.rigth away andre told me the balance I was suprised to hear that all the time that I was paying. The balance keep raising. Even I was paying when I ask how much money was all together there was 203 dollars more on the balance I ask where does chargers came from. He said late fees ontop of late fees. But that. There was more. So I told him I wanted to talk to the supervisor. Which he got me.hi.s name is mark Sanchez started talking tothis so call supervisor. he was worse than the first one this mark Sanchez even added the fees from today with mark Sanchez the balance got higher. And then another fee that he had to add because some payment process.by the time he was done it was almost 3000dollars and the 3 plus 37 cents. So I ask what happened to the money that I was paying on the balance. It does not matter that you paid. You where behind a couple of payments so the late fees just added up.i got one of those cash rewards cards. So I ask mark Sanchez. How much cash back rewards points do I have mark Sanchez told me that the point went lost because I was a couple of payment late.so I lost them how is that possible. What kind of card is this you pay all the time on time and this is the way a long time customer gets there  rewards. And then you get treated like some kind of lowlife..because you went through a hardship. You would understand that you're bank would have some kind of humanity. But for bank of America is all about the money. Sorry to say. I call this bank of America customer service and I was laughs at belittle made to be a fool because I wanted to pay of this cash rewards credit card that I did not wanted in the first place we where lied to we wanted a person loan not a credit card. I don't understand that bank of America. Does this to faithful customers. You're customer service is just in a whole different realm. This people are disrespectful. Condecendin. And unprofessional. I need to cancel this card. Your reviews that I read about your card are desibing and the truth is far from what the reviews tell...after almost talking to mark Sanchez for almost and hour and half. Mark Sanchez wanted me pay 3 thousand and 3 plus 73 cents and he was not going to close the account because it was to new.i don't know what that meant. So I told him wanted to talk to somebody else that has a heart. Because mark doesn't have any kind of humanity. He said he was to get the supervisor that was sitting next to him.her name is Roni and she started talking about the process. Told her I was tired and wouldn't rather call in the morning. To hopefully pay the credit card with some one that is a real supervisor.i don't understand that this people want to charge me more money than what I borrow o let me refrease.

He took the cash and moved up to the next ATM and made the deposit with no issues. We noticed the next day that the deposit had double posted, so I immediately called Bank of America to make them aware of the situation and asked them to remove the double posting. I was thanked for my honesty and told that they would launch an investigation. Little did I know that the investigation was being launched on me, not the ATM. My accounts were frozen and subsequently closed. We were told that BoA had closed our accounts for  trying to \"defraud the institution\"... Defraud the institution?? I literally called them to make them aware of their mistake and yet I was being punished for it. A little over a year has gone by and I thought we were done with the entire mess. Boy, was I wrong. We went to open an account with a credit union to get a mortgage when we were notified that Bank of America placed a mark on our consumer report stating that we tried to commit fraud against them. I was on the phone for almost 4 hours yesterday and was told that the mark would stay on our report for 5-7 years. So now we can't even purchase a home because of Bank of America's faulty ATM. Oh - and the craziest part is that this happened to another couple at the exact same location and yet BoA is refusing to accept that their ATM is the problem and choosing instead to blame their customer. Stay as far away from this bank as possible. It's criminal what they're doing.","2753":"my husband was in bank of america branch and they offered us to $500 bonus to open a business checking.  So we decided to do it and we did everything that was asked to do. Now they refuse to give us the bonus and keep putting us off.

Today many financial industries\u2019 business model is to prey on economically disadvantaged people, but BoA is one of the worst, and time after time, always for a different reason, I personally get to experience it. They hide fees in massive contracts, and implement them without mercy. They place holds on checks indiscriminately, regardless of amount or from where it came, and don\u2019t bother with the inexplicably long hold time, and barely competent, surly attitude the call-room rep will inflict on you, because they will not be able to give you a reason for the hold, or an approximation of when they funds they seized will become available. This has been the case EVERY TIME they\u2019ve \u201cheld\u201d a check, and every time, they\u2019ve been wrong. They\u2019ve lied to me about when fees will occur and what those fees will be. Their customer support center ALWAYS, without a single exception has \u201cunusual call volume\u201d (Imagine my shock.) When the best a bank can do is not to technically break the law as they take as much of your money as possible, or \u201cplace a hold on your account\u201d ie to borrow as much of your money, at anytime, for any reason, without interest or even your consent, that\u2019s despicable. When the best they can offer a customer is a scripted, meaningless apology for constant mistakes resulting from unchanging, dishonest behavior, it\u2019s safe to say this is a company to be avoided at any and all costs.","3838":"I opened an account with BofA about a month ago. Today they closed my account, without reason. I had no overdraft fees, I had over $1300 in the account, I had direct deposit set up. And I went to log on and my account was locked. I called their customer service phone number and the guy told me that they decided to close my account. When I asked why he gave me some corporate spiel how they can close an account whenever and they don\u2019t need a reason. So I asked to speak to a supervisor, considering I had just deposited quite a bit of money in the account, and I had bills I needed to pay, plus I\u2019m moving across the country in a few days and I need my money.","3839":"I've been with BoA for more than five years and during that time have heard numerous personal and business acquaintances complaining about what a terrible bank BoA is. My experiences with Bank of America have been limited, but none of them have been positive. Today I went in to make a withdrawal and get some information about my account. From their manager to the 'Personal Banker' to the Teller, customer interaction was terrible. My guess is that being the crap company that they are, they are not able to get, or to keep, quality people.","1038":"Bank of America customer service is very courteous, but you never get them to do what you need. You will get the usual \"I'm so sorry to hear that\", followed by \"there is nothing I can do\", \"I know it doesn't sound reasonable, but it is in the rule book\".

Few weeks back I closed my checking account for hell lot of issues like: 1. You cannot move funds quickly, 2. Their savings account APY is the lowest in the market. 3. Lots of restrictions moving money to and from. etc. The real problem started once I close the account and tried to pay my credit card. They dont have any option to pay credit card bill online using external bank account. What the heck!!!!! So, bill payment option started throwing all sort of weirdest errors and asked me to call a number every time. You will see a new number each time you encounter an error and funny part is none of them work. Now, I started trying make payment using their phone banking. Average wait time to reach a human is 40-50 minutes. And if you try automated payment system through phone, it will either not recognize your voice command or will not leave you any option to post the payment. You have to really really yell at it to make it understand the voice command. Bottomline. Weird, teared, worst online, phone banking and mobile banking compared to competitors. Out dated products and processes. Worst customer service I have ever seen in a bank.GO AWAY from BANK OF AMERICA!! And good luck if this bank survives for long with these systems and services.","3013":"Terrible automated system. Doesn't recognize voice or numeric prompts when trying to make a payment.

They are saying that the payment needs to be after the due date to be considered for a payment for the next month, I was given wrong information and they are not refunding the $25 now. I cant believe how they steal money from you without any control or regulation..

They're just there to answer your call and treat you rudely. Don't expect your calls to really be monitored they only say that for quality control which is horrible. The notes are never correct and depending on mode of representative the notes are taken on a personal level meaning if they dont like what you say they can derail what you are trying to resolve. Don't expect to get help for getting your money back for an unauthorized transaction because even if you didn't authorize it they will not deem it as fraud that it is. Now I only found this out because if it's a large dollar amount they don't investigate. They allow themselves and others to take social security monies unlawfully.

Prior to them I had Wachovia which is now Wells Fargo and I was very unhappy with them.  Bank of America is my primary bank and has been for around 10 years now.  I have two savings accounts with them and a primary checking account with a debit card.  I use a cash rewards Visa card for all of my major purchases throughout the month and pay it off.  I get between 1-3% cash back on that card and save up around $2500 to transfer to savings accounts.  It's a great card. They have perks if you have large balances with them and you get more money in cash rewards as a bonus, free ATM withdrawals, fee waivers and such.  BoA is a large bank and has branches everywhere so that is nice when you travel around the USA as I do.  Also, they have deals with sister banks so I have been able to use ATMs without fees while outside of the USA as well on travel. I have been fortunate to have no major issues with them that require solving and have never had any huge customer service problems with them.  Twice I have been issued new cards due to strange charges and they have caught it before I did and sent me texts to verify purchases.  I've also called their customer service a few times while on travel with issues and have been able to resolve them easily and they've taken good care of me to ensure I am able to keep traveling with no issue and use my cards. The website is easy to use and you can put in travel notices and verify purchases.  I've had to refute a few duplicate or wrong charges and this process is easy as pie and can also be initiated online.  Bill pay is also great. I have ordered foreign currency and picked it up at my local branch with no issue and appreciate this service so I have cash on hand when I travel outside the USA.  All in all - a solid banking experience.","3019":"I remember being young and naive, opening up my first debit card with Bank of America as a teenager. Excited as all get out. I've been with Bank of America for a long time--about 14 years. My parents have been with Bank of America for over 30, before it was even called that (they said it had a different name).\n\n \n\nGrowing up I was taught to trust adults, to believe what people say. As I have gotten older, my upbringing influenced my decision-making.\n\n \n\nLast year, I opened up my first Business Checking account with Bank of America as well as an Account that I was told could earn my business Travel Awards. The idea of working my tail off and fighting to make my business a success, and feeling like my bank had my back felt like the true American Dream. I was going to make it happen. If I failed, I would try harder.\n\n \n\nLate last year, a teller at a gas station intentionally did not give me back my card. She swiped it for the person behind me, and he stole it. I wasn't aware I didn't have it till I left, going to the bank to deposit checks. \n\n \n\nWithin 10 minutes, I realized I didn't have it. It was too late. I had left my phone at home, and it took an eternity to get through Bank of America's automated system to get to an actual human being to freeze my card. By then, quite a sum had been spent. \n\n \n\nBut Bank of America had me. The lady was calm and sweet on the phone as I sobbed. She was reassuring. \n\n \n\nThe money was back within my account as a credit and a temporary card issued as well as a permanent within days. An investigation was opened in my county. I was so happy that Bank of America was willing to work with me to get my hard earned money back. I worked with them and the police as much as I could to track the person who stole my card down (who happened to be part of a crime ring, of course). \n\n \n\nTurns out justice isn't so just. I won't go into that part.\n\n \n\nI budget my money on another app not connected to Bank of America, as theirs is inadequate for my needs. I keep receipts and log all my purchases to the \"T.\" Routinely, I manually log and track and compute things by hand with calculator.\n\n \n\nUp until my card got stolen, all my numbers matched. \n\n \n\nAfterward, money started to \"magically\" disappear from my account. I thought I was losing my mind. I spent countless hours rechecking my calculations, only to continue to get higher numbers in my accounts (I have multiple accounts). I went to Bank of America reps for help, only for them to tell me that it must have been a problem with my numbers or algorithms in the app. I believed them. God, why did I believe them?\n\n \n\nBy the end of November, I ended up have a discrepancy of almost $300, close to the amount that was stolen from my credit card. So, did Bank of America really cover me for my loses? Or did they lie to me? \n\n \n\nI decided to go to a specialist I trusted, and have her do an audit. I told her in faith, everything. I prayed. The audit started. \n\n \n\nBank of America closed it within days and gave me no details. \n\n \n\nI was too overwhelmed to do anything. I just quit. I just let them have it at that point, praying to the heavens that this wouldn't happen again. I logged the huge account balance deficit, and fought my way through the hectic holidays.\n\n \n\nFast forward to yesterday. Minding my business, doing my business, I was manually logging bills again by hand and in the app. Everything matched. I breathed a massive sigh of relief and was about to go about my day.\n\n \n\nAnd it happened. RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES. \n\n \n\nI watched as I switched screens in my banking app and my account balance dropped $30. Like. MAGIC. INSTANTLY. No transactions were made. No pending transactions. No transfers. NO-THING. \n\n \n\nI almost went nuts. Then you know what I realized?\n\n \n\nA trillion dollar corporation cares less about you. I mean *laughs*, look at these automated responses on this page!! It's pathetic! All about appearance but it comes off as curt. They'll do what it takes to keep you and your money, even if it means lying--a crusty corrupt capitalistic corporation at its best.\n\n \n\n*hand clap* I have to give it to you though... Well done Bank of America! You made it to the top! And if it isn't obvious to anyone who reads this review how you did it (and trust me it wasn't completely honest business practices) my God are they blind like I was. Almost all top dogs will always prey upon and sacrifice the weak. \n\n \n\nPower. At all cost. Money. At all costs. \n\n \n\nBusiness can be a beautiful thing if you keep in mind that people are behind it and a business works for people, not for the betterment of itself. A business should not be, and never ever should be a separate entity. Once you treat it like one, it becomes what you feed it: and you're feeding a monster.

Some three years ago, when my checking account balance was more than 50K, due to my level of savings, they practically forced me to change to an interest-bearing account, arguing that I was \"losing money\". On average, they paid me a meagre interest of about 3 cents on 30K. They always addressed me opportunistically as their \"most valued customer\" (no wonder because they profited tremendously from my money balances). In recent months my money balances fell sharply to amounts well below 10K because I became unemployed.

I use my credit cards to build credit by monthly making purchases and paying them in a timely manner. I just got another 90 dollar Amazon gift card from Chase for paying off my monthly charges.

If you have cashed a check, the issuer can reclaim the check as if it were a fraud and file a claim. The issuer can file a claim up until two years is what I was told by the BofA agent. Meaning issuer can re-cash the already cleared check anytime in the next two years. BofA's claims department has the leverage of debiting that amount from your checking account without notifying you or at least they say they tired to reach you, which is false. My account has an email id, and they could have notified me via email. The bank has authorized the claims and XXX $ was debited from my checking account. Which ideally means, our accounts are an open book. I fought real hard, and all they have to say is I have to contact the issuer, and they will not help me. But they will take my money without my permission. How Convenient. What happen to their privacy and security.I strongly feel there are scammers inside this financial institution - Bank of America.I closed my BofA account and they immediately called my overseas number .

Then I receive the following month's statement with a $28 late fee which they refuse to refund. As it turns out I'm told both payments were put on the \"first month\", even though the second payment was 3 days after the first month due date. I'm told if the second payment would have been 1 day later than it would have been applied to the next month's statement.

First they said the refund would hit my checking account in 2-5 business days. Then they told me the refund would take longer to review.

While I expected a hold of some of the funds, I did not expect a hold on all $5,000. I have deposited personal checks at the same ATM and the funds were immediately released. According to FDIC policies, this practice is against federal law. My guess is that Bank of America holds the funds in order to gain interest. It does not take 12 days to verify a cashier's check. With today's technology, it's just a matter of either calling the issuer or using the database to search for the amount. I do not recommend Bank of America. How is it that a financial institution insured by the FDIC holds funds from another FDIC institution for an extended length of time. Below are the policies:Banks must post or provide a notice at each ATM location that funds deposited in the ATM may not be available for immediate withdrawal.If a bank makes funds from deposits at an ATM it doesn\u2019t own available for withdrawal later than funds from deposits at an ATM it does own, it must provide a description of how the customer can tell the difference between the two ATMs.If you deposit money in an ATM that isn\u2019t owned by your bank, the funds must be available for withdrawal not later than the fifth business day following the banking day on which the funds are deposited.Funds deposited at an ATM that is not on or within 50 feet of the premises of the bank are considered deposited on the day funds are removed from the ATM, if funds are not normally removed from the ATM more than two times each week.A bank that operates an off-premises ATM from which deposits are not removed more than two times each week must disclose at or on the ATM the days on which deposits made at the ATM will be considered received.Funds deposited at a staffed facility, ATM or contractual branch are considered deposited when they are received at the staffed facility, ATM or contractual branch.","3862":"My wife and I had been injured and could not work.

The checking account folks were terrible, the call took over an hour, and they struggled to find her address (the same one the credit card folks could send to!) in their system, eventually having to send it to a nearby address.

Overall, my experience with them as a creditor has been typical, save for one aspect: their poor customer service when calling in. I was prompted to close my checking and savings accounts with them due to this issue, as the bank simply was unwilling to stand by me as a customer when I disputed a charge that I should have been compensated for based on the circumstances, and this very same issue with their service standards is now prompting me to cut all three of my cards and never use the accounts again. All I wanted done was to have all three cards on a matching billing cycle to make payments easier for me. For some strange reason, their customer service reps refused to do so. I called on various occasions during the year about it and received the same poor result-the reps refused to update my billing cycle on just one card. When I kept persisting as to why, the latest rep simply transferred me to the collections department, as if I had or was going to pay late, though the bill was not even close to being due and would assuredly be paid in full! This kind of assumption is simply sad and shows how they feel about the majority of their account holders-delinquencies waiting to happen. I promptly explained this is not a collections matter and was given more of the same run around by two other reps transferring me here and there, doing basically nothing to really solve the issue nor explaining the reasons behind why the request could not be satisfied in any way that could be described as excellent service, something I've too often heard their reps describe as their aim. Sadly, this excellent service is just puff and smoke, a dream. Asking for a simple billing cycle change is such a basic and elementary request. If BOA can't even get that right, what hope is there and when I may need their support in the future, can I count on it? I think not. Very poor for such a large bank in one of the wealthiest countries in the world. ","2774":"I have an issue with BOA overdraft charges. I funneled a lot of money through this bank using my company account. I do seasonal work and making ends meet in the winter months are a little more difficult especially because I\u2019m working on getting the business off the ground and established. I\u2019ve been charged hundreds in overdraft charges and I\u2019ve never asked for a courtesy reversal on an overdraft fee. The one time I do ask I get denied.       So, I want to say that denying my request for a reversal was not a good business move on their end. If ya knew how much money I have funneled through this bank you would think the same. Say good bye to this customer. Ya lost a large account over a little money.","1164":"I have attempted three times to get myself added to my fathers account which I have a guardianship for, and take his sister off the account with a death certificate. I was given three different answers by three different associates at B of A. I was told they can't do this. I would have to open all new accounts and get all of my fathers direct deposits straight at social security. (Is this a STAT driven agenda) No one at the physical bank has answers. Everything goes through corporate legal. HORRIBLE customer service.","3863":"Age can be a cruel partner, especially when dealing with Bank Of America.

So i think a few characteristic excerpts will give you a fine idea\u2026 My Mother, suffering the devastating loss of her husband (who managed the household and all the bills) and rendered incapable of making any sort of financial decisions due to the advanced stage of Dementia and a brain tumor had all of her Social Security Monies stolen via fraudulently written checks.  As I awaited for doctors letters to activate my POA, My mothers checks were stolen and I went into the bank and asked them to freeze her account, not to take out money, not to see a balance just to report that I knew there was Fraud being committed and the monies that were disappearing was all my mothers Social Security Benefits.   I met with two different Bank executives, both of which did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!  I was ignored, my report ignored and the fraudulent abuse went on depleting the remaining funds of a dying woman. Later on it became clear that Bank of America is a band of unethical thieves, with zero accountability and for the most part supported an evil act of Elder Abuse.  And this my friends is when the fun really started. BOA clearly had no intention of paying my claim, hearing the facts or acknowledging their mistake, they played it off on another departments lack of responsibility and was kicked down the hallway to yet another department, over and over.It doesn\u2019t take much to understand that there is a certain technique of avoidance to wear the violated customer down. I had to prove my eligibility of being a POA, then as a Trustee, which they would not accept because they wanted me to Probate the Estate which under California Probate Code #13100 - 13115, there was no need for that.  I then sent medical records that stated that my mother was incapacitated for 5 years, her brain surgeon noted that she had been unable to deal with finances or write checks for this whole time period.   BofA, then said it was her signature, on dates that she was in the hospital having brain surgery\u2026  Shall we all just let that sink in.  In order to send BofA these documents you need to fax them not email.  In the 21st century\u2026 email still sounds futuristic in the halls of the mighty BOA. They take 48hours to be logged and acknowledged. When checking in to make sure that the fax had been received in the appropriate department they could not be located and the request to resend the 100 plus page document was repeated (4 times). \u2026Well, how often can one fax a telephone book without growing resentful?I have asked for accounting and statements, which has been ignored repeatedly.  I cannot tell you how disgusting BofA is to harm an incapacitated human living her desolate without money and never even attempting to get to the bottom of the claim - on a different note the perpetrators are being prosecuted for this crime - the police seemed to figure it out, but still BofA is in denial.","3864":"Applied for auto loan 2 months ago, nobody called me and every time I call they apology and said, \"Will update you sir,\" and again no call back and every time please upload documents and different issues, Really worst customer service ever I had.","3028":"Terrible customer service - I have been lied to multiple times and mislead throughout an entire month long process. A representative deliberately twisted my words, claimed I was lying and\/or uninformed several times, and was laughing during the process.

They have no respect for loyalty from customers and change policy without notice or explanation and leave customers to eat the cost. Disgusting.","3029":"I had a BOA account for 19 years.

I contested it in writing with facts and it was reinstated without any type of notice.\n\nTHIS COMPANY WILL NEVER TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ITS ACTIONS!  Look at their standard copy and paste robotic replies here! \n\nWhen you walk into a branch, you always wait in line before getting to a teller that obviously hates their job because I've never seen one smile.  I went to three different branches in one week last year with horrific service at each bank - long wait times, poorly staffed and uncaring employees.\n\nI received a notice I would be transferred from their wealth management group to a more localized bank (actually the furthest from my home) and may incur new fees.  When I finally went to close my account I found a person with a smile as she desperately tried to save my account.

This was back in August 2019. Bank of America left me in a financial hard ship on this weekend this fraudulent charge took place. It happened over a holiday weekend. My money was temporarily returned to my account in 10 days. I have spent so much time trying to get this resolved speaking to numerous Associates, taking time to go into the bank and now Bank of America is making me pay for a transaction I did not authorize. They have pulled the money out of my account and I got hit with over draft fees caused by their error. My transactions for my bills are bouncing and now I am having to pay insufficient funds for those transactions made before Bank of America withdrew money from my account.

In our case, only the doctor can order the deposit books. So he either has to go to the bank, login online (and he's not the most savvy online person) or be on hold for 20 minutes waiting for a customer service rep. I can't believe how hard this bank makes it for us to put money INTO our account. I am pushing hard for us to move our account to another bank, one with better hours, and better service.

Hello, Have you ever lost your credit card and feared for your financial future? This is not your typical story about credit card fraud. Let\u2019s start the story at the Houston Police Head Quarters in downtown Houston. This experience started with the routine metal detector and waiting time that you might experience in any government building. Initially, I went to file a police report for a current fraud case with Bank of America, but after the procedural forms and Police Report I wanted more.","3031":"I have been a member of BoA for 22 years. \n\nBank of America (BoA) staff mishandled and miscommunicated handlings of reimbursement of $10k+ owed to me. This involved 4 customer service representatives, two customer service managers and an AVP of customer service.\n\nI requested reimbursement of funds mid November. I was told that I would have it within 2-5 business days to the bank account of my choosing.\n\n9 days passed and the fund were not deposited in the designated bank account. I contact BoA and the customer service representative mentioned that I would not have it for two billing cycles because the first representative processed it incorrectly. I requested that it be fixed, as I needed fund for bills. They enrolled a manager, who then said it would be corrected and I would be have funds in 48 hours.\n\n2 days later the funds were shown to be removed from BOA and sent somewhere but it was not in the designated bank account. I contacted the other bank a day later and they confirmed that BoA sent nothing. I emailed and called the customer service manager that was handling the matter and asked for him to confirm it went to the designated account and when I will have it. He said I should have it.\n\n3 more days passed, I still did not have my funds from BoA in my designated bank account. I contact the manager again and he said he would look into it and ask the escalation team and get back to me but he would be able to tell me that day. So I called the customer service number and got another customer service representative and their manager to look into where my money went. They said it went to the designated account and should be there in 3 days, that the other manager did not expedite the reimbursement.\n\n3 more days pass (20 days from my original request) and I still do not have my $10k+. I keep emailing and calling the customer service manager that was originally supposed to resolve it. After several attempts he finally emails me back and says that he's still waiting to hear from the escalation team. I ask him if he has tried to call that team, or if there is a supervisor he can get help from - I got no response.\n\nAt this point my other creditor's bills are starting to bounce. I decided to call the customer service number again because the manager was not providing the information I needed and had no sense of urgency on the matter.\n\nOnce I got a hold of another customer service representative, I explained the situation and that I had already filed 2 complaints, and that I need to speak with someone higher than the customer service manager that was not acting effectively. She went to send me right back to that same manager. I pushed to talk with someone higher. \n\nI finally got an AVP on the line, which told me that my funds left their bank 2 days after my second request, and was sent to a creditor other than the designated bank that BoA kept telling me on a recorded line and via email that my money would go to and went to. He said that I'd need to contact the creditor to get my funds back and that BoA did make some errors and it was a coaching opportunity for them. But basically, now they can't help me - I have to contact the creditor?!?\n\nI look at the creditor account and no payment for $10k+ is made to my account. I call the creditor and they could not locate it off the bat. The money is in limbo. I have opened a service investigation ticket with the creditor and will not hear back for at least 2 days. In the meantime, steps I took to clean up my credit are now ruining my credit due to BoA's mis-handling\/miscommunication, etc. \n\nThis is more than a \"coaching opportunity\" for BoA. I have worked in finance for 20+ years (Credit Unions, Banks and Mortgage) and this is unacceptable. I will report them to every agency I can, as I am still currently out my $10k, they are no longer helping, and this should never happened in banking. \n\n","3866":"This bank was unable to help when we really needed their support. My husband & me paid $560.99 using BOC credit card to one of the most fraudulent online ticketing agency for a rental car hoping to use during our last vacation abroad, but we could not get the service at all. The ticketing company denied to back our money even though we did not use the service. Then we asked help from the bank. For the first time, they easily resolve in favor to this fraudulent online company. We again requested & gave the all evidences & communication records that we had about this transaction to reopen.","2779":"I have an auto loan with Bank of America.  Today I tried to contact them about an issue with my auto loan.  I have been waiting for a real 'associate' for 23 minutes, which is a considerable waste of my time.

Every day, driving your account negative into the 100s. Call customer support and they won't do a damn thing for you to help. Was in the process of switching banks, had my account charged for two bills I didn't change over, overdrafted and got charged four 35$ fees... account was negative 400$. Got my check and finally made it back into the green. Wake up the next morning, negative 65$ again! went to the branch and the teller tells me \"you didn't deposit money before midnight so it charged you again.\" are you insane!!!! needless to say I closed all my accounts and will never be going back. I'm with Chime now, which is 10000x better, and they're online only. Stay the hell away from this bank! bunch of thieves! pissing your money away.","1486":"After couple of years rebuilding my credit, Bank of America was the first to trust me with this kind of credit card.

I called the # on the machine (REMOVED BY BBB), was on hold for about 5 minutes, and gave the machine # (REMOVED BY BBB). I explained it was a business account and business checks. The machine was rebooted. I was told that the card may eject during the re-boot process (approximately 5 minutes), and was transferred to another customer service dept. while waiting. But, the card did not eject. I waited about 10 minutes, and the machine rebooted and was back online. However, ATM customer service had already transferred me to another customer service dept, so I left, as I was now late for an appointment. The appointment was to deliver my co-worker's donations to an animal shelter, and it was closing. \n\n\nI held for about 15 -20- minutes and I was told they were personal accounts and couldn't help me and transferred me to business customer service. The menu referenced ACH and nothing else, so I held, as I was driving. This wait was also about 20 minutes. This department verified my identity, told me they only handle back end ACH claims and said they would transfer me to business customer service. I asked if I would have to go through the same process of verifying identity (I was driving, so difficult) and they said I would not, and that I would not have to verify identity, and would be directly transferred.\n\n\nOf course, this did not happen. After a 40 minute wait, someone came on the line, supposedly to help. But, at this point, I just arrived at the shelter appointment. I asked them to hold, because I could not start over again.\n\n\nSo, this person asked for my identify to be verified again, heard the story AGAIN, and told me they would submit the claim and a complaint on my behalf. Jeannie gave me the service request #: REMOVED BY BBB and told me to call REMOVED BY BBB to follow up on both the deposit and the card. She said these claims are expedited and taken seriously. She said she could re-issue the card, but there is a $15 fee that I would just need to call and dispute. Really? No thanks. I have spent more time on BoA's faulty equipment and incompetent personnel than on my own business today.\n\nDecember 3\n\n\nThis morning, I received an email that there is a message on my account. This message said the issue was closed, but no detail. It said to call ************** for details. I called. They said they could not help with this type of claim. I have been on hold now for 17 minutes to REMOVED BY BBB. Seriously?!?!?!\n\n\nI realize BoA is a large organization and does not care at all about my business, but this is truly unbelievable. Also, that ATM is out of commission about 50% of the time and should be replaced. I cannot wait to switch to another bank as soon as I have time. I have 2 personal accounts, one for 30 years) and two business accounts that process 2.5M a year, and I realize that is small to BoA, and that no one there cares. But I am a small, woman-owned business and 24 people count on these deposits to be paid.\n\n\nStill on the phone after 36 minutes and have been told that no claim was filed. **** \n\n\nWas told the card would be re-issued and that the checks would be investigated within the next few days. I said that was unacceptable and needed to happen NOW. Supposedly, it is now expedited again and I should hear back. Can't believe I actually had to ask for it to be expedited. That should have been offered up front.\n\n\nI said I don't believe I will hear back and was given the deposit specialist # to call if I don't. REMOVED BY BBB We'll see. I don't have high hopes.\n\n\nIf I ran my business the BoA does, I would be out of business. And, I may be driven out of business by BoA not depositing my checks and taking up 5 hours of my time for a machine that they should not even have in operation. About 50-75% of the time, when I go to that location, there is a repairman working on the ATM. I have tried going into the banking center and have been told to go the machine as it is faster and in a condescending way, told how to use the machine. \n\n\nSo, BoA, do you have a recommendation for a good bank that cares about their small, women-owned businesses?\n\nDecember 4\nWell, here we are the next day, and still no resolution, as promised.  I am on a 29-minute hold with the deposit specialist line: REMOVED BY BBB.\nLove that BoA advertises that they help women-owned business.  What a joke.\n","3868":"On 11\/29\/19 I noticed a charge on my account which I didn't authorize. Immediately called the Fraud Department cancelled the debit card and did reissue new card.

This is the only money that I receive once a month and this is my lively hood how I survive eat and pay my bills with this money. About 3 months ago I noticed that my account would always mysteriously overdraft at first I thought that it was just be not keeping track of my money until I watched my spending very closely and it still would overdraft. I called the bank a young lady took a look at my account and noticed that *Amazon Prime* would cause my account to overdraft and had been doing so for almost 7 months. She got me over to the dispute department I waited on hold for an hour and a half and a man picked up I repeated to him the problem and he said in a smart way \"you don't have an amazon account\" as if I were lying I again told him no I am 77 years old I have no clue what Amazon prime is he then said well I am going to get Amazon on the line and I need to hear them say it I said fine he then called Amazon on the other line and we waited about 15 mins for them to get on the line needless to say they could not find an account with my name they asked me a phone number and email address neither had worked. Someone had opened an account fraudulently with my bank card information I then asked Bank of Americas representative did he hear that and what was the next step. He however was not on the line he had transferred me over to Amazon and had hung up I was in disbelief how unprofessional and mean he was I then called bank of America back and was on hold yet another hour and a half. This time I spoke with a young lady she was very nice gave me numbers and let me know I had been out of $202 including $12.99 every month for 6 months and $124.00 in overdraft fees and assured me that she let me know she would dispute these transactions for me and would get me my funds back to me I was thankful. I was giving my money back and went on with life as I knew. On 11\/26 I got a letter in the mail that said these charges where in fact authorized and that they would deduct $90.93 from my account on 11\/29 including any other transactions associated with this dispute I couldn't believe that they told me I opened this account when I in fact did not and was sure I \"proved\" that to them by calling Amazon. I then immediately called them and let them know again that they were NOT authorized the lady on the phone let me know that she would reopen the case and everything would be fine. On 12\/1 I called to check my balance because my nurse would be coming to take me the grocery store and my account was negative -$17.32. Bank of America had token my SSI (which by the way is against the law to be touched) they had take $12.99 6 times had $105.00 on hold $2.50 (overdraft fees) I was so hurt and confused I called the bank on 11\/30 and a man had let me know that the $12.99 transactions would take some time I would have to talk to the dispute department on Monday 12\/2\nBut I would get my money back today 12\/2.

I called and was told I would have to cancel the original card and pay a fee to have the card expressed if I wanted it in time. Something I would have done from the beginning of the information I head been given was accurate.","2782":"Bank of America is by far the worst bank I have ever had to endure depending on.Their online telephone service does not work:1. When calling online support, it asks to confirm a code it sends to my mobile while I wait on the phone. The code never arrives before half a hour elapsed.2. Due to a special arrangement our agreement reads no \"ATM fees\". ATM refers to automatic teller machine. This also refers to credit cards, see bank rates dot com, glossary, for the definition on atm cards. Yet, on a regular basis they charge an arm and a leg for fees. In total over the course of three months, fees amounted to over 200 dollars. Total rip off. I mean, banks just shift numbers through computer systems, yet US banks take three days to make a payment appear on an account. Guess what they do in the mean time with YOUR money? The invest it elsewhere in large sums and profit from interest.3. Each time then I have to call the bank to actually get my fees back that were illegally deducted from my account, or accept to be defrauded. Go back to step 1 to see how that works.","2783":"Bank of America is the worst I had created a accident online got my card direct deposit set up then they go and close my account talking about I need to Verify my identity so I go to the bank to verify my identity and we get all that situated there in about a week later create another account online since they close my other account set up the direct deposit again and got my card in the mail and then my account got closed again I called ask them why my account got closed they did not wanna verify or tell me why my Account got close my was supposed to get paid the day they close my account so I have to wait another 23 weeks to get money and it\u2019s the holidays I\u2019m beyond Mad can\u2019t have access to no money have to Waite another 2 weeks to get money by them my bills will be over due I\u2019m so sick of this bank","3871":"This bank's interest rate is well above the national average. I experienced an uninitiated increase in my credit line and at a time when I transferred some of my balance to save interest, my credit line was reduced drastically, adversely affecting my credit standing. I also did not receive a complete credit agreement and was unaware of many of their policies.","3872":"This is the worst bank and worst customer service available. I filed a fraud charge on my account and they acted like they were trying to help. Without notification they denied the claim and assessed $315 in charges for themselves on my account. Was told when I called that she could not explain the additional charges and to look in my message center. Still no explanation for the additional charges. Changing back to Chase Bank. Looking at the fees since 2014 I am astonished and should have paid more attention sooner. This should be illegal.","3036":"Their customer service gave me false information in regards to a payment I had made using their app. They told me no such issues were going to prevent the payment from being applied, even though for over a week they had not deducted the payment. My personal bank said there was no such attempt to deduct a payment from Bank of America. The next day Bank of America charged my a return check fee, but could not give me a reason as to why. My personal bank account had more than enough funds for the payment and again after calling my bank they said no such attempt from Bank of America was made for the payment. \n\nI was told by Bank of America there was nothing they would be willing to do about the fee. They refused to take any blame or investigate why their website and iPhone app were saying payments were being accepted but then being reversed. I have no recourse of action because my personal bank has no record of the payment being attempted to be deducted from my bank account and Bank of America refuses to tell my anything other than they will charge me a fee. \n\nTheir customer service will not tell you the truth or be knowledgeable enough to do anything other than tell you what you can see on the website yourself. \n\nThey simply charge you a fee after not being truthful and steal your money without any remorse. \n","2784":"THIS IS THE WORST BANK AND WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE AVAILABLE.

They have constantly changed account standings, settings, and issue fees even though my account was well above the threshold for these. This required me to have a monthly call with BoA to get them to refund the fees and each time I was told that it would not happen in the future but that it is the \"systems call\" whether or not changes and fees are issued; in other words, you will be charged a fee regardless of whether or not your account meets the minimum requirements for the fees to be waived. It seems that the \"system\" does this simply to be an inconvenience to you - each time I called the BoA customer service I have had to wait 15+ minutes on the phone and the callback feature does not work often either. I also have a Small Business Account with BoA; again, it more than meets the minimum requirements for all fees to be waived, yet each month I am charged a fee which I have to call to get reimbursed. I have made in-person meetings at my local branch, and while the agents have been very helpful, it seems that they don't entirely know how the BoA system works. This is surprising as they were unable to answer some of my basic questions, including why the system charges fees when the account is above the threshold. Overall, after 8+ years I have had enough of poor customer service where each agent says something different and seemingly no one understands how the system works and I have had enough of a broken system that charges its users fees regardless of whether or not they meet the threshold for the fees to be waived. Since I will be leaving BoA, I will be pulling my Small Business Account and have also had my partners and employees switch to the other bank where our Small Business Account moved to.

I even made a payment over the phone to pay the balance, thinking this would work for the moment. Later I received and email saying this one did not go through, (issue was supposed to have been fixed already). Once again I was on the phone with long waiting times to fix the issue again.

I pushed the issue quite hard, and was told that I would have to contact a specialist in regards to that. A few days I the inquiry was removed days later. They did well when I ask them to remove the in returned fee and finance charge. Needless to say I closed the account as soon as I could. \nMy comments to the CEO train your people to run a tight ship, the customer service was awful (ie,, being transferred from one department to the next.

They did not care at all nor did they try and assist me in trying to solve this issue . They are just trying to strong arm me into paying another 4500 dollars.

So now there are two charges of just under 400 dollars each on my credit.\n\nI called BoA the next morning when they opened and they informed me I would need to call ******** to get this rectified or wait until it was finished pending to dispute the transaction. I called ******** when they opened and they advised that they could not cancel the duplicate order.\n\nI called BoA again and, instead of correcting their mistake, they told me I would just have to wait until I receive the duplicate item and waste my time and gas to go to the store to return it. When I asked why they couldn't just decline the purchase they initially declined, the customer service rep informed me that it was because ******** retried the charge. \nAgain, I'm not sure why they allowed this duplicate charge to go through when they initially declined it. In any case, they refused to take responsibility for this or to help me resolve this at all and instead I have to waste MY time and money to get this corrected.\n\nThanks BoA, for wasting my already precious little time.","1091":"Possibly the worst major bank around.

The first of which is when I opened a Business Account with them, the business banking associate who was 'helping' me informed me that my client was only hiring me for a tax write off...\n\nThe second complication was when I was at a store purchasing something with my personal debit card (a different account) and my card was declined. I saw that there was an unauthorized transaction on my account, which led to my personal account being overdraft, so I called the fraud department. \n\nThrough a lengthy conversation with 2 different associates, it was determined that the fraudulent transaction was actually BANK OF AMERICA! I was later informed that my Business Checking had gone into overdraft--which I was not aware of. Then they decided (WITHOUT INFORMING ME OR ASKING ME IF I'D LIKE TO MAKE PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS) to take money from my PERSONAL account to satisfy my BUSINESS account which completely rendered both accounts useless to me. \n\nI found it completely unacceptable that they would make such a decision without informing the customer. I have a right to know and plan. When I spoke about it with the customer service agent, she informed me that they couldn't reverse the transaction and allow me to make payments on the business debt. They had no remorse, lacked professionalism, and were completely out of line. \n\nIf something of this magnitude is procedure, the customer MUST BE MADE AWARE in advance!

This is not only consumer unfriendly but also a total scam. I needed some funds transferred after many similar transactions over a 25 year period, and they placed a ridiculous 9 day hold on those funds so they could profit from what they would earn by holding the amount.

My husband and I were mailed debit cards he got his pin number I didn't. So I had to call customer service and request one because you apparently don't get to pick your own pin number... They said it would take 7-10 business days to get a pin number so with that being said my account was absolutely useless beings I couldn't even activate my card without a pin number so the account sat idle for a while. I finally get the pin number in the mail and I set up my mobile banking app and set up my direct deposit and I also got an insurance check in the mail for 1700 bucks.

If you need help, you can't call customer service to speak with an associate. The voice machine only gives you certain options. If you don't answer what it wants, it hangs up on you. If you will download the app, then you can actually speak with someone. I did not want the app. I have too many apps on my phone already. Why couldn't I just call?!!Secondly, they have the highest interest rate of all of my credit cards. When I was able to speak with someone, they refused to lower the rate. So, I will only charge a little once in a while and pay it off immediately so it doesn't cancel and hurt my credit.Also, I requested old statement copies and was told they would be mailed to me. When they didn't show up a week later, I called back and was told that they had not been ordered. Supposedly, that associate would order them for me and they would be mailed out the next day. I called the next day to ensure that they had been ordered and mailed. They hadn't. When I called the third time, I was told again that the associate would request them that day. I'm waiting to see how many more times I need to contact Bank of America. Next time it will be in writing so that it can be proven that their customer service people are not doing their jobs or that there is something wrong with their system.Also, at one point, the voice machine wanted me to give my credit card last four numbers which I did. Then it said that it didn't recognize my phone No. I have used the same phone No. for years.I checked and it is was on record at Bank of America.

In other words, \u201cYou\u2019re powerless and we at BOA couldn\u2019t care less.\u201d Then it dawned on me.

I specifically called this ranch to find out if I could verify whether I could cash a check from someone whose previous check bounced. I had to call and wait on hold for almost 30 minutes because no one ever picks up the phone (though you would be much better off if they never did and disconnected their phones). I explained the scenario precisely, and that I do not have an account there, and was told to bring in the checks and my ID, and that they could tell me in person (not the balance of the account of course, but whether it would cover the checks so I would not continue to be charged for bounced checks).\nI traveled a half hour each way to go to the Telegraph Avenue branch because of their instructions--I spent a half hour in advance precisely to insure I wasn't wasting my time going to the branch.  When I arrived, the teller said she could not provide this information, but I could pay to have them try to cash the check. When I told her this is not remotely what I was informed, I was passed on to another person, who overtly lied to my face and gave me offensive excuses, and when I specified what I was told, passed me on to a manager, assuring me she would be able to provide the information. After I waited a total of at least 20 minutes, the manager went back to square one and told me the same absolute gibberish I had been told before. No one here takes any responsibility, not just for what the bank's employees say or do, but even for their own actions. It s beyond belief that they have a single customer.\n","2165":"Horrible.

Unfortunately, the payment was sent to the wrong address. I contacted Bank of America, and changed the address & asked them to reissue another check. Sadly, the change was never updated and an additional check was issued to another wrong address. After communicating with the preschool, two weeks later, the checks had still not arrived. Another check was issued, this time with the correct address, but it was expected to arrive a month after the payment due date. I requested another check be mailed using overnight service & a refund of a $50 late fee was issued by the bank, since the preschool was no longer patiently waiting for their payment. The check arrived the following day, so I thought my concerns with Bank of America were resolved. Unfortunately, a week later, my online bill pay account experienced some dramatic failures. I have alerts set up on my account, to be sent to the same email address that has been active on my account since I opened it 15 years ago. The alerts are for when money is transferred into my account & when my account is overdrawn. I did not receive any of those alerts to my email. This is the first time this has ever happened. I was charged $70 for overdrawn items. After contacting Bank of America and speaking with two supervisors, they were only willing to refund one overdrawn fee, despite making false statements about the accuracy of my email address and the accuracy of the alerts set up on the accounts. They claimed that alerts that had been set up on my account for many years were not active, despite receiving one through my mobile app the morning of the dispute. I\u2019m concerned that the overall accuracy of my account has been compromised. There unwillingness to refund the charges, when obviously strange and unaccounted for discrepancies happened, is not only disappointing and upsetting, but the lack of accountability from Bank of America is shameful. I was charged late fees for discrepancies solely related to bank errors. They claim that since the bills were paid in full, with no late fees (this time) that they were not willing to issue any further refunds. I have been a customer for 15 years, never had any issues as dramatic and upsetting as this & the lack of customer support is disgusting.

I opened the account back in April however, did not receive the redemption email until early September. The wait time was longer than originally stated. Afterwards, I was eager to redeem my iPad. After receiving the iPad, I opened the box to find out it was a refurbished, not in brand new condition with Bank of America's branch apps preset on it. I was very displeased with believing that I signed up for a brand new iPad however, received a used one that had marks on it. I called Bank of America's customer service to request a replacement. I was given the return label and shipped the iPad back. The associate on the phone told me that once they received the iPad they would ship out the new iPad within 3-5 business days. However, I waited weeks yet there was no shipping confirmation from Bank of America in regards to the new iPad. I had to call their customer service line multiple times, and followed up myself in regards to the tracking for the new iPad. I waited over a month since they received the refurbished iPad to receive the new tracking. However, once again they sent me another refurbished iPad again. If Bank of America is unable to provide a brand new iPad then they should not be running this promotion stating that the client will be given a brand new item. This can easily be seen as a scam against the consumer having them open checking accounts so they can reach their quotas. If I can provide a 0 stars for the level of satisfaction I would.

First of all, it took forever to set up automatic payments for my Bank of America credit card. I had to set up an appointment with an advisor at the bank, go there and fill out a form to set them up. The advisor then sent the form to set up the automatic payments and it took a whole month to set them up.","2169":"Around the dates of February to March, as well as May, August, and September I have dealt with multiple frauds claims with Bank of America. It started in February where $18,945.00 was taken fraudulently out of my checking account from multiple locations across the U.S and even in other countries. It totaled over 250+ transactions. Even when I called Bank of America customer service fraud department at the very same time we were on the phone and I was explaining the panic I was in and frustration of what I was seeing on my account there were still transactions being made. I have filed a police report with my local police department and Bank of America has closed my claim over three times. Every time they closed it they stated \u201cthe transaction were made with verification\u201d . I am furious because the money came from a lawsuit of something very traumatic that happened to me. I trusted Bank of America with all of my funds and they guaranteed me that money is insured when it comes to fraud. Not only that but according to equifax my social security and all of my information was breached and that lead to the compromising of my bank account. Even after my first fraud claim with Bank of America I moved all my money into a separate private account with them and replaced my debit card and I STILL AM CONTINUING TO HAVE MONEY TAKEN FRAUDULENTLY OUT OF MY ACCOUNT! In may I was constantly having money taken out of my account from the PlayStation Network which I do not own anything affiliated with PlayStation. In August through September i have multiple transactions from PayPal taken off my account totaling over 2k+ . This is ridiculous I have had over 8 debit cards from Bank of America this entire year ! I still have not received my money back from first fraud claim and Bank of America is doing nothing to help me as one of their \u201cPlatinum Honor Client\u201d.","1340":"It\u2019s a good card and worth considering.

They are not about customer service.  Today I went into my nearest branch after I spent almost two hours on the phone trying to resolve a problem with a transfer that didn't go through.  I guess I was crazy to think that by going to the branch office they would help me.  What I found was NO CUSTOMER SERVICE at all.  A BOA employee could not even take me into an office to hear my problem; she kept me out in the lobby in front of other customers asking why I was there.  When I told her, she said she could not help me and that all she could do was take me to an office and dial a number for me.  I asked if she could stay with me until I reached the proper person, and she so much as said it would be a waste of her time. The branch had at least 5 people who didn't at all seem busy, so why no help?  As soon as I can change banks, I will.  This was not the first time I have had problems with BOA.","3057":"I signed up for an online Bank of America checking account. They requested my debit card to make the deposit, so my actual money is linked to this checking account. One day after signing up, I got an email saying I had changed my Bank of America passcode. I HADN'T. So naturally, I was alarmed.\n\nI called Bank of America and talked to four different representatives before a very hateful person came on the phone and basically demanded that I go to the nearest Bank of America branch (2 hours from me, so a 4 hour drive total) and verify my identity with two forms of ID. First of all, you allowed a complete stranger to change my passcode this morning! That's not MY fault. It's your security's fault. So it's a simple matter of, I am a severely disabled woman who cannot make this four hour journey to verify my identity. I offered to send identity through mail. She very curtly explained that they can't accept forms by mail. No problem: CLOSE MY ACCOUNT.\n\nShe refused to close the account and still, even after hearing that I am severely disabled and unable to go in person to verify my identity, refused to close the account. That's terrifying. It's a simple matter of because of your allowing someone to change my passcode, someone who wasn't me, now you're saying that I have to drive 4 hours so that I can do business with you? NO THANKS. \n\nI plan to seek legal advice on how to get this account closed. I have complete and total control over my financial life. I don't have to do business with you if I don't want. I answered question after question verifying my identity. I offered to do photo IDs through mail. If you don't want to accept that, that's fine, but I have a right to close my account! And the scariest part is, you allowed someone who ISN'T ME to change the passcode on me, but you're punishing someone who had planned to do banking with you by demanding they drive four hours just to get your terrifying banking services.\n\nJust to review here: One day in Bank of America had already had someone who isn't me change my passcode. One day in. I hadn't even got my debit card or checks yet. Then they demanded I drive for hours and hours just to verify my identity, even though apparently a complete stranger has more of a right to any of my financial information and accounts than I do. Finally, I'm horrified that this bank has my debit card information (I used it to make the initial deposit of $25). I am going to have to get a lawyer to close the account. Absolutely stunned that this bank treated me like a complete criminal for trying to start an account with them, even though these people had my account hacked within 24 hours of signing up for the account. Scary stuff.\n\nSTAY AWAY FROM BANK OF AMERICA.","3058":"BOFA sent me a letter saying they dont have a location in my area with a identification code telling me that i could just open an account online. So i do just that. i open an acct online because they dont have any location within like 75 miles of me. they send me and my wife a debit card and i turn in my direct deposit forms in to my employer. i go to log into to my acct and it says im locked out to call. i call and the guy tells me that i couldnt be verified online so they just shut the acct down. they gave me no phone call or anything. they tell me that i have to come in and bring 2 forms of id to which i reply that they sent a letter to ME they initiated this whole thing and there nowhere close to where i live. that bank just wasted 3 hours of my time. now i have to go through all of it again with a new bank. the employess could care less about why im frustrated. very bad experience. if there not in your area dont waste your time because there gonna try and make u come in even though they know u dont live anywhere near them","3059":"Bank of America is a joke. That's the simple way of putting it, but I'm going to delve more into it. Charging you overdraft fees for miniscule transactions (I'm talking 2 cents and they'll charge you $35.00 for it). Their customer service is useless, you'd find better luck asking some rando on the street for advice on your account than you would from calling them. Not to mention, their hold times are always ridiculously long, because they want to deter you from calling in and use their ugly, useless, trash UI\/UX APP. You never get the same answer, you'll be told one thing in the branch and another thing over the phone, make up your mind! \n\nThey place holds on checks and then charge you overdraft fees in the time being, ruining your other finances, and giving you some bs excuse so they can collect interest off of you.

Holy crap man WTH!!!!!???

BOA also charged me $70 in fees for the 2 payments because they held the check. (Again, I have been a customer for 20 years and have never deposited a check that was returned.) In addition, since 2 of my transaction were returned, I sustained an additional $140 in late fees from my mortgage company and other merchant for the returned items.My recommendation is that you bank local where I have found that you are more than just an account #. Especially after 20 years.","1349":"Bank of America is holding a check I deposited at a Bank of America ATM for seven business days despite the fact that the payor is a known and credit worthy payor and I am a multi decade customer in good standing. I spent 25 minutes on the phone with a supervisor pleading my case because I have checks drawn against this deposit and still the bank is withholding the entire amount of the check. Apparently the law requires at least $2,000 be credited if the payor bank is a local bank which it is. Basically B of A is using scare tactic of money laundering risk as an excuse to earn extra fees by holding on to customers' funds. Another way for the bank to profit from the float on their customers' accounts and forcing customers to use overdraft or draw on HELOCs. This is so unethical. I am going to look for another bank.","1348":"HORRIBLE!! They keep stealing money out of my account, little by little, thinking I don\u2019t notice? I could have 30$ in my account.

In their initial letter they said that my 800+ FICO score put me in the top 1% of applicants. They later withdrew the approval because they \"couldn't verify my phone number\". This is a cell phone I've had for approximately 20 years, one that I've used in every bank financial transaction\/loan I've ever entered into. BOA should be given credit for responding to the two rounds of letters I wrote to bank representatives, but they gave me no believable reason why a person would be refused such a small loan because of a phone number. It should also be noted that I had a BOA Mastercard from 1994-2014 with a perfect payment record so they knew that I had a flawless credit history. It was a very disappointing experience with BOA and I won't be doing business with them again.Eileen Stow, Ohio","4086":"I made my first late payment with BoA, which happened to be one day late.

I deposited into the atm...KNOWING there would be a PARTIAL hold...the remainder of the funds are usually released within 3 business days (remember I've been a member for 20yrs)..To my surprised they held the entire check!! This is a business check, not a personal check! I went inside to speak to the MOD to see if she could pull the check..noo, she wanted to go back and forth with me about the screen telling me that there will be a hold placed on it and do i want to continue..i informed her that it did not because if it did, we both would not be sitting right here having this discussion..so I called customer svc to see if anything could be done, why did customer sevc know and acknowledge that atm deposits DO NOT inform you of a hold until AFTER the transaction is done - of which she also told me they are working to get this fixed!!..TUH!!...All and all i explained to the MOD that this was bill money and i seriously needed access to it or me and my kids will be in the dark come Monday morning...she pretty much said forget your situation..funny thing is their was already an atm guy working on their outside atm, would it have been too much (since she claimed she couldn't open the atm) to call the guy who could open it inside, grabbed my check, verify it with the bank and then release my funds?? Even more funnier...my check was wrote againt Wells Fargo which sit right next to BOA!!

And it keeps on and on with the unbelievable stuff happening.Last week match.com charged my card for the 3rd months after i try cancelling on the 2nd month and they charged it regardless. Then i called the bank but the bank just was on the phone but didnt do anything to stop the charges. The 3rd time match.com charged again i called them and the bank tellers were telling me that i complaint too much and because of that my account will b closed. I said to those tellers ( 3 of them because i had to hang up and talk to someone else when the first social case answered me). I said clearly:\" i did not authorise you or any teller or this bank at no point to close my account based of your judgement. You are my bank. Do your job and do not make decisions for me based on your like and dislike of my complaint level. You are soooo unprofessional, arrogant and incorrect. How dare are you negating my experience and how you think you are doing your job as a bank.\". I felt so mad and disrespected by this bank and its no good tellers that answered my app call. NO GOOD when it comes to getting phone help. It really feels like someone when to a mental hospital and said:\" u look well!  You look well! Come with me! You are hired! Nothing wrong with being sick. If you are you are. Get well. Dont attack my life and my being through a bank system. You truly no good who ever you are.I cannot begin to tell the amount of unbelievable comments these tellers think they can tell to the customers or may be just me. It has to be. This cannot be a business here! If they do what i experienced to everyone for real this bank would no be operating a year total. And its been around so im assuming this is specially targeted to me.I explained to teller what i authorized you was to get me back my money someone try to steal by telling me something and doing something else. It s not a contract but a trial. I tried i didnt like. Willingly paid a month, camcelled and then keep 1month, 2 months charging so no! These tellers were definitely not normal people. They were so professionally off. They had no idea  how to professionalky help a customer. The 3rd one was literally acting like a kid repeating something on top of me like i win you loose game you play with a five years old and being overtalked. I m thinking in the back of my head: \"Who the hell hired and trained the 1st and 3rd person i spoke to?\" The 1st and 2nd phone rep definitely should be fired and not work in customer servive. The 3rd one was confirming agressively that he will close my account for complaining.  Did they even listen to themselves to be threatening a customer to close their account because they have complained 1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 he counted over the phone!!! Are you kidding me??? I regretted right at that moment using this bank for a decade and running my cards with them for 2500 to 5000 a month in small transactions.Who says such thing to your customer even if someone tells u to say it, u should not. And i surely will not be quiet just because u want me to not talk about a thief of my money or fear complaining because you may close my account. \"I will sue you if you do\" was what i said to this 3rd aggressive and disrespectful teller and all the other 2. Im even wondering if you are working with the thieves im complaining about. Is there a back end transaction stealing program by reps or the bank at this bank of america. You surely are not acting normal at all about my money being taken by a merchant. Whom even if u think i complained i ve called the bank twice for it already so it should have been stopped first time. Are you facilitating the subscription robery now! Why else would u act as such. Are you a rep for the bank who should represent the customer but clearly you were not and seem to defend the merchant who took my money 3rd times without stopping! So i complaint to bank to return my charge the 2nd time but they let the 3rd charge happen. Now i think even more this is on purpose. If i wasn't clear before im clear by calling and complaining of the charge the 3rd time. Why the 3rd charge after a 2nd complaint? Was your job to ignore my complaints!? In the meantime i work very hard. I have no one who helps me and you want to take my hard working money and sush me. No BOA. So fast foward i received a voicemail threat to attack my social AFTER THAT 3RD TELLER CRAZY INTER ACTION and few days later some dude Devin from Newark Delaware answer my call after the bank said to call from my bank of america  app. ( same name as the yelp dude who call me that morning too. They also use the code BOA. How they steal my business mony taking from my account to yelp advertising to advertise my business and steal the leads).  This dude was acting like he was trying to see how naive i was or not. He seemed to be doing something he wasnt supposed to. He was like this call is recorded and then was worried someone else was listening to our conversation. Its recorded you said. Someonevwill listen to it!  Why would you worry someones hearing what your disrespectful judgemental and crazym saying to me??? You know you are crossing your boundaries beyong and not doing what you are supp He said a check was deposited.  ts not me but its supposed to be my fiancee. But i dont take checks. Just wire transfer. So there its a lie. Basically they were doing what they said the following week. Closing your account for not doing their jobs and me complaining when they didnt. Reminder i used them for over a decade and never did them wrong. Out of all those year, they disrespect you for 8 uber complaints ( we all know how uber doesnt show sometimes and mess ur money up). There were 8 complaints she said out of 8000 times of using my card and $900 a month uber. Do you even know math as a banker? Aparrently not! Your focus and disrespect show it.Im a business owner. I made something great but crooks in Newark NJ wanted it. I said no. They send men to seduce me so they can access the bank assets and i rip their heart out each time and feed it to the evil queen alter ego of mine and send them back to the darkness they come from lol. Now the question is the disciple they have when doing shady violations in bank do i eat their hearts out too? Are they complices or just innocent people being duped by these newark delaware people trying to steal my stuff?  This is the big question\ud83d\udc78 Ill find out soon. Those tellers were not normal. They were sooo off and saying things a bank doesnt say but people who work for 3rd party would. Its like when the nigerian scammers call to intimidate you about your information. Its stupid.They think i dont know whats going on. I ride with the happening to see where it goes and determine the source of the problem. Few people in Deleware and Newark who have the nerve to try claiming what i made, designed and created from scratch working 19hrs a day for decades, paying for school, bills and holding 2 jobs was also what i did to be able to make my company until it comes to life. And now these lazy bratzs dare to want to scoop the benefits. If you think messing with my bank account or having uncompetent or crazy people in a bank will help you access my assets be sure i will sue u til the end of time and drag u to the mud newark. Why? because its mine. Not yours. Its my make, my idea, my compay and my money. I dont care what trick u try to use to get a hold of my things but know when u do ill roar and its going to be fierce. Devin from deleware your bank you work for and who ever just violated the human rights i did not authorize you to touch my account or to do the things you try on it. I have told you multiple time outloud over the pgone when u were acting all crazy about clising my account as those 3 morons tellers said you guys will do not to.

I've had my car paid off since the beginning of June, have called there 9 times as of today, sitting on hold for at least 20 minutes each time only to be transferred to someone else and sitting on hold another 20 minutes - I am waiting for my title to be released and in the process of buying a new car.

Called Kevin back today-holding for another 20 minutes only to find out he was not in the office yet. Called him back this afternoon and held for another 20 minutes for him to get back to his desk. He was surprised to hear he had told me the title would be at the DMV on the 16th-he said the very earliest it would be there would be the 20th since it takes 7-10 business days. I reminded him that I said I was going to call him on the 16th before we hung up on the 11th. He didn't know why I would think it was the 16th. I said I wanted to speak with his supervisor and he said he would need to put in a request for that and they would call me back.

How insulting and demeaning , after spending hours on the phone, being bounced around , and that was the solutionMy brand new Samsung phone is the problem!!!!The ignorance demonstrated by this incident is shameful and there were similar stupid comments on other ocassions !!!

In August of 2018, they closed the account without sending any communication informing me of such. In June 2019 I called and spoke with Janet, the assistant VP of BOA who assured me that once I paid off the $1.50 (one dollar and fifty cents) I would be issued a check for the full $300 which would be mailed to my home address. After making sure she had the full address she assured me that within 7-21 business days I would have my money. Today is September 14th and I spoke with a representative on the phone because I STILL DO NOT HAVE MY $300. After about 30 minutes she informed me that she could do NOTHING about this and I would have to CALL BACK AGAIN ON MONDAY. So the VP of BOA didn't do her job and I have to waste more time to repeat myself to another customer rep. This is unacceptable. After this, I will NEVER do any business with BOA ever again and will make sure I let anyone I know how terrible my experience has been.","1812":"Warning...Bank of America Oakton VA branch going downhill. Branch manager very rude. I wrote a review and received a bland generic response. Wrote again and received a call from someone in customer service that never took the time to investigate my complaint. Ended up writing the President and received a return call from a very rude person who tried to convince me my complaint was not valid. Have since written several very negative but accurate reviews and will continue to write reviews till my laptop dies...then will mail more letters.Again, the Oakton VA branch of Bank of America is terrible. They generally have five or six people in the branch but only one teller. Often waits are 15 minutes. And don't try to get a document notarized. Only one person is a notary who is generally tied up. I waited 30 minutes and gave up. I went next door to Capital One which was more than happy to assist me....no charge. I sought $2 bills. Forget it. Not in stock. Was told they were not a high demand note. But was told I could order then but they didn't know when they would come in. I went next door to Capital One and received 50 crisp new $2 bills.I shared my complaint with Capital One. They shared that other BoA customers had changed to their bank. Don't surprise me none.BoA...I'm going to continue sharing my story...till my laptop dies and beyond.","1813":"My husband and I are both consumers with excellent credit scores.

In the end we incurred $150 in \"foreign exchange fees\". When we called to notify Bank of America and explain our position as new card users we were informed by the CSR that our situation was unfortunate and that they were unable to waive the fees as courtesy to the consumer and that they \"must set the precedence\" by holding firm to associated fees.

This should make me the ideal, responsible, trustworthy client. On August 23, 2019 I deposited a $20,000 check from ***** bank into my business account. I had been transferring money into that same ***** account for months for business, however that was the first check I had received from the same account. I asked when the funds would be available and after checking with the manager, the teller told me the funds would be available the next day. They were not. When I called to question when the funds would be available I was told it was being held by \"Risk Management.\" They said none of the funds would be available until September 4rd, a full seven business days after the deposit. They said they believed the check would be returned and a letter had been sent to me stating that fact. The check cleared the payor's account and was deducted on August 26th. I waited until August 28th to call the bank again about my funds. I told them the funds from the check in question were removed from the ***** account on August 26th and I would like the hold removed and the funds put into my account. Customer service said no, they didn't have the funds yet and Risk Management would not budge, \"and by law, we can hold funds for as long as 7 to 10 days.\" I asked to speak to risk management and was refused, they do not speak to customers!?! You may only communicate through customer service! Yesterday, I finally received the letter from Bank of America and it did in fact say \"A hold was placed on your check because check specific information indicates item may be returned.\" I called B of A yet again and told them the check had been paid and asked why I couldn't have my money. They said that just because the money had been deducted from the ***** account didn't mean that B of A had the actual funds from the check yet and no I couldn't have the money until September 3rd, again repeating the mantra \"and by law, we can hold funds for as long as 7 to 10 days.\" Frustrated, I called my daughter-in-law, a manager for ***** for over 15 years and explained what was going on. She said \"B of A is just jerking you around, of course they have the money.\" She suggested I take a copy of the front and back of the check that had cleared along with a screen shot of the account showing the deduction of the check and physically go to the bank, speak with a manager, show them the proof and have them handle it. I went to B of A with proof in hand. They insisted that B of A did not have the funds and went so far as to say that I had no idea how banking works. \"The check clearing and money has to go through the Federal Reserve and they put money in a truck and drive it to the bank.\" Really?? In this digital age?? I insisted (as I was told by my daughter-in-law) that when the money is deducted from one bank it goes onto the books of the other bank. They said no, ***** still has the funds and repeated the mantra \"and by law, we can hold funds for as long as 7 to 10 days.\" So I went home and called ***** and relayed what B of A said about ***** deducting the funds from their clients account and still holding the money. She said that was untrue, when a check is paid the money is gone from ****** So I called Bank of America again and I was told all of the same nonsense, \"B of A does not have the funds and by law, we can hold funds for as long as 7 to 10 days.\" I told her that \"the funds are not magically floating in the air, they are on SOMEONE'S books. I can't use them, the writer of the check can't use them - the money is on B of A's books and I want them in my account.\" She insisted they were not on B of A's books so I asked her to send me that in writing. She said no, they had sent me a letter and that was all I would receive. I said, the letter was referencing August 23rd when they in fact didn't have the funds, it's August 29th now and everyone keeps saying that B of A doesn't have the funds and I want that in writing. Again, she refused and told me my funds would be available September 4rd no matter what. Unfortunately, while the law says the banks can hold your funds for 7 to 10 days, doesn't mean they should if their \"worries\" are proved to be unwarranted and the check is shown to be paid.","3076":"I have been a BOA customer for over 15 years with a number of checking accounts as well as money marker and savings accounts. About a month ago they began harassing me about a personal checking account I set up for taking people to Israel. BOA personnel set the account up for me about two years ago. I made it as clear as I possible could that this was not a business. I wanted an account separate from my primary checking because of the amount of money people were paying me for the Airlines and Tour company. This year was the first year I actively used the account. About a month after I got back from Israel I begin to get harassing phone calls from BOA in regard to the account. After it was investigated it was learned BOA set the account profile up wrong. A week after getting this worked out I located an email in my junk email notifying me that I had less than 25 dollars in another checking account I had set up for my daughter when she went to college. Without notifying me BOA closed this account without notifying me in advance took control of the funds in the account. After finally getting someone on the phone they stated they could not up date my daughters profile since she was also on the account. Stated they would mail me a check for the monies in the account. \n\nBank of America never bother to notify me of the closing of the account and dealing with their customer service is a hit or miss event. Beware of Bank of America. They will close your account without notification and temporarily seize your funds. They have closed a large percentage of their branches and make it very hard to do business with them.","3077":"\"WANRNING BANK OF AMERICA CUSTOMERS\"\n\nSome of you may love Bank of America, for you I am happy.\n\nI on the other hand think they are completely and utterly worthless.\n\nAfter depositing my check this last Friday Saturday I wake up to see if it's cleared, it had.\n\nThis morning I wake up to find out they've pulled it back out of my account putting me in the hole quite a bit! So I call to find out what happened as I know on our companies end it's already been removed from the account.\nThey processed to tell me that because they've never seen me deposit a check from Wells Fargo they decided to protect themselves and put a hold on my check until September 4th which is nearly two weeks from the time I deposited it.\nSo needless to say the very minute I can close my account and move on to another banking facility that actually knows how to do Banking and treat people right I will do so.\n\nSo if you have a Bank of America account be forewarned that when you deposit your check days later they can remove it even after you pay bills and have automatic withdrawals coming out, sure they will refund the $35 transaction fee per bounce but that doesn't change the fact that bills will be late and fees will be assessed by those companies not too sure if they're going to be refunding ** those amounts as well.\n\nShare if you think Bank of America is worthless.","2814":"I'm a customer of Bank of America for 20 years.

Diana","1815":"Overall I recommend it, but let me tell you my specific circumstance. I got the BOA secured card in late 2017 with the $300 deposit. I had really poor credit (low 500s) and had decided that I really needed to change my habits and start rebuilding. The way I looked at this card was a chance to rebuild NOT as a card with any perks. I hadn\u2019t earned that right. I knew I didn\u2019t want one of those \u201cbad credit\u201d cards where they approve you for $300, but your initial available credit was like $175!!After a year of responsible use and on time payments, I called customer service to ask about limit increases. Here is what I was told, and this seems to be different than what I\u2019m reading from others. I should note that I\u2019m also a BOA banking customer, I\u2019m not sure if criteria differs based on that fact. Anyway, I was told I can make deposits (in $100 increments) and that was the only way to increase my limit on a secured card. Also that I couldn\u2019t request graduation to an unsecured card but that it would be periodically evaluated. I will say they were very unclear when these evaluations take place.Earlier this year I decided to start making deposits to increase my available credit, while also keeping my usage low. I increased the limit to $700.Within 6months of making those deposits, they were returned (all $700) to my checking acct and my limit was increased to $1700. I had finally been graduated to an unsecured card after almost 2 years (yes, I called them to confirm this). This has been a slow process but that was a rewarding moment. I\u2019m going to wait a little longer and then apply for a card for above average creditMy only question is, if I had started making those additional deposits a long time ago would my card have been graduated sooner? Could just be coincidence though. My FICO score was 662 when the graduation took place, and I have had ZERO late payments on anything in the last 2 years, since they look at all of your credit report when making this decision NOT just your Americard usage.","2816":"Bank of America is lacking in customer service and technology. I have always lodged checks to my account. I always thought that once you lodge a check, it is automatic that you will receive $200.00 the next business day.

Which caused my checking account overdraft. I spent an hour-and-a-half on the phone trying to get this resolved. Then they told me I had to call back the next day because the charges were pending and they had to wait for them to clear. I just spent 50 minutes on the phone now that they're cleared. Now, they tell me that I have to wait three days since they were pulled from a different bank and they have to wait for them to clear with that bank. In the meantime, I'm overdrawn $4,000. And... Once they do process it three days from now, it takes another two days for the money to get back into my account. I got switched around to seven different departments. Their customer service absolutely sucks and none of them have any idea what they're doing. I have a $20,000 line of credit and I'm in the process of canceling this credit card.","3078":"I started with BoA when it was LaSalle Bank...... never had an issue until recently when I attempted to pay my credit balance, and the app was not working properly.

Refused to wave a late fee (never been late before), and insinuated that I was being dishonest about attempting to log into my mobile account.  Sorry BoA, my integrity is worth far more than $25.  Unbelievable.  That's the last of my hard earned money that they will ever get! Never experienced anything like this before.....

We were charged 2 - $35 overdraft fees by BOA and called to speak with BOA and they were very unwilling to help and would not consider refunding the $70 of fees back to my account.  Customer Service rep was very unhelpful and condescending. These fees are ABSURD!  and the fact that we have been customers for so long and they would not help us is even more ABSURD.  Extremely dissatisfied customer here.  We work very hard and have children to care for and we do not feel comfortable with BOA anymore and their fees for profit.

To just give them the money for my card I definitely did not have on record with them someone in in the corporate office of Bank of America which I was refused the right to speak to the company that I sign a contract with to open up the account with this is bad business and I did not give anyone at Bank of America nor Google the permission to take any money nor debit any money for my account lately people have been hacking into people information and even mind and making debit transaction without my consent and this is what my business account this is well they normally would stop $10 transaction but they will not stop a transaction that comes from a big corporation that allows people to just go into your account and can't get it out my grievance is with Bank of America for hiring customer service reps to tell people that they're being rude because they're upset because they have allowed someone to into their account and take that money I don't think that's appropriate for any person is getting paid per hour to speak to anyone in that manner rather their speaking loudly or not I did not curse them I did not call them out their name so I don't understand why I was spoken to in that manner they were very disrespectful they talked over me the whole time they were upset because I was not agreeing on what they were saying I hope this message get to someone in carpet I hope that we can resolve this situation as quickly as possible","2818":"Mortgage and securities fraud, Note forgery, robo-signing, identity thefts, unlawful collection, unjust enrichment - all business as usual.I am a victim of a RICO enterprise operated by Bank of America though its sham conduits like Caliber Home Loans, Inc., PennyMac Loan Services (fka Countrywide Financial) - with full support from Black Knight, Inc (owned by Fidelity National Finances)BOA uses third parties like Caliber and PennyMac  to defraud borrowers like myself, internally defaulted my loan, stole my identity, forged my Note, unjustly enriched themselves and now threaten me with foreclosure while my loan is not in default (although BOA defaulted it in its bookkeeping records to fraudulently remove from Ginnie Mae pool. BAO makes huge profits, about $20 per $1, even before you start to amortize your loan, by secretly trading on borrowers names, signatures and reputation on the open market without my knowledge and consent. All my payments do not benefit investors but solely create a handsome income for BOA. BOA also uses services from a well-known document foregery facility Black Knight  who helps BOA to defraud borrowers. In my situation Black Knight ordered a Map from FEMA to place bogus flood insurance on my property which not in the Flood zone (I suspect this insurance was result of kickbacks)Later Black Knight sent to fake \"Servicer\" PennyMac a pile of my closing documents with a copy of my Promissory Note and a poorly forged Allonge signed by some Collateral Shipper Jordan Lune who assigned my loan to Caliber on the same closing day; and whose electronic signature is a text-book evidence of modern robo-signing and forgery.Neither Caliber or PennyMac never had any of my loan documents and never processed any payments. They merely got a password to Black Knight database (known as \"boarding\") and posed as \"Servicers\" to defraud borrowers about who is a real party who collects payments - BOA.Anyone who knows about foreclosure litigation and securitization of residential debt knows that the only way the banks could succeed is if they had a central repository and central command center from which all documents were fabricated and all instructions were issued.For nearly all loans the central command was Lender Processing Systems, aided by DOCX. While DOCX is technically defunct and Loraine Brown went to jail taking one for the team, the functions of LPS remained the same.LPS changed its name to Black Knight and in a PR coup transformed itself into the publisher of what is largely viewed as comprehensive data on mortgage lending and foreclosures.Hence it went from the purveyor of false, fraudulent, forged documentation to the purveyor of data perceived as reliable and thence became a trusted source whose data is considered worthy of legal presumptions.Systems at LPS\/Black Knight include data processing on virtually all residential loans subject to claims of securitization many of which are represented by data on the MERS Platform which is a workaround to hide separate split transfers of the debt, the note and the mortgage or deed of trust.The systems on LPS\/Black Knight are designed for the the express purpose of presenting consistent data in foreclosure claims. As such it also enables the rotation of apparent servicers, none of whom perform bookkeeping functions even if some of them interact with borrowers as if they were actually the servicers.The rotation of servicers comes with the false representation and illusion of boarding in which the process is falsely represented as meaning that the new servicer inspected, audited, reviewed and input the data into their own system. None of that occurred. Instead the new servicer merely gained access to the same LPS system as the last servicer with a new login and password.All evidence shows that the functions for fabricated, forging and robosigning documents continue to be performed under the direction of LPS\/Black Knight which receives all instructions from various investment banks who have each started their own securitization scheme masking apparent trades in the secondary market for loans and trades in the shadow banking market where \u201cprivate contracts\u201d are regularly traded without any securities regulation.Far from dropping their connection with LPS\/DOCX the major banks have completely embraced this central repository of all loan data, all of which is subject to manual and algorithmic manipulation to suit the needs of the banks; thus they produce a report that creates the illusion of credibility, reliability and even independence even though none of those things are true.So now U.S. Bank is further embracing LPS\/Black Knight technology in the form of \u201cEmpower\u201d for loan originations. U.S. bank is of course the major player whose name is used in foreclosures despite the fact that it has no interest in the loans and does not receive one cent from foreclosure sales of property. It merely receives a royalty for the use of its name as part of a fictitious name of a nonexistent trust which is falsely represented to have engaged in a transaction in which the trust acquired the debt, note and mortgage on multiple loans.This deal furthers the PR myth. It strengthens Black Knight as having the attributes of a legitimate player when in fact it is a central figure in the greatest economic crime in human history.Research made by lawyer Neil Garfield whose blog is Living Lies","2819":"I feel safe and it\u2019s like that all of my money are being used wisely and no waste at all","1817":"There is no benefit to having an account (multiple) here. Find a better bank. High rates for borrowing, low rates for saving, won't even let me deposit change from my son's piggy bank. Customer service is practically non existent.","3082":"Bank of America has been the worst bank I have even encountered. They pre-approved a client of mines for an amount she didn't qualify for, setting up the client for failure, and loosing her deposit. The loan officer who was handling the file pre approved my client for an amount based on her tax returns and pay statements. She put in an offer, got her offer accepted and went through all the process. Paid for a home inspection, they made her order an appraisal and also made her get an insurance binder for the property. Everything was going smooth until it was a couple of weeks before closing. Then the nightmare and games started. They kept delaying everything, my client and my self was trying to call and email the loan officer daily. He started ignoring everyone and would not provide a concrete answer. My client then reached out to the loan processor who kept giving my client a bunch of excuses. She even said once that the underwriter called out sick and that they won't be able to give my client an answer for a few more days. It's ludicrous that a big bank like BofA has only one underwriter handling all the files. They made my client run around getting paper work that the loan officer never sent to the loan processor. When she sent in the paper work then underwriters would say they can't accept it. My client is an independent contractor and has no employer who could verify her employment and income. I would imagine that a bank would use common sense and look at the tax returns, pay statements to verify a customers employment. It got to the point that the seller of the house refused to sign any extensions because BofA was always taking forever to reply back and give us a concrete answer. We informed them that the house went back on the market and that we were way behind on the deadlines. They didn't care at all, instead of expediting the file they just kept on adding days, weeks of delays. My client sent them a letter they requested and the loan officer told my client it would take up to 5 days to review the letter. Absolutely ridiculous, why would it take 5 days to review a letter? Knowing that the file was way behind. It got to the point that my client started requesting something, either a commitment letter of a letter of denial. The loan processor kept ignoring her request and kept on asking for more paperwork which my client had already sent to them. It's almost like they figured they made a mistake and they were trying to stall things and find a way to deny the loan. After almost 3 weeks they finally decided to deny the loan saying that my client had too much debt which she does not and that they could not verify her income, which was all on paper on her tax returns. My client is so stressed out from this ordeal that she has given up the idea of buying a home and also faces loosing her deposit due to BofA's mistake. I would not wish this type of thing to happen to anyone, thus I would suggest anyone who's thinking about buying a home to stay away from BofA. They will make your life a misery. They are a big corporation which does not care if you end up getting screwed at the end. Try to get pre-approved from lenders which deals with mortgages only, stay away from BofA. They are the worst.","3084":"I have been with BOA (Bank of America) for 10 years. I can honestly say that for the most part they were good to me being that I was 16 or 17 when I opened the account.

They don't have humans attempt to notify customers before they drop a bomb on their credit score!  They further justified their actions by siting a regulation that requires them to treat all customers in the same (poor) fashion, so if they called me, they would have to call all their customers before they damaged their credit.

Well under the old account I had opened a savings account in which they drafted $25\/month from my checking and put it into my savings and this was done do avoid monthly service fees.\n\n\nWe had to go into a branch where we live to get the new account opened which was not a problem.  We asked them at the branch if this would cause any problems with our savings account a the way it was setup to avoid monthly fees and we were assured it would all be moved to the new account and all would function the same.  Come April I check the savings account and see that we are being charged fees and nothing is being drafted.  I call and speak to a representative who advises that she would talk to a supervisor to see what they can do.  After a wait she gets back on and advises that we were grandfathered into the $25\/month draft to prevent service fees and that they would fix it and refund the fees.\n\nNow its June, we are still being charged monthly service fees and are now told we must comply with the new rules for the savings account.\n\nMind you it was never an issue until our checking account got compromised and we had to open a new one.  At this point I have closed the savings account and unless Bank of America contacts me and fixes this putting it back to how it was I will be leaving to another bank where I don't have to worry about the lies.\n","3114":"Bank of America is horrible .

I printed out the \"temporary\" card information and began using it while waiting for my physical card. It took 4 hours to find a vacant motel room during the Senior Olympics and I used the credit card. I called after making my reservations to make sure they were good...no problem. My room was being held. My flight was delayed and I called again to let them know I was running late for checking in...only to be told I was cancelled because my credit card didn't go through! I had already placed $1300+\/- on it and had a $5000 limit. Called the contact number which I obtained from the Alaska Airline Customer Service at SeaTac. Got tons of excuses. BofA wanted to confirm the transaction. Temp info is \"not valid\". The temp info was provided by Alaska Airlines and not BofA. You have the wrong expiration date. I was told the physical card takes 4-6 days. Yet the paperwork says 7-10 BUSINESS days. Nothing states how long the temp card is good for while waiting for the physical card. So, here I am, now with no housing in a sold location due to Olympics. They tell me they can \"expediate\" a card to me....but I have no where to expediate it to since I no longer have housing. I spent the next 6 hours trying to find some plus had to travel an extra 15 miles and much more to stay with a kind lady....arriving at 6am...just a few hours before we needed to meet the children we are adopting. Needless to say, we were exhausted. While looking for housing, other customers were more helpful... getting online to help me. The last thing three kids were are trying to adopt needed was another disappointment in their lives. Thanks to the kind lady that provided housing, we didn't have to disappoint them. But, Alaska Airlines or BofA, there is NO excuse for this. I'm not sure whose fault it is. BofA is blaming Alaska. Never once did I get a text, an email, or any other warning or notice that the card was, in effect, canceled. I asked that they pay the difference between motel costs....the next cheapest was over $180\/nite. They refused, stating they don't do any compensation. This was the icing on the cake...after sitting for two hours in a hot plane on a delayed flight due to \"lost paperwork\". BEWARE. I canceled the card that night. The physical card has now arrived and is being destroyed.","3115":"While the customer service representatives were very nice, I'm absolutely blown away by the decision to not retract a \"late payment\". Apparently, even though you're given the option to credit points toward the balance of your credit card, it doesn't count as an actual payment. The representative says there's a window that pops up stating this...I missed it, so likely, this is one of those super small side notes no one pays attention to. If I had added another step for myself by depositing the money to my bank account first, they say that would have counted...really??? It's the SAME thing. So, over a \"late\" balance of $44 that was actually paid on time through credits that were mine to use, there was an unwillingness to rectify the situation. I have been with BoA for over a decade and brought quite a bit of money to them with high credit card balances in between buying and selling homes multiple times (we flip properties). We have our mortgages with *********** and I will absolutely be switching to them for credit card service, as well, now. Terrible decision making on BoA's part in my opinion...of course, I'm just one lowly person. \u00f0???","3116":"This is a minus 1 million for me and here is why...\nSome words of warning on mobile banking (please read)... On 9\/11\/18 I deposited a check given to me by my old tenant from his ********** account. In May 2019 I received a text from my tenant indicating that the check was redeposited. I checked in my account in Bank of America and with my bookkeeper and the check was not deposited into any of my accounts. It was no where but there was a deduction in my account in the amount of $2000. Bank of America had taken the money out of my account and returned it to my old tenant. I called them and they said ***** told them to and since the check was deposited twice they had to take it. Of course I argued and tried to find out who deposited it. They said the only person who could trace the check was the old tenant. I went to ***** who told me the same thing. I called my old tenant who luckily is a nice guy. He called his bank and they told him they didn't know and he got his money back and that was that. I called the Milford Police Department and kudos to them the officer that came to my office (******) took the information and went to BOA who said they couldn't help and then to *****. ***** said the money was deposited at 2:29 am on 5\/7 into a bank account that wasn't mine. The check was made out to me and said \"FOR DEPOSIT ONLY\" on the back. ***** said the hard check took precedence over the mobile always even though it was EXPIRED and not deposited by me or into my account. The only person who could do anything about this was my old tenant who needed to file a fraud investigation that then needed to be investigated and the two of us would sign affidavits. At this date, 6\/17 I am still out of $2000. My old tenant awaits paperwork from ***** that was sent in the MAIL. The check I now assume was taken out of my car where I was parked in a NYC parking lot. I usually keep all my checks at the office but this one I opened while travelling last year and it happened to remain in my briefcase.\n\nThe reason I am writing this email is that you either don't use mobile banking or write DEPOSITED all over your mobile banking checks after you put them into your account. If this situation happened to someone who was living paycheck to paycheck or did not have any backup they would be in a dire situation. Please SHARE this with everyone you know as I am sure some of them do not shred nor write deposit on their checks. This is not my last post about this because I am going to file a civil action so that it gets some press and so that it doesn't happen to anyone else. SHAME on BOA, ***** and ********* If you know of anyone who had this happen to them please let me know.","3117":"I've been a customer for 20 plus years, and really not sure why. I was charged $280 in overdraft fees from a \"pending authorization\" that never cleared. Customer service was not very empathetic.

For a bank that was previously sued for predatory charges they sure have not seemed to change their tune.","3118":"I had to file bankruptcy twice because the bank of America refuses to credit my account for the payments I have made. I filed bankrupty on 06\/2017. And the bank of America has always harassed me by objecting to what I reported how many payments were past due, which they had reported on the monthly mortgage statement they would send me. They have requested the court to raise my payment several times. And now Carrington has bought my loan but Bank Of America is asking the court permission to foreclose on my home.  Carrington is also playing the same games like a bank of America not giving me credit for the payments I have made and lying to the bankruptcy court that I am 5 months behind from 10\/01\/2018-05\/01\/2019 and they have on their statement that all the payments I have made. It really makes me angry how Bank of America is asking the bankruptcy court permission to foreclose on my home! They took $21,000 from me in 2013 when I did a home loan modification and they have lied to my bankruptcy attorney about it making her think I'm lying to try and make her drop my bankruptcy case so they can steal my home from me even though I am making my payments and have on time since 07\/01.\/2017.  They should be punished for asking permission from the bankruptcy court to foreclose on my home, even though I have been making my payments! They don't like that they are getting very little payment from the past due amount! Home ownership is dead in America. Because all mortgage companies want to do is steal your payments you have made and then foreclose on your home. It's like legalizing stealing! And how BOA doesn't apply your payments to your mortgage balance is stealing your money too! There is no true justice for this crime these mortgage companies are doing to home owners! Bank Of America is very greedy and self-centered people! Well, I'm fighting them by sending proof of the payments I have made to them from the very beginning!  Bank of America hates it to the core that I'm fighting! I'm protected under bankruptcy from them foreclosing but them asking the bankruptcy court permission to foreclose on my home, is them not accepting that I am protected to prevent them from wrongful forecloser on my home. It's just another form of harassment from Bank Of America trying to get their way! I'll be asking my lawyer for her to request the judge punish bank of America for lying to the bankruptcy court! I seem to never catch a break because I am a single female parent and Bank Of America is purposely making things hard on me!","3120":"Bank of America is ****.

She demands your credit card information (full 16 digits, expiration date and security code) sent over text or email before anything else (vs other lenders would send you a link to security pay for appraisal online). She texted \"so I can use it to shop online\". Even if she intended to joke, this is not funny.And, you are absolutely not allowed to shop around or compare rates if you want to work with her. In her own words, \"If you pick Bank of America, then it has to be exclusive. If you don\u2019t have faith in us, then I still cannot proceed.\" - THIS IS AFTER ME AND MY REALTOR SPENT ALL DAY GETTING HER ALL THE DOCUMENTS SHE REQUESTED INCLUDING MY CREDIT CARD INFORMATION.

If you're concerned I'm feeling even more uncomfortable...Agent: Me neitherMe: Sorry?Agent: You really want me to say it? Me: I want to understand what you're concerned about as long as that's professional and reasonable.

Then the customer service agent tries to trick you up by saying oh you re wives an alert and also encourages you to call the company and reverse the charges which is a negative practice. If the money isn't in the account just don't pay it send it back simple as that \n. Bad banking process. Thumbs down 10 yrs and they have no loyalty.","1904":"Worst bank I ever seen.Poor customer service they will never go out from thier policy's for a customer.I came from Chase, I am going to switch back.I would say Chase is the King.

Very poor service, if you care for your business stay away from Bank of America.","1906":"Ive had bofa credit card for almost a year now.. i love it!

S. I. Came. Bank of America stated that they mailed it on may 5,2019 he still hasn't received it. They sent it to the wrong address and they had the right address. Banks of America also stated that if they stop payment on it it will be 91days before he will receive the new print out check.

I will close my business account with BOA.","1907":"Port Orange, Florida, Taylor Road Branch is the worst B of A branch I have run across. Nice people that are over worked and misdirected by management, in my opinion. When the automated phone says they will return a call within 24 hours is not my idea of a community\/local bank. I see loads of people waiting in the reception area to open accounts but frequently only one teller to handle existing customers waiting in line or in the drive up window. I called last week and a recording said my contact at the branch was out until Monday, May 20th. No return call. I have tried to call three times today, Wednesday and get the same 24 hour automated routine. Totally unacceptable. When my checks run out I will move the account to a bank that just answers the phone! 5th3rd is the most likely candidate.","1908":"Closing this account next week. Not a good card. Go with capital one or another bank. 13 months never missed a payment, never paid the minimum, paid the day the account closes for the month.Since getting this I've gotten two capitol one cards, unsecured bot have had at least 1 limit increase. A target credit card, limit increased, I've refinanced a $17,000 car loan.This card, they will not increase the limit or turn it to an unsecured card. Don't waste your time go somewhere else.","1909":"A mistake happened at my regular bank, causing them to freeze my account. My BoA credit card payment didn't go through as a result. I called in, (worst automated teller system in the world) and finally got a hold of a customer service rep. She said that my payment went through and that there would be no fees. Today, I noticed that the payment did not go through and that there was a $25 returned check fee. I called customer service and the rep was unable to help me so she elevated to the manager. The manager said that due to the nature of the fee and my relationship with BoA, the fee is ineligible to be waived. I was planning on staying with BoA for a long time. However, due to their inability to care for customers and try to retain them, I will no longer be banking with BoA.I recommend everyone stay away from BoA and their horrible customer service.","3290":"Restricted Card, Hung Up On Hold So, my chip got damaged as it usually does. I order a new card, and while I wait I\u2019m forced to withdraw cash for things. Well, BoA thinks that\u2019s odd and puts a hold on my card. No worries, a text comes through letting me confirm I am indeed me. Only, the holds still there. So i call, and the first specialist after a fifteen minute wait can\u2019t do anything and transfers me to a department that can. Okay. After another ten minute wait, the phone just hangs up. They hung up on me, on hold, stranded, unable to pay for anything like gas, etc etc. I called back only I\u2019ve lost my spot in the queue.","2825":"B of A charges to many fee's.

I have yet to have a problem they watch out for the purchases that are made with your card, yes having it locked is annoying but in my case (yes this is true) I spend approximately $75-$100 a month in Apples App Store so I don\u2019t blame them for seeing it as strange activity. All I had to do was make a quick call say yes I did make those purchases card unlocked no big deal.

I had a recent issue with overdraft fees after making a deposit at their ATM. I called customer support and spoke with Joanna. No fault of hers, but she was unable to credit any of the overdraft fees which totaled over $200. I made deposits at the ATM to cover 2 days worth of expenses, but they did not credit the money until the following day. There was no posting on the ATM itself nor was there a notification during the transaction of a specific cut-off time for same-day posting of deposits. I also specified to her that information is not in the mobile deposit of the app either. I visit multiple BofA ATMs to make deposits and NONE of them have a specific cut-off time posted.

Had I been employed they would have been able to work out a payment plan. WHAT KIND OF BACKWARDS IDEA IS THIS!!!!\n\nI need help, they are unwilling to give me any. Account is now closed.

Once again, this didn't even raise a flag at B of A.  Unbelievable.- Call system is annoying, always trying to avoid connecting you to a representative.  Wait times are long, sometimes 45+ minutes.

I have been a customer for a decade and i'm furious with their dishonest and morally bankrupt policies. They LIE ON THEIR WEBSITE about the exchange rate they offer. So if you're traveling abroad and use their currency converter to calculate how much something will cost in dollars, its lowballed. This in ** opinion is fraud. When I called to confront them about this they said they \"round\" the rate to the nearest tenths place, what?? You're a bank, have you never heard of a penny? Also the way they \"rounded\" was legit magic math, it didn't follow the accepted mathematical standards for rounding. \nTo add insult to financial injury when I called to complain about a purchase that came out to be $40 more than their own website said it would be, they credited ** account. Amazing, right? NO because I woke up this morning to a \"Balance Adjustment\" in which they've charged ** back. That was just on one item, think about every little purchase I made thinking the exchange rate was literal not figurative.  \nIn a broad sense this is why banks need more regulation. If you are going to give people a certain  rate specific to the thousands place, then you need to charge that rate. Bank of America is actively trying to push their customers into more debt by making available false exchange rates on their website, leading customers to believe they can afford items when they possibly can't.","250":"B of A is horrible because: they charge their customers 8 dollars to cash a check on their own account.My 86 year old mother, unable to get around, can't enter the bank herself much less drive there is charged 8 dollars for me to cash her checks.

Their online banking is very straight forward and easy to use and it is so easy to find detailed info on anything you need.","3139":"What I think is out of the question. I recently applied to get a loan not a credit card. That's what mr *************** From Merrill lynch game me told me that bank of America does not give you money no more.

Also if a need to get money from the loan I have to pay. 20 dollars for every 100.i get out of the loan. That was loaned me.how that's that work for them. It reminds me of when I was 16 years old that my daddy gave me like a prepaid card to buy my stuff. That way.he would keep taps on what I bought. Is feels the same. Also I have a limit of 250..I thought it was a loan..I just think that mr *************** Racially profile me and I guess he thought that I was going to take off to Mexico. And never come back. Lol.or maybe my last name if it was to be different I would have walk out of bank of America with a cashier's check. So that I could deposit it in my bank account. On the same.

So I go get the checks back from the teller the next day and as instructed I deposited it through the ATM, next day I see the reversal on my account, I called the 800 number and customer service advised me that I needed a 3rd party agreement setup for my account and that would fix the problem.  I now have $70k+ in checks that will not post to my account and are in the mail coming back to me.  I walked into the branch and ask for the branch manager, of course he is at lunch and the assistant comes to help, I explained the situation and he made it look like it was my fault!!!

Although, my account is in great standing and I have really good credit, I\u2019ve never been able to get them to raise my credit limit. Even $500 is completely out of the question. At the same time, however, they\u2019ve bombarded me with pre-approved offers for both their Cash Rewards and Travel Rewards cards. Because every one showed a solid APR rather than a range, I figured I had a good chance for approval, so I finally accepted the offer for the Cash Rewards World Mastercard, and they approved me with a $12,500 starting limit. It\u2019s just bizarre that they couldn\u2019t trust me with an extra $500 on my BankAmericard, but they\u2019re perfectly fine with my having an extra $12,500 at my disposal. Other than just sheer weirdness on their part, I\u2019ve never encountered any problems with Bank of America, it\u2019s website, or its app. Every time I\u2019ve had to call customer service, it was always helpful and friendly.","3141":"Bank of America is a perfect example of corporate greed. Customer Service is in line with policy and they don't take the client's issues in consideration.

When I reached to their customer service, they were no help and claimed that the company should take care of it not them. Even when I explained that the company did not answer my email nor my calls, they kept repeating the same things over and over. When I finally asked to speak to the manager, she was no help either.

So are customers expected to not travel? I made an appeal and provided police reports and all other necessary documentation. It has almost been a year later and I have YET to have this issue resolved. I keep getting the run around and being lied to stating that my case has been made a orioroty but somehow I haven't heard from anyone. I have been a loyal customer since 2011 but I don't feel that BOA values their customers. I have never been treated this way or had to beg for MY MONEY! This bank does not deserve a single star from me. They don't have good customer care and I am at the point of banking elsewhere.","3292":"Awful Check Deposit Policy And Customer Service Bank of America is the worst bank I have ever banked with. Their policy on check Cashing is awful. Every time I have deposited a check it is put on hold for 3+ days. Even if it is from a company that uses Bank of America. You can call them multiple times and they still won\u2019t release the hold saying it\u2019s a system process they can\u2019t do anything about. Then if in those three days a charge comes through they charge you a NSF charge even though they are holding a $3,000+ check. Awful awful awful customer service. And god forbid you use their app to deposit it. They don\u2019t even give you $200 available that they would give you if you go in to the store. When I called they said they can\u2019t trust the account the check was written from has funds... the account is from a corporation that uses their bank and is a million dollar corporation.....

We were purchasing hay for our horses which in our state there is no sales tax. This ripoff business insists on charging sales tax. When they would not refund the tax we told them to cancel the order while we were still there at the counter. They refused to do either stating there are no refunds on feed....which is not posted anywhere on the premises.1)  We had a choice of taking the hay and accept being defrauded....not an option.2) We could have refused to leave without a refund and possibly be arrested.....not an option.3) We could refuse to take possession of the hay and dispute the charges on our card.We did #3. BOA did not even give our dispute credence because they said we 'abandoned' the merchandise and it was a legitimate charge we authorized. Of course we authorized it until they put illegal sales tax on the purchase.BOA caused us to be victimized twice. We have exemplary credit and put every single thing we buy on a card every month and pay off the balance at the end of each month.

I then googled ePay and Sinemia and found out what they were. I thought the payment hadn't gone through as I got no confirmation notice right away. A few days later Sinemia let me know they had my payment and to sign up with their app. I checked BOA online and found I had been charged the annual fee. I disputed that with BOA and initially they credited the fee back. About a month later I got a letter in the mail that they had received information from Sinemia about the transaction and they felt it was a legitimate charge and put it back on my account. They never told me what info they based their decision on and didn't even give me time to reply which could only be by letter. The kicker was that the day I got the letter was the last day to reply. BOA even closed my account (after 13 years) and lied that I asked to have it closed in a complaint to the feds! Don't cross the CS or dispute dept or they will eat your children.","3149":"I called in because I am worried about my ability to pay my bills\nI have a BOA credit card and asked them if there was any options \nTheir hardship program isn't worth taking as it would only drop my rate about 4% and make my monthly payments about $40 cheaper\n","3148":"Terrible bank to deal with on a personal and business level.

Bank of America - it's just the most terrible and disgusting bank in the US, which I only know !!!I have been a customer of this bank for almost two years. I had a business account and a personal account (there was a debit and credit card).After my closing, I was told at the bank that I should not owe anything to the bank, that is, even the bank would owe me some cents. An employee on the phone told me then that these cents would be mailed to me in the form of a paper check.Further, I just forgot about it and knew that I should receive a check on my mail.Then after a while I saw a letter on my e-mail stating that I have outstanding debts. I did not respond to this letter, because I decided that it was some kind of mistake.After several months, I looked into my folder again - spam in my email inbox (and after closing my account in the bank, I unsubscribed from mailings that came to my postal address from the Bank of America).And I saw that the amount of my debt increased from about $ 1.50 to $ 6, and then $ 8.I went and closed the amount of my debt.Then a few months later, I again had the amount of debt, and as a result, it grew to $ 11 .. I also did not immediately respond to this ..And in the end I went to the Bank of America itself to figure out and find out why this is happening!I was at the Bank of America near Sheepshead Bay Road. There, I explained everything and explained in detail what happened after my credit card (personal account) was closed.In the Bank of America, an employee is a woman, she made a phone call and immediately spoke a little herself, and then sat me at a separate table with a phone and I started talking to the bank employees on the phone.As a result, after talking with the employee on the phone for a long time, I explained everything to him (it was a man), to which he replied to me that they say, close this amount last time, and he told me the amount a little more than I had on my email..The amount was $ 12.02 - this is the amount he assured me and began to convince the latter with all the hidden interest (commissions). In a word, everything, there will be no more charges in my address !!!Well, I agreed and asked 10 times this employee that this is 100% my last payment, I even asked his name and wrote it down to myself.After that, I went to another Bank of America, which is located on Kings Highway and made the final payment at the checkout there, so I paid the amount of: $ 12.02. I was accordingly given a bank receipt of payment for this amount.I sighed everything and thought that I had already closed this question completely and now I should forget about it.March 14, 2019, about a month after I repaid the debt, I decided to go to the spam folder in my email and what I saw there ..The Bank of America sent me a letter again in the mail saying that I owed the bank an amount of $ 1.42 cents (arrears on my credit card).And it was absolutely not funny for me !!! I immediately called by phone that I had at the Bank of America on the hotline phone number (800) 421-2110. I was connected with a man. I told him everything abbreviated, that I closed my account (closed my credit card) - October 9, 2018 and so on ...Then he answered me that he already knew that I was calling him on this issue. He told me that he would cancel this amount and I would not owe anything.I asked this employee to send me a written confirmation that I do not have any debts to the Bank of America at my home address.I called him in the evening, somewhere around 10:30 pm. He told me that he would send a letter to my home address and asked for my home address.A terrible and completely dishonest bank, which simply brazenly deceives people who were in the past clients of this bank!!!","256":"This is the worse bank and worse customer service.BUT they are number one at ripping you off.Back in March 2018, they start charging my daughters with monthly fees, even though they told us that it was free for students. I spent 2 hours on the phone trying to fix it. We got disconnected and they didn't have the decency to call me back to finish updating my daughters profile to be able to have students status ( Students status that they had for the past 5 years). They said they wanted to update their date of birth, like it's something that changes. It is a shame.

Today I have contacted the Department of Banking of NJ and also the Better Business Bureau to see if they can help. I have closed my checking and savings account with them and am lonely waiting for this to resolve to close my credit card.  I forgot to mention that the last 4 digits of the account they are using in the letters as a matter of fact I never had the account number they refer to.

No, they will not.  Unless I am will to have it show as settled which could impede my ability to open any new checking or savings accounts, so what choice do I have but to pay the fees! The kicker in all of this is they state they could not send statements as the account was closed.  HOW is it then BofA can allow a charge to go through on a closed account and charge fees, yet you cannot send a statement - I was told it was allowed as a courtesy to me!!!

They followed up with a phone call, which yielded no results at all. Although polite, they basically told me there was nothing they can do.

My home loan was modified through ***********************, who serviced for about a year and a half with no issues.  Then it was sold back to B of A and since then it has been nothing but a frustrating nightmare for 5-6 months.  The Readers Digest version is that neither company determined a cushion to apply to my escrow account, so after 2 months with B of A, I got a letter stating my payment was increasing by over $1,000 a month.  After numerous phone calls and requests for an analysis and options to pay the shortage (most of which was manufactured), I was successful at being offered a more palatable option.  Since that letter last November, B of A denies that I was offered that payment and continues to ask for the ridiculous higher amount, failing to apply my payments, sending me pre-foreclosure letters, and causing my credit score to tank.  I have gathered all my ammunition and am in the process of trying to figure out where it should go.  Who knows?  I cannot seem to find any executives heading up the Bank of America Home Loans, or at the Simi Valley Branch, where CS is headquartered.  The customer service people are clueless.  Last one I talked to offered to help get it straightened out, and the \"help\" turned out that she would refer me to \"workout\" to reduce my payments for up to 6 months IF I qualified by sending in a wheelbarrow of verification paperwork.

As a result a lien was placed on my account. This not me blaming them for that. My complaint comes from how they choose to reply in regards to the other entity. I\u2019ve been in contact with both sides and get nothing more than the run around. I expected as much from the other side of the issue but not my bank. The only thing I was looking for was a request to expedite a response so I can recover my wife\u2019s money because the issue was never with her but since the account is joint she was dragged into this. It\u2019s well within their power to provide a reply but they\u2019re content with taking the full 30 days so that they can rack up the fees that are going to take place between now and then. You\u2019d think that if they wanted to help their customer they\u2019d have something set up for this. Even if there were a small fee involved at the very least their customer could have resolution to a very difficult situation.

I suggested they delete the HSA service from their advertisements and web site. (To no avail since I note in the summary above they still reference HSA accounts.) I ended up setting her HSA up with an on line account using another bank specializing in HSA accounts. So, their advertising on HSA accounts is false. don't waste your time trying to deal with BA on HSA accounts or any banking issues that are out of the normal daily routine.

She continued to talk over me and HUNG up on me when I raised my voice to explain I knew what transaction was.

No help was offered at all . No interest deduction no payment plans etc. They said I do not qualify even with an excellent payment record.Other credit card companies have worked with me since this hardship to keep our credit good and offered a pay off Which we paid and made good .

Here's the thing, if I close account my credit percentage will decrease. I do not want another cc, it's what gets you in trouble to begin with, but you need one to have credit history.....The other thing with BOA is, I have a checking account with them as well, I pay my cc bill on Tuesday, it still is processing Wednesday, from my checking in the same bank. BUT I pay my Citi card the same Tuesday via phone and Wednesday my bill is paid.

No warning.. just an email stating my account had been canceled due to a recent credit review and that I'll be receiving a letter in the mail with more information. \n\nI called to figure out what was going on. Apparently, my card was canceled due to a late payment for my automobile payment... a totally different account and on my PERSONAL credit file! WTF! One late payment that was actually paid off in full immediately caused BoA to cancel my BUSINESS credit card???? This is totally unacceptable and I will never use Bank of America again unless this situation is rectified ASAP.\n\nClearly, Bank of America does not care about its customers.

They added $1500 a year into my motgage and increased my payments for 3 years. Even though I fought them and continued to dispute what they were doing, they stated they wanted a new more detailed survey (cost to me out of pocket in the amount of $3000). I finally had to get the new survey, which of course totally cleared my property of any flood danger. They then stopped the forced placed flood insurance, but gave me a continual run around about refunding the $4500 they unlawfully extorted from me and would not refund it. B of A also charged many unlawful \"fees\" and \"late charges\" they refused to refund. As long as the government keeps protecting these bank criminals, they will continue to defraud people!

It has bee far from pleasant experience.  \nI have had a Bank of America Auto loan Since 2015 and on 9\/13\/2018 was rear ended while sitting a light and my vehicle was totaled.  To make a long story short, I was told by Allstate on October 11th that they were paying off the vehicle and, as a result,  I did not make the October 28th payment.  \nI called Bank of America on November 11th to confirm they had received the payment and they claimed they had not however Allstate confirmed the payment was sent.  \nI received confirmation on Nov 27th that the loan was paid in full.  \nAlthough the payment has now been received by Bank of America, they have chosen to list a late payment on my credit report.  December 7th my score dropped 128 points based on my Transunion report.  I called Bank of America and Allstate on Friday the 7th in a panic as I have current plans that require my credit.   Allstate apologized and also contacted Bank of America on my behalf and via a conference call with me on the line to help explain the issue.  I attempted to explain this is based on inaccurate information and was asking for Bank of America to assist me and adjust the payment history to reflect the final payment has been received and remove the only late payment on my credit history.     I spoke with Vxxxxy ........ who was rude, condescending and had a very confrontational approach.  I was shocked at the way she chose to approach the situation.  I requested her supervisor's contact information and then contacted her supervisor Cxxxxe M. on December 10th 2018 as directed.    That was also a very unpleasant experience and I am truly disappointed.  I would have gladly paid the one (1) remaining payment to not have my credit impacted this way and to treat me the way they did was completely unacceptable.  \nI have contacted Bank of America through email via contact us on their website and was called back by Kxxxxa A.  She conducted herself more professional than the previous two (2) however could not do anything.  She made me feel as if my situation was unimportant and then pawned me off the best she could to get off the phone.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and apparently they do not have supervisors that you can speak to.  She instructed me to call back and ask for her supervisor Cxxxxxa H, or her supervisor's supervisor Cxxxxxa S.  All of which have the same title of supervisor and do not have direct lines, emails, or extensions.  I need to call the 800 number and ask for them?  Sounds like I am being put off.  \nI also contacted BOA through Facebook and was contacted via messenger by Julio.  He forwarded me to Pxxl K from the Debt collecting department.  I have left four (4) messages and have not received a response.   \n\nI still have zero progress","3181":"I wish I could leave a review of zero stars, however that is not an option.

Two days later they returned the check in error and stated that it was the wrong amount.  Really?  We sent the exact amount that Bank of America requested.  I have contacted Bank of America no less than 6 times over the course of 3 weeks and they have not returned any phone calls or messages and have yet to resolve the matter.  We paid off the loan, but for an additional $225 that they then requested because of THEIR ERROR!

Then my teenaged son was going to Columbia alone and I needed a way to transfer him money so he would to be able to get small amounts of cash out while he was there, so foolishly, we got him two accounts. We spent an hour with a lovely person at the bank, explaining the situation, showing her all our documents, my account etc. I get home to find out that I CANNOT transfer money from my account to his at all.

If B of A were a new bank, a smaller bank, etc, I wouldn't be so frustrated, but ya know, they're not new or small, they're BANK OF AMERICAThis review has to deal with their autopay\/recurring payments system...still not sure what they mean by recurring payments. Anyway,  I have a good number of credit cards with various banks, all of which I immediately put on autopay, paying the full balance every month.  Never have I had anywhere close to the level of difficulty, confusion, frustration and amount of time invested to have things run smoothly as I have had to put into my account with B of A. We setup autopay last Spring, but then we discovered payments had not been made on time and had incurred overdue fees and interest on those unpaid bills as a result.  But why weren't we monitoring more closely? We also didn't receive our paper bills like we should have and no emails were sent about overdue payments until a month later.  Life is too crazy and hectic to monitor everything all the time -- that's why we setup autopay - so we can think less about one aspect of life...ya just can't auto-feed babies or by-pass spending time with them, doing dishes, cleaning the house.Today, the agent I was transferred to for online account access issues was totally flummoxed as to how to setup autopay.  We ended up exploring together through screen share the different tabs, trying to interpret the language used and find something that gave us clarity about whether autopay was really setup.Some quotable quotes from him:\u201cThey make it nearly impossible as they always update this\u2026something I learned two weeks ago doesn\u2019t work anymore\u201d\"WHY IS THIS IMPOSSIBLE?\u201d after 25 minutes on the phone\"They could word it better to be honest\"He was doing his best - extremely kind and determined to help me resolve the issue.  But as he stated -- things get changed frequently, and it seems like those updates and the necessary training are not passed down so that agents can be helpful,  let alone customers being able to navigate things on their own. Is it any wonder customers are confused when the B of A employees don't know what's going on?  B of A may be wonderful in every other way, but I can't give them a better review with how this has all played out so far.","3197":"Horrible customer service.  I called to dispute a charge and the people who I spoke with were rude and asked for information such as full SSN, full account #, number on back of card etc....  I called the number on the bill and was directed to these people.   Horrible experience.","295":"I have had a B of A credit card for 24 years. I always pay my bills promptly. I did not see the e-mail notification of my bill of $92.00 last 2 months, if I got them at all and in consequence had a late fee of applied, which was a minor problem. As soon as I found out I missed a payment, I immediately called and explained missing their emails and informed them that my credit union would send the money immediately electronically. It would have been good customer relations to waive the fee, but they refused to do so. The main problem with BoA was after I pad and they received the money, I received a letter from BoA stating that my credit limit (built up over years) had been reduced to $500 from $57,500. If I wanted a store charge card, I would have gotten one and it would have been much more that $500. I called to ask how the decision was made, Tonya was no help and I asked for a manager. After waiting on hold for about 20 minutes, I hung up and will not ever speak to anyone there again. Absolutely the worst customer service imaginable, how anyone uses BoA is beyond me. Save some aggravation and go to other cards, Am Exp or Citi, much better customer service. So be warned: years of loyalty are worth less to B of A than $92.00 (charged for a bill of that amount that was overdue by about 32 days).","296":"DO NOT USE BANK OF AMERICAI have small business and I have account with Bank of America,I deposited check for 1500 $ to cover my account because I purchase few things and My account was negative, I checked my back account next morning and I was surprised..they put my check on hold for 9 days and I have been charged 210 $ for overdrafting..I called them but I waste my time..I have been told different things and one option was to call my Cosumer and See if something wrong with her account.that is the worst thing you want to do with your costumesI meet her next day and she shows me that the check was cashed and the money was cleared from her bank..I felt so bad testing my costumers this way..and what for..to make this scams happy.time to stay way from BOAIf I could rate you with 5 potatoes I will be more than happy, I feel bad you still getting 1 star","297":"Recently I had some fraudulent charges posted to my card. A replacement card was requested by me via phone support on 10\/6. The replacement is reported to have gone out via regular USPS (7-10 day delivery) TODAY 10\/10, 4 days later. Previous replacement cards were sent via 2-3 day delivery. Waiting up to 2 weeks for a replacement card is unacceptable.","3198":"customer service terrible.   long long wait on the phone to talk to someone.   no way to email anyone.  the drive through people cannot help you.   bad.","298":"I need to comment on the outstanding customer service at the BoA branch in Bellview FL. The branch manager remembers my name even so i only stop in once a month. All of the staff their is extremely friendly and helpful. I hope that a regional manager recognizes their great customer service. I do.","3199":"This is to BOA credit card dispute department. I received a charge from **** magazine of $75.XX yearly subscription in August, which is higher than $49 stated in its magazine. I called **** customer service to cancel the unreasonable charge right away. Due to their management transition, the customer service line couldn't locate my subscription to cancel it. Therefore I called BOA to dispute this charge. BOA asked me to upload information on line in a timely manner. I uploaded the magazine page to show the credit card charged more than the magazine stated. To my surprise, BOA denied my dispute. I called BOA customer service immediately. The customer service representative promised me no worries, the charge will be resolved. No more action is needed. To my further surprise, I received another letter from BOA shortly to ask me for more information to support the dispute within a very short time frame. I was forced to call **** magazine again and again but due to their management transition issue, I can't get a cancellation letter within 4 - 8 weeks, which is longer than BOA's window. It means I'll be forced to pay the charge before the due date to avoid a late fee. I feel BOA does nothing to help except pushing customers to provide evidence. I won't contact BOA if I can resolve the issue between me and vendor. BOA, as an intermediary between the customer and the vendor, should refuse the charge from the vendor. I told customer representatives I'm willing to pay it if it's a reasonable charge. Unfortunately **** magazine is in horrible transition and wouldn't deal well with customers. BOA should stand by the customer's side to stop the unhealthy relationship with the bad vendor so that customer can use BOA's service to build a better relationship with other vendors. I'm very disappointed that BOA just keeps asking customer providing information in a very short time frame, in more demanding ways (from upload to on line banking to Fax or mail information to its *********). BOA is getting more and more unfriendly to its customers. It's not an amount I can't afford. But I'm very unsatisfied with BOA's attitude toward customer's dispute. I won't seek for BOA's help if I can resolve the issue with the vendor. Please think from the customer's point of view. Otherwise, you're losing your customers. ","2845":"Well well I have been member since 2003.  Meaning for 15 years I have paid these people and most of the time received positive response from them.  But today I must say I have a problem with them.  In my opinion they are taking the word of scammers over mine.  They want me to pay them for what another business charged to my account without my approval.  I am sorry I can't do it not this time. I have integrity and it is necessary to take a stand.  I am not paying for service I did not receive, that would be stupid.  I charge a lot and I pay a lot never had this problem.  So you need to do your job, because I am an excellent customer 15yrs.","299":"These guys are very good. Every time I walked into the branch, they remembered who I was and were always very helpful.

I have an overdrawn account and this bank just when a head a took my wife's entire paycheck with no warning and this is the money we needed to complete our rent money now we screwed. This bank is disgusting and really do not care for their costumers. Stay away from this bank!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I cant wait to be done a cut all ties with this horrible organization.","3201":"I affirm that every word written is true.  I willingly agreed to an online credit card at checkout from a website that I was booking travel in exchange for a discount off the fair and travel incentives. The credit was approved and charged immediately.  The amount charged was $128.50.  I affirm that I never received card within the mail. I received from them mail that looked like junk mail without anything identifying them as Bank of America. All of those mails were never opened and tossed with the other junk mail.  Recently, I received a mail from them CLEARLY IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES using their NAME\/LOGO stating that I owed them $256.99. I thought it to be spam until I called and became upset because I did not see any bills with a sender from Bank of America but received the collection notice with them being the sender.  Do note, at all times until I received the collection notice, that I didn't know who backed the online credit received when I was paying for my airlines ticket, nor did I know who to call, nor did I know that I was being billed because all looked like junk mail.  The matter was escalated and I agreed to pay the bill.  The manager told me that the bill was now $354.00 even from 3 months of not paying on the card.  Without hesitation, I paid the bill the same day that I received a clear NOTICE of a bill at one of their banking centers.  After I paid the bill, I was told that the account was already closed many days before I even received the mail. This puzzled me because I asked them to closed the account during the conversation, yet NO ONE TOLD ME THAT THE ACCOUNT WAS ALREADY CLOSED.  I am like wow!!!! How can they charge me late payments fees of $101.00, interest, and an additional  $97.01 dollars when they knew the account was closed.  So, in total, I was charged an additional $225.50.  I had to contact the credit bureau  to lodge a dispute after I paid the $354.00 in order to remove the late payment history.  I called back to the bank. The automated system said that I had a credit of $156.00.  I didn't need a credit on a closed account and it was $69.50 short from the $225.50 ($156.00 + $69.50 = $225).  At worse, it should have been an additional $10.50 more because the annual fee was $59.00.  My account was sealed such that I had to authorize the person to look at it after they sent me a text message. After he opened the account, his demeanor changed as he stated that he was reading the notes. I clearly stated that I was now recording the call.  I requested for  the monies owed to me to be sent to me after the bank employee confirmed that their system did not indicate that a refund was being sent out. I then asked for a  Letter of Satisfaction, which was already requested on the day the account was satisfied.  He said it be scheduled to go out.  I ask for written confirmation that the credit bureau was updated and he got short on the phone, but, said it was updated. It is MY BELIEF that it was updated ONLY because I initiated the action.  I then asked why was I charged more money on a closed account that was already sent to collection when I the consumer wasn't informed that it was closed.  He refused to answer and stayed silent the entire time .... the call held an additional 2 minutes and 12 seconds without him saying anything.  I wasn't put on hold.  I then recorded myself noting that the Bank of America employee refused to disclosed why $97.01 was added to a closed account within their collections department when the customer called to pay the balance of $256.99 .  I just wanted an explanation, even if it was, we are charging you interest for the first month and the annual credit card fee.... but, I didn't even get an explanation.  To add icing on the cake, I received on the same day of my final call with Bank of America (10-04-2018) another unidentified piece of mail from them exclusively going over late payment fees that will be charged, despite the card being closed already.  That was sent to satisfy  the CFCB on a complaint I made against them.  I learned two things: 1) always open every piece of mail going forth and 2) never accept online credit when you are at check-out to pay for travel or anything else.","1360":"On Friday, September 28th, I made a $670 payment, using the Square Cash App, but instantly canceled it because I sent it to an account that is no longer valid (person changed her phone number).

Well, today is October 4th and my funds are still being held hostage.I've called and spoken to like 10 people in their customer service line, and their basic message is TOUGH COOKIES!!!!. This whole week has been a struggle to put gas in my car, feed my 5 year old son, and just live life as a normal human, all because BofA decided that they will put a hold on $670 that was not sent to anywhere. Mind you, Bank of America didn't work for this money, I did!This is my money, and a product of my labor, and as such, I demand this theft to be corrected immediately!!!! I can provide the receipt of Cash App payment cancellation, as well as a letter which Square Cash asked for me to share with BofA stating to remove the hold as this was an instantaneous canceled payment....but they don't care!

I thought they was happy when getting their money in full. 2 days later they closed the account no letter nothing. Actually got the letter 15 days after they closed the account. A month later come to find out that they was charging me 34.00 dollars for interest. I closed all my accounts till this day i want nothing to do with this bank.

This is a horrible money hungry corporation. There were some overdraft fees. The money to cover it was in the account in less than 24 hours. As a matter of fact, less than 12 hours. Instead of waiving the fees, they charged the fees. They would not work with me in any way. When I said I would close my account, they agreed to drop two of the fees so I could close the account. But somehow couldn't work with me to leave an account open? It's a poor excuse for a customer service!

I called to ask that the Bank correct its error and reimburse me for the costs that it caused me to incur: a $29 insufficient funds fee assessed by my financial institution and the $27 returned check fee assessed by the Bank. The Bank\u2019s agents passed me from one person to another -- 5 all together -- over a period of 2 hrs, 11 min. The last one informed me that I needed to speak with an agent \"payment error inquiries.\" Each time I was passed, I had to start from scratch, including asking my wife, the cardholder, to authorize the agent to speak to me. No agent passed on critical information or explained that my wife had already given her authorization. The last agent, a supervisor, repeatedly spoke over me; he could not have been less helpful nor more bureaucratic. The problem remains unresolved.","3204":"Stay away, I am a 10-year customer to Bank of America and as of yesterday - I made a deposit, boa sent an email saying to call do to suspicious card activity (there wasn't any) upon placing the call I was told my account was closed.

I have since told my friends whom also have Bank of America and they have all agreed to close their accounts and move them elsewhere. I would advise you all to do the same.

Never easy with B of A! A call has to be made to the corporate office and the paperwork sent directly via the latest technology and despite what the court order says I have to fill out paperwork and am told that it will be 7 to 10 business days until I receive the check.

No check so tomorrow, if it comes, will be 21 days since I presented a court order for the \"immediate distribution of the assets.\" I wonder what they would charge ** if I was 21 days late with a payment? Also had issues accessing another account there and a safety deposit box.

They will sign you up for a long term contract and you won't be able to get out of it for a long long time. I closed my store last year and I called BOA Merchant customer service to close my account immediately after I shut down my business. They were unable to cancel my account unless I pay over $500 cancellation fee so now I'm stuck to monthly fees until next year. They should be more supportive of small business as we are the ones who work hard to make the magic happen ... but instead they will lure you in and if your business doesn't go according to your plan you will be stuck with long term fees.

BankAmericard denied the charge and put a block on my card use. Two hours later BankAmericard sent me a text saying that BankAmericard denied that charge and placed a block on my card because the charge at the restaurant was an 'irregular spending pattern.' Again, this is a restaurant in my neighborhood near my house and I eat there regularly. This was embarrassing and irritating. This happened in front of my family and friends with whom we were dining. To make it worse I am friends with the owners, as are my in-laws, and my kids went to school with the owner's kids. Even though you know someone you always wonder what is going on with someone who has his credit card use denied... This is the third time that this has happened.

I always file necessary complaints when I am treated bad in business. I finally received the money but they should be forced to pay interest immediately not after need in court. I am learning of global grants, heritage funds and other international business in banking. Obviously bankers aren't trained well in law beyond their own procedures.

The limits to what flights you can book are so limited, it's not even worth the companion fare option or the miles. And trying to upgrade using points? GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. Not a single ticket in first class can be booked if you want to upgrade. And for one flight I was trying to upgrade on, not a single ticket was booked, and they still wouldn't let me upgrade. And any money in your Alaska wallet to use for future use can't be used either. They just take your money and then treat you like you're asking for the moon if you want to use your money for anything than what you originally booked. Spending almost six figures on their credit card gets you nowhere b\/c you can't use your points due to all these restrictions.

So when I see a mysterious late payment show on my credit report I was in complete shock. I have never, ever made a late payment to any card! When I call to figure out what happened the rep apologized and said he would get it resolved. He didn\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t notify me that auto pay had expired but you have to re enroll every year? First time I\u2019ve ever heard of that but ok. He said he would submit a request to have it removed from my report. Someone would call me within the month to update me. I never received a call so I call back. Had to re-explain everything. This representative said that they were missing information on the request and filed it out with me again for a courtesy adjustment on my credit report. Was told someone would reach out to me again within the next two weeks with resolution. Again never received a call. Called back in today and had to wait on hold all over. Re-explain everything all over again. The representative had no idea what I was talking about. Customer service was absolutely poor. She told me I had to dispute with credit bureaus not them and they don\u2019t do adjustments or something along those lines. I wasn\u2019t disputing. I was looking to a courtesy adjustment because I was never notified and she just didnt seem to care. Canceled my card immediately after. Will never do business with BOA.

We have had several incidents where Money was overdrafted due to processing then fixed and having to fight them for their automated crap. Due to them not giving money on direct deposits from Amazon for a day or so we would wind up missing bills. They would tell us we could do nothing but wait for them to resolve disputed charges where some reason it was rang up twice for food. We would pay a 5 dollar safe checking fee on my account not my husbands to never have to worry about overdrafts and they would still do overdrafts. We called on multiple days, sat with several physical Tellers, managers, and supervisors, and even made them get on a three way merge call with my grandmother's bank for the current check having issues through them which is one of those checks you have to buy with money and is considered cash. It is very dissatisfying that our honeymoon was cut short due to the bank being unjust and not resolving or being able to verify over the phone when they had all these simple solutions they should have been able to do without their clunky software and locks. We did talk to several other banks who said that they can do that since each bank has its own policies but most banks would have had the money resolved since its been technically 4 days now. Due to all these issues we decided to pull our money and go to an alternative bank. Our families are doing the same which means they lost way more money then they anticipated. Please note if these regulations and computer systems they had in place were not 1s and 0s like black vs white answers then it would be a whole lot better but due to them not having one person be able to resolve issues without having to hold stuff forever or take a week to correct what the bank really has due to processing transactions. I swear they only update on a specific few days a week so your checking account is never accurate.On a positive note the application process is not bad and I didn't have much issues when i got my gender change with them changing the info and changing account types. They do try to keep you safe and lock accounts for activity that feels different from what they usually see but its all mostly automated. Sucks when you need to wait an hour for it to unlock again due to the fact that it autolocked from buying from a different store, site, or in a different state than it is usually active.

Now they have the fewest and farthest between when it comes to amount of locations. They clearly are taking advantage of customers and closing locations to recoup losses. The problem today was: they hit me wth 8 overdraft fees for declining a transaction 8 times. My account is negative a lesser amount than the 8 overdraft fees added up!

Now this guy was one of those \"deep researchers\" who doesn't let go of a subject until he digs up everything.  He discovered that Bank of America was not, in fact, our mortgage holder.  This was the time when Wall Street was turning mass numbers of mortgages into securities for the stock market (we all know how THAT went...). Bank of America was, in fact, a loan SERVICER, not the mortgage holder.  They received a percentage of proceeds when mortgage payments were made - when the account was current.  However, if that same payment was made on an account that was behind on their payment, BofA received FIVE TIMES the percentage!  They were literally telling people to go late on their payments so they could boost their own bottom line!!  I also later found out that the HARP program through BofA had a 99 percent rejection rate!!! So the master plan was, get people late on their mortgage, run them through the HARP red tape for a few months, deny their claim, then foreclose on them!WHY HAS NO BofA EXECUTIVE BEEN ARRESTED OR GONE TO JAIL FOR THIS??","1751":"I have had a B of A credit card for many years. I always pay my bills promptly. I did not see the e-mail notification of my bill last month and in consequence had a late fee of applied this month. It would have been good customer relations to waive the fee, but they refused to do so. The robotic insistence that the late fee must be paid was utterly depersonalizing. So be warned: years of loyalty are worth less to B of A than $23.88 (charged for a bill of that amount that was overdue by about ten days).","3297":"Vampires The Whole Bank. Awful. I\u2019ve been with them since 2009. Worst bank ever. They just want to suck you dry with unfair fees and stupid rules that make up for fun. Will never bank with them again and discourage everyone I know to ditch them and not use them.","1752":"After 2 hours of trying to locate a branch location and being sent to several different locations that used to be Bank of America but we're no longer owned by Bank of America I waited on hold to be directed to a bank 50 miles outside of my normal area to a branch was notified it was going to take me about an hour to get there and then the branch would be open called the branch themselves and found out that they were going to be closed within the next 10 minutes I strongly recommend using any other bank other than Bank of America as they do not seem to be concerned about anybody except for their own and her staff. If you do use Bank of America good luck pissing off every person that you have any type of banking transactions with","3236":"Prior to 2017, I had been a happy BOA costumer. Due to several billing and interest issues that BOA was unwilling to assist with, I have been making a strong consideration towards dropping them altogether. Whether it was their customer service, which used to be accommodating and amicable, current agents whom I've spoken with are 1) not able to have autonomy regarding individual client issue or 2) are not as well versed in customer service strategies. Either way, not only incorrectly incurred balances have occurred, but, when attempting to address the issue, the overall service has greatly diminished. It is worrisome and troubling as that was what set them apart from other banks, in my opinion. While general banking has been copacetic, any nuanced issues are not resolved. I hope this changes in the future, but it may be already too late for myself and other loyal customers.","3237":"Very convenient as far as locations go.   Terrible customer service and a penchant for creative fees.   ","1753":"It started with 30000 bonus miles offer. They are not going to tell you that you are going to get 30000 bonus miles or not. That is the trick. They didn\u2019t gave me this offer and I came to know this after 3 months when I called Alaska airline coustomer care. They told me it\u2019s not in our hand, you need to call BOA. When I reached nearest branch, they told me it\u2019s not in our hand. You need to speak with credit department. When I spoke with them, they told me you have applied for Alaska visa signature card but you are eligible to get Alaska visa platinum card. So unfortunately we can give you those 30000 bonus miles. So it is just trick to get more coustomer. Don\u2019t apply for this card by mistake.","3298":"Horrible Experience Banking Bank of America is the worse , they are liars, deceivers and can careless for their customers. They only look forward to the profit and money they gain. I have gone TWICE to the Bank of America in Brooklyn to retrieve my money from my saving account after closing the account with them. I closed the account because they charged an overdraft fee which I acknowledge. It was not an error, it was taken , I made sure I called them to explain that I had the money in another account but if I would have gotten an alert of the account being in negative at the moment I would have transferred money and the overdraft would not have happened.","1754":"I've been a customer of Bank of America for 7 years. For convenience, I've got all my banking with them - checking, savings, and two credit cards. I recently decided to move on because my experience with the credit cards have been awful. Constant declined transactions even after preemptively calling the fraud department beforehand (out of experience) to approve the transactions - so embarrassing. My cards will get frozen due to suspicious activity, but no text alert, no app alert, and when I call the fraud department, they have no idea why my transactions are getting declined as there is \"no freeze\". It's absurd. The last straw is that I have received about 8 new card replacements in the past 3 years due to it being compromised with a merchant. The sincere inconvenience this causes is ridiculous - I have bills, accounts, etc. that are linked to the card and will cause issues. I have never had these kinds of problems with my other cards, and, with the recent notification of yet ANOTHER replacement card being on the way, I am finally making the decision to break up with BofA.","3299":"One of Many Banks I opened an account with Bank of America when I was 18 and just stayed with them since. Since the start of my account, I opened two credit cards with them and are satisfied with both. Their mobile app is simple to use and a very clean design. I never had a problem with their customer service. Besides Bank of America, I also hold accounts under other financial institutes. But Bank of America still remains as my main financial institute.","1755":"I love Bank of America. They treat their customers with respect and are always willing to assist if an issue were to arise. I would recommend this bank to anyone. I have been with them for several years now and plan to bank there as long as they are around. Keep it up BoA, you are setting the standards and the bar is high. Thanks again.","1756":"As a BOA customer I thought his would be the best option. However, after using it to book travel for work and a vacation for my families I have 16,000 points which only earns me a whopping $160.00 credit toward my travel balance. Not worth it IMO.","1757":"Claim resolution is a sham. I had loved the Amtrak rewards card for years, absolutely loved. Then we had a vendor who did not refund money when we returned item. Bankamerica got involved, but after 60 days review then requested info (already given) and didn't give us time to get it to them...when we delivered a week later, they said we were too late, and no further recourse. In the end there's a rogue retailer that got merchandise returned and got to keep all the money. I've stopped using this card as a result of awful claims service.","1758":"Wish I could give zero stars. I was conned by BOA to open a BOA travel card which I did and I accumulated close to 48 Thousand points. Well this past Monday I called BOA to redeem my points and I was informed that I had to purchase the airline tickets first and thereafter i could receive credit for my purchase. Well, I called BOA this morning to inform them that I needed to redeem my miles and I was shocked to find out that my 48 Thousand points translated to a credit of 286 dollars based upon purchasing 3500 hundred dollars in airline tickets! I am closing this account and going back to the United Airlines Milage Plus Card ! Total disappointment !","3300":"Bank of America I've been using Bank of America for about a year now. I feel they're just like any other bank. They hold our money, it's seemingly pretty simple. I like using their app, it's easy and smooth. Their customer service is okay, but those wait times are normally pretty ridiculous.","1759":"I was wary of doing business with Bank of America. After my first year of membership in their credit card program, I called to cancel the card. I was very distressed to learn that they do not refund the $59 annual fee. This is unlike other airline reward credit cards such as Chase (United Airlines) and Citi (American Airlines) which offer an annual fee refund if you cancel the card up to one or two months, respectively, after it appears on your statement. I am disappointed in both Bank of America for establishing such a policy and in Spirit Airlines for doing business with a bank which utilized such a consumer unfriendly policy.","3238":"When you favor students over your veterans sad very sad \n\nChanging contracts without agreements is a big no no","3239":"Let me start off by saying I have been with BOA since 1995 and have had the cash rewards credit card for over 6 years. I applied for the Bank of America master card (the one with 0% apr for 15 months), and was only approved for $2,900. My old credit card had a limit of $7,000 on it, and I have always paid my bill on time, and had a good balance\/credit limit ratio. Plus my fico credit score is 738. I needed at least $9,700 on the new credit card total to be able to do the full balance transfer I needed to do. I was approved for an additional $1,900 on my old BOA credit card, which allowed for everything to work perfectly. I then transferred $7,000 over to the new credit card making my credit line, $9,900, and my old credit card line was then $1,900. This showed on my account for two days, and then the $1,900 disappeared without anyone reaching out to me. I had already made the balance transfer when I was approved for the credit limit increase. Now I am left with being unable to do the full balance transfer, which was the whole point of opening on this card. I have spend a total of almost 6 hours on the phone with different representatives, I have the phone records to prove it. Most of them couldn't care less to help me or do their job. I am so beyond frustrated at how BOA is willing to treat their customer of 23 years.","1180":"I had a CC with BofA with $17k limit. I received two promotional 0% APR checks in mail. I Had 0 balance and I took advantage of these checks and deposited $8.5k into my checking, since I need it. Therefore, I used 50% of my credit.A week later, they reduced my limit to 9k and closed my other cc as well! a month later, I noticed they charged my ~$170 interest fees as cash advance! I called them and they told me that I shouldn't deposit those checks in my own checking account and that's why they considered that as CA.Now My credit score dropped by 85 points and it's so difficult for me to pay this costly debt quickly. Avoid any products of BofA and leave them ASA you can. I opened a checking account with them with $10k and had 25k for some times, and still they don't trust me. I have accounts and cards with 40~50 banks and BofA is the worst ever.","3301":"A good bank to bank with Bank of america services are very good. Bank of America has a basic checking account and one that bears a minimal amount of interest.The internet banking offered by bank of america is easy to use. The user interface of the website is good and easy to use.The transfer of money from bank of america to another bank is made easy with it's internet banking .

They have had excellent customer service. I had a lot of questions regarding how to set up an account and the details of the account such as a minimum balance. I also had questions about a minimum opening account amount. I wanted my paycheck to be direct deposited, so I had questions. I had a lot of questions They were able to answer them honestly and answer a few questions that I did not think about. The agent was so patient with me. They were able to set me up with a checking account with very little trouble on my part. They issued me a debit \/ ATM card. I received this card in the mail in a reasonable time period. I use this account everyday without any problems. I will be banking with them from now on. Thank you","3240":"First of all this bank is obviously too big to fail.  With hundreds of thousands of customers if not millions feeding its greed with monthly maintenance fees and late charges with no one but mere pawns to utter company policy type language after \"Bank Hours\" when of course time matters the most, the machine of a business entity rolls on ignorantly avoiding responsibly bc they can with fine print, while penelizing every mishap that could be created or imagined with FEES.  How about We customers charge you a late fee.  The biggest issue I'd say is inevidable legal theft.  How can it be possible that in the 21st century the largest bank can hold a check deposited into an atm for 10 business days or more to \"verify\" it's legitimacy before clearing it for their own customer.  Most costumers have bills that are due weekly, monthly, dayly whom also have penalties for those companies if not payed on time let alone credit rating contingencies and more.  This proves that time is far more valuable than money and this particular bank seizes your check if deposited into an atm, then spits out a reciept \/ notice that says it will hold the check until the following month with a set date before releasing funds to your account 10 business days or more. This is the customers' money not yours! Customers are forced by availability and compliance into keeping funds at a more common bank in checking accounts in order to pay bills and conduct business transactions in some form other than cash for all types of crucial reasons. It's a domino effect and once your bank sits on their thumbs and says processing everything is left to speculation because Bank of America employees can't disclose the progression of the processing time period.  Bank of America! Stop excusing your legal theft with fine print! Make a call the following business day to the bank of record and verify the funds if you're so concerned as to the ligitimacy of any particular check deposit. DON't TAKE 2 WEEKS TO VARIFY CHECKS WHERE EVER THEY ARE DEPOSITED; WHETHER IN PERSON OR ATM!!!  THE CUSTOMERS OR \"MASSES\" OR \"NUMBERS\" IS SURELY HOW MOST OF BANK CUSTOMERS FEEL THEY ARE , HAVE BILLS TO PAY AND NONE OF US ARE GETTING RICH AS FAST AS YOUR ENDLESS FEES ARE MAKING YOUR ENTITY PER DAY MORE WEALTHY THAN IM SURE MOST COULD EVEN COMPREHEND!!!!! WOW!!! DO YOU REALLY THINK THE MASSES OF CUSTOMERS THAT FEED YOUR IGNORANT GREEDY FACE ARE THAT STUPID? 2 WEEKS TO VARIFY A CHECK!!! This is so sad. Just make a phone call to the other bank and verify. It shouldn't take two week to do so for any type of check! If it's fraudulent the use you technology to identify in less than 3 days.  Remember it's the 21st century and communication is supposedly instant., fiber optics, WiFi. The invention of the telephone without robots or answering machines to avoid responsibility. Email, texting, cameras, etc.. FIGURE IT OUT AND COMPANSATE ** FOR ALL THE PAIN YOU CUASE WHILE YOUR BANKS SUMITS ON ITS THUMBS TO VARIFY A MONEY THAT WILL MAKE OR BREAK US.  Remember folks don't always have gardens or yards or ways of survival for even just food. Money is how they  stay alive these days so don't **** with customers money that's not your banks money it's the customers money and you need to give them access to it within a very reasonable time frame from when they get payed or deposit into THEIR bank account not your bank account. This message is intended for the decision makers for the Bank of America whom ever you are. Read it and think about your actions on the planet.  They matter.","3241":"Taking Fees AFTER stating less than 24hrs late would not be a problem. Hit me with 2 fees $27 each. Noticed 2 months this was \"Said\" to be taken care of @ time of payment but still Charged over $110 for less than 24 hrs late worth of payments. FUDGE ON THEM GREEDY PEOPLE. I WILL KEEP MY MONEY ELSEWHERE. Policy or Not this is Crap!!","1181":"Amazingly BOA screwed up a simple balance transfer not once or twice but three times! Each representative I spoke with had a different response. Spoke with the supervisor and they offered no help. Just to simply submit for another transfer. Clearly, BOA is not concerned about keeping a long time customer. They have lost a customer that has had an account with them since 1986! THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU OR YOUR FINANCIAL NEEDS. I DO NOT RECOMMEND.","3304":"Not the best but not the worst For several years, I had my checking and savings account with Bank of America. It's an okay bank. It's not the best, but it's not the worst either. Customer service is usually fine, it really depends on who you get. Some are great, some are not. I remember one manager telling me that I had to have a \"consular\" ID, when my country does not even have consular ID's. The manager swore they did. Perhaps he was confused with another country. He was super rude to me. That was the last straw for me. I closed my account and went to another bank that has much better service, and ATM's everywhere. Another thing is that Bank of America has very few ATM's so you will find yourself having to withdraw money at other banks, which will cost you a lot in fees.","1182":"I had this card for 25 years and my biggest issue with this card is customer service and the way they treat a card holder, especially when you need their customer support the most. On those rare occasions when I had to dispute a transaction (total of 3 times within the 25-year period), this card has always sided with the merchant, no matter how wrong, no matter how frodulant that merchant was, no matter how much supporting documentation I produced and no matter how black & white the issue was. I found dealing with their claims department to be an insulting experience because of utter stupidity of their staff, including supervisors. And so, after a quarter of a century of being a loyal member I canceled this card. During the process of cancelling it there was not even an attempt from the rep to find out why I was unhappy with their product or service. $75 in annual fees is excessive, given the low quality of support you receive.","3242":"I received an escrow statement from Bank Of America stating that I have an projected escrow short fall of $336.98 for 2019. My escrow account was review at the beginning of 2018.   I contacted Bank of American in January and February 2018 and was informed that I didn't have a short fall in my escrow account for 2018.  All of my obligations were paid for 2018 from my current escrow account.   The account as of today, April 12, 2018, doesn't have a short fall.  All require payment from the account will be paid.\n\nI called Bank of American to find out why I received a letter about 2019 when we are still in 2018.  I spoke to a rep, in Phoenix, he informed me that my account was evaluated again using the projected insurance and tax amounts for 2019 and they arrived at this amount.  I asked the rep, was my current escrow account short.  He said no, the account was current.  I asked him how this assessment could be done again in this year when Bank of American has not received any bills for 2019.  \n\nI told the rep, if I paid this amount that was cause me escrow account to have an overage and that I didn't think that was legal.  How can I be expected to pay for a 2019 escrow short fall when the bills have not been submitted to Bank of America for 2019.  The rep transferred me to a manager, and we had the same discussion.   She informed me that there was nothing she could do.  She filed a complaint for me with the bank.\nThis is in my view, on the situation. It is a form of extortion because I am being forced to pay a debt that has not happened.   Bank of America doesn't have any bills to pay regarding my account for 2019.  They will hold my funds and millions of other customers as an asset to make loans and draw interest to increase their profits.\n\nI filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Federal Protection Bureau.  If you have this problem, I would advise you to do the same.\n","3305":"Good ideas, poor customer follow thru When we first started using Bank of America we loved them. Their website was great, very user friendly and easy to navigate. And honestly if we could have used Bank of America without having to use tellers, we might have kept our accounts with them. Every time we went in to make a deposit or withdrawal they would ask us if we wanted to sign up for a credit card or upgrade our account or something else every time! And we would kindly decline every time. And 2 weeks later it was the same story. Can you just put a note in our account that we're not interested??? No, they didn't. Every time we went we were asked over and over again. We liked the rates we had with our savings and checking accounts. We also liked how great it was that they had locations everywhere. We had a branch close to our home and all over the city that we lived close to, so it was always accessible if we needed it. As well as when we would travel to visit other family or go on vacations, but those darn questions every time were enough to drive me crazy. I finally switched banks and I've never been pestered with questions again.","3306":"Bank of America is so much better than my old bank I switched to Bank of America from a regional bank. The regional bank was really nice but unable to offer the ease of banking that Bank of America can. The website experience of Bank of America is absolutely incredible. It is very smooth and the amount that you can handle just on the mobile app is amazing. Signing up for my checking and savings accounts in a Bank of America branch was very painless. The customer service that I received from the employee was very good. She actually called and checked on what I thought of my banking service a few weeks later. I also really like the number of branches that are seemingly everywhere. I would oftentimes have difficulty banking with my old bank because they weren't located around where I was attending college. Bank of America does not have that problem.","1183":"Bank of America Cash Rewards Visa Card. I decided today to construct a list of all my credit cards and their purchase and cash advance rates. This would be useful in helping determine which card to pay off first and which card to use for future purchases. Other factors also apply of course (namely total cash back and cash back percentage).Of my 11 credit cards, I was able to find the purchase APR and cash advance APR quickly by perusing their websites (except for Amex. They made it difficult to get the percentage rates. It took me a few minutes longer. Amex had the highest purchase APR bar none! No wonder they gave me the run around).With Bank of America, the website told me to submit a request and they'll back to me via email or snail mail and stated that it might take them 3 to 5 business days to get this info to me. I was forced to navigate the labyrinth of their phone menus before finally getting a live person who gave me the rates.As it turned out, this card had the second lowest rate amongst my 11 credit cards. And they were trying to hide this from their customers? When combined with good cash back rates for gas & groceries, this makes this card number one in those categories. What a stupid, short sighted policy! Talk about shooting yourself in the foot! I mean most people wouldn't bother to spend the 30 minutes getting this info and just use the other credit cards.","3307":"Fine for a big corporate bank Bank of America is just ok. I like that they have ATMs everywhere; I also use BECU and it's harder to find a BECU ATM. Bank of America has charged me outrageous overdraft fees in the past, but now overdraft protection is linked to my credit card, which is a lower fee ($10 compared to $35). I've been banking with them since I was 16 and haven't closed my checking account because of comfort and familiarity I suppose. My main complaint with BOA is that a few years ago, I needed a new debit card for my account that I'd had for more than ten years and was told that I had hit a \"lifetime card replacement maximum\" and would need to close the account and open a new one, which is what I did. Turns out that this was probably a tactic so this teller could reach their new account quota because no one else has ever heard of this lifetime card maximum. I felt used and angry.","1184":"Classic BAIT & SWITCH! WATCH OUT Here\u2019s a HUGE info tip for all your readers\/followers: Recently applied for the Alaska Airlines Signature Card for my wife online. She\u2019d just passed the 5\/24 rule and her inquiries dropped to 2, so thought it\u2019d be a piece of cake, but \u2026 First, some info: Her credit rating is 813. We own two houses outright, and our net worth is $1 million plus. We have no debt, and have been banking with BOA for years. My wife also earns $50,000 a year, and teaches for a school district. So, you\u2019d think all would be easy, right? Filled out the online application, and BOOM \u2013 \u201cCongrats, you\u2019ve been approved\u201d - great, BUT \u2013 as I looked closer, approval was only for $1,000. Hmmm, so I started reading the fine print following the notice. Ready? It said any approval with less than a $5,000 limit WOULD NOT receive the \u2018Signature\u2019 card. Rather, they would be sending the \u2018Platinum Plus\u2019 card instead. No bonuses offered under the \u2018Signature\u2019 card would be honored. SO, classic \u2018BAIT AND SWITCH\u2019 by BOA. I\u2019ve called to get the issue resolved, but as of yet BOA\u2019s only answer was: We can\u2019t disapprove without issuing a lower card \u2026. Or something like that. Meanwhile, I\u2019ll just need to cancel the card if I\u2019m not satisfied. Oh, and the inquiry is now logged, and my wife\u2019s credit was knocked slightly. It\u2019s more the principle of the whole thing.","3243":"This is why, back in October I purchased concert tickets. I go to a lot of concerts and know how to not buy fake tickets. That is not what happened. When I arrived at the arena, we were told there was a huge ticket scandal(about 400 people) and they gave us a letter to give to my bank to get a refund. The letter stated the tickets were fraudulent. A few days later I send my letter the the claims department via mail, and the charge drops off. I thought I was in the clear. 2 months later, the charge is back. I take my letter to the bank and have them fax it to the claims department to ensure they receive it. They gave me the receipt of the successful fax and tell me it should be in my account soon and sorry for the inconvenience. Another month goes by and I receive ANOTHER letter saying my claim is closed because they never received proof even though it was faxed from the branch on Canton hwy. I returned to this branch and the associate I deal with is extremely rude, and basically tells me there is nothing they can do but they will stand by while I get on the phone with the claims department. After being on hold for 45 minutes, I get on the phone with a supervisor that wants the fax sent straight to him so he can make sure it's taken care of. I thought this was finally being handled. They send the fax and I'm told he will call me back tomorrow to follow up. I received another successful fax receipt. 4 days go by and I get no phone call. So I call the claim center again, they state they have no records of me calling, sending or filing anything. ALSO, the claim is now too old to be reopened. So now I am out 200 dollars because my bank can't seem to send a fax and failed to have any sort of customer service. There is no reason that after 3 attempts of getting this sent to my claims center that it should be put as my fault that the claim is now expired. It wasn't expired when I tried the first 3 times. I've been with Bank of America since I graduated high school and planned to stay long term as I buy a house, car, etc. but now I have taken my business elsewhere. I will be submitting this as a review on other media sites as well. I hope this will be addressed. Thank you. ","3244":"In the past I was happy with Bank of America, right up until I had to dispute a fraudulent credit charge with them.  I provided them everything they requested to dispute the charge but in the end, they decided to lie and said I did not provide them what they requested and that they closed the case and I still had to pay the fraudulent charge.  I kept copies of everything I sent them (via fax and mail) and I reviewed it and I had in fact gave them everything they requested about the charge.  The bottom line is, they have no interest in protecting their customers from fraud.  Do not believe anything they say in regards to you being protected from fraudulent charges - the truth is, they will do everything within their power, including lying, to make you responsible for everything that happens to your account(s).","3308":"Effective Banking I have been a Bank of America customer for over 12 years. I have checking, savings, and a credit card through them. What I like most about them is the convenience. Specifically their website. I pay off my credit card by just transferring money from my checking into my credit card. It is a simple click of the button. I get alerts when my accounts are low, when my card is used, or when a bill is due. It is so very convenient. The downside to Bank of America is the fees. You must know how much money you need to keep in each type of account, or else you will get fees at the end of the month. Another problem is the low interest rates on the savings account. However, the convenience factor more than makes up for this. I hope this review is helpful to anyone considering using Bank of America.

They lost all my business because they refused to credit me back $22 of fees in last 2 months that I never agreed to nor was made aware of at any time. It's ridiculous as all accounts used to be free before. They make so much money from us for all transactions we make with merchants and with the money we have in the banks. As the big banks bought all the little banks, the big banks talk together and now decided to charge us for everything as they have kind of a monopoly that way. I think Credit Unions are the best option at this point.","3247":"BofA customer support is useless, no help in resolving issue with account once their has been a charge created against your account. You gave to wait until the transaction is complete (Money gone) then they want $25 to cancel the transaction. Also another note you are also out any overdraft fees.

I ordered a gown online in December of 2017 for an Art Basel event, I contacted the merchant via email to let them know that of this dress was not going to be delivered before this event that I would liketo cancel this order. The merchant  (*********) mailed the dress late anyway and proceeded to take payment for the dress. I notified Bank of America that I canceled the order with ******** and would like the charge taken off. I ended up ordering another dress on Amazon.com which got here before the Art basel event..\n\nIt is now March 2018 and BOA TOTALLY dropped the ball on this one.. \n\nThey attempt to deliver the dress and I refuse the package as I already told them to cancel order and they insisted to send ** it anyway..

(I am 50\/50 with everything). Bank of America fraudulently approved this form illegally without reading the trust documents. In order to fix this issue, I have had 5 separate phone calls, 1-3 hours each. All they have to do is add my name to an account (I've provided 100 pages of trust documents, SSNs, death certificates, etc.) I've driven to their office 4 times and followed every single instruction they gave to the T. (Many times they provided us contradictory instructions - something different with every phone call.) Even after all this I am no closer than when I started and I have to get lawyers involved to access my own money. I am unable to access over $100,000 because of Bank of America's fraudulent actions!

Recommendations take your business as far away from BOA as possible. I pulled every account I had after several errors which Bank of America would not own up to more than 15  years ago.  When we purchased our first home we had it written into the contract that the loan could not be sold to Bank of America.  Well it was transferred to Countrywide\/Wells Fargo then to Bank of America.  It has been a nightmare from the get go.  Do not  mail payments because they conveniently and consistently lost. They have held payments for up to 96 days after clearing my bank before posting them while charging late fees. Will not clear the fees.  Not paid my taxes two separate occasions. Not paid my homeowner insurance two separate occasions. Lost the escrow accts, Had the home in Washington listed as a condo in Mexico.  Then out of the blue started receiving my statements in spanish this took 9 months to clear up.  Posted payment to someone else acct. They document nothing so its pointless to call and follow up on an issue. Take payments every month to a local branch so I have a paper receipt to prove their in ablity to keep any kind of records. Stanwood Branch dates the payments for the next business not the day they receive payment. Received foreclosure notice 3 days after a payment that was on time.  3 days folks! Ive stopped calling when there is an issue but cause frankly I'm afraid of what will come next.  Today was my final straw I got another collection call because once again they have lost my payment that cleared my CU just hours after making the payment. Its up to me to prove I made the payment but you can not go to the local branch to have them straighten anything out they don't have the authority or access your records.  \nBBB that is some fuzzy math 167 reviews 161 negative 4 pos 2 neutral is a A- rating.

Why did I have to call twice, to close a credit card when there was documentation sent to close it. Why after 3 weeks when the amount due was paid in full did I have to call to have a residual interest balance waived. I never had issues using the card but any time I had an issue the customer service was abysmal.","3251":"In 2009 I fell on hard times do to my wife at the time. Long story real short. I had to leave my home. BOA contacted me at least once a week for over a year telling me they were going to foreclose. I PLEADED with them TO foreclose. They never did. I finally was able to save enough money to hire a attorney to have my wife evicted. The lawyer contacted her with an eviction date at which time the house was gutted of everything worth any value. Pipes, heating system etc. I called BOA and told them and they sold the loan two weeks later. Then I called the people they sold the loan to and informed them, they sold the loan. the hose was finally foreclosed on in October of 2016. I lost my home.","3309":"Frustrating fees I have been with Bank of America for many years. I first got an account right out of college because they had a promotion for newly graduated students. Since then I have been reasonably happy with this banking institution. The best thing about it is that it is a national bank, so I'm never lacking for a nearby branch. The promotion for my checking account expired a few years after I opened it, and I was switched to a regular checking account. It is fine, though I do have a monthly fee now, which is frustrating. I'm honestly thinking about moving to a credit union in order to bypass this monthly fee, even though it could potentially mean scarcer branch locations. I'm still chewing on that, but I'm sure eventually I'll move on.","3312":"Bank of America Banking at Bank of America has been a pretty good experience for the most part. They were the first banking institution that I opened a checking account with. I was soon offered a credit card within a relatively short period of time. Customer service has always been very nice and helpful. I do believe that for the majority of my time banking with them, their site has been a little difficult to use. The design was a bit cluttered and complicated. I do believe that they've since updated to a more simple and user friendly design. I also had an issue with overdraft fees due to fraudulent transactions made on my account. The issues were later resolved but the fact that such large amounts were consecutively taken from my account when no money was left to use did make me worry.","3310":"Highly Recommend I have banked with Bank of America for over 10 years now. I would highly recommend them to friends and family. I have a regular savings and checking account, and had a money market account until it was switched over. The best thing about Bank of America is the convenience. At any time of day I can transfer funds from one account to another. I can pay bills automatically online and never have to write out checks or pay manually. The interest rates are not great, but the convenience is the most important thing to me.","3311":"Not told the right infomation When I first opened my checking account four years ago I was told about the fee, but was given the wrong information. I wouldn't be charged the fee if I was using the online service. The first couple months I wasn't charged the fee because I had over thousand dollars in my account which is one of the thing you have to have not to be charged the $12 monthly fee. I was going to the store to pay diapers for my son and I checked the bank. They had taken the $12 fee for the first time. Because of this I couldn't go right then to buy the diapers because my account was short what I need. I called the bank to figure out what was going on. They explain that I was charged the fee because I didn't meet the monthly requirements not too. I explained that I was told that if I had the online account I would not be charged that fee. I was then told that I was wrong and that they were sorry. I broke into tears telling them that because they took that money I was unable to buy my son diapers. They gave me back the money that time, but informed me that it would come out again next month.","3313":"The best bank It is a great bank. The truth is I am very happy with your service, offers security, many opportunities, facilities in transactions, possibilities regarding the credit issue. I really have several years with this bank and I can catalog it as the best. Always alert. The web platform is great and easy to use, the physical venues are comfortable and coherent with the operation of the site, transparent, which is the most important thing in a bank, transparency. This bank has never been bad for me.","1188":"BofA charged 30 dollar fees and they did not give the service as payment was clear. I have charged the fees which I have not get the benefit and customer care said this is my mistake :( . this is really frustrated experience and no benefit to customer.","3252":"As the BBB is updating BOA Mortgage Servicing I am forced to post this review under BOA general.  So after my mortgage being at Bank of America for years, I learned it was transferred to Carrington Mortgage Services LLC.  I received my first invoice for payment less than 10 days before it was due resulting in an online payment that cost an additional $5.00.  I signed up for automatic payments, which takes 2 months to be effective in today's electronic world.  I pay extra principal each month.  I went with the bi-monthly payments.  The confirm page showed the mortgage P&I with escrow divided between the 1st and 15th of each month and the extra principal amount divided in half for each payment.  I then received a confirmation letter that stated everything above, but the extra principal payment amount was cut in half of what I requested.  When I called the customer service number they stated they do not have access to those numbers.  How can they not have access to my automatic payments when I set them up through their webpage?  Customer service is less than helpful and fails to answer the question asked.  Even if they understand the question, the response is they don't have access to my mortgage account details.  Nice of Bank of America to sell this mortgage to this company so I can waste my time on the phone with them and my time refinancing just to get away from Carrington.  To be far to BOA, this review is also being posted on Carrington's review, but make no mistake it was BOA that started this entire process in motion.","3314":"Amazed at the ATM My Bank of America account continues to impress me. The online banking is really convenient and easy to use. I like that I can deposit checks at home by taking pictures of the check. What really impressed me was depositing cash at an ATM for the first time. I just stuck a stack of money in the slot and the ATM counted the money extremely fast and accurate. I wonder how they got a machine to do that? Bank of America has excellent identity theft measure too that are automatic. If I am out of my usual spending area, they send me a message asking if I am still in possession of my card.","3253":"I went to BOA today (03\/15\/18) to deposit a check ( thats I was not able to deposit through the mobile app) and to withdraw some money from the ATM machine.

I was finally able to deposit my check but I was unable to withdraw some money.\n\nI went to speak to the Relationship Manager, ******* *****, and she told me that someone was coming to fix it. I asked her why that ATM machine has a different problem every day, and she responded in a mocking manner that it was the machine's problem and the machine is serviced by a third party. \n\nI asked her again why the machine has constant problems as every time you go to a teller, they ask you to use the ATM instead. She insisted that it wasn't the bank's fault. She was very evasive and didn't seem like she cared at all that customers face a continuous problem with that branch. It is very disappointing!","3315":"Online banking has been a dream for me! Online banking with Bank of America has been an absolute lifesaver for me! It has saved me so much time and trips to the bank I am unable to even count. I frequently have checks to deposit, and you are now able to do this from online or your mobile device. You can literally just snap a picture of the check image and it will be verified and posted to your account. You also have the option to easily add a company or person to your billpay account and pay electronically or via check. I have not had to physically write a check in over 2 years thanks to this service. I am also able to easily transfer money between my accounts with Bank of America, including my savings! I also am able to easily send money to children. Would highly recommend!","1189":"I have had my account with BOA for more than 13 years. They are fine if you dont mind having your card cancelled repeatedly for possible fraud that they will not disclose to you, if you have ANY issue whatsoever and tend to be someone who has an above shoe size IQ, or for that matter ... if you aren't someone who enjoys blatent lies, deception, and behavior that any passive aggressive would admire.I spent 6 hrs on the phone and 1 hour at the branch today to try and fix what 1 hostile employee fid to ruin my account.

WHAT??? A bank turning down a large deposit. Hmm... something's very wrong.  \nSo I called the corporate office and spoke to a customer service rep named Brian W***** who was very pleasant and said he was just as shocked as I was. He helped me file a complaint and said he would let the upper management know as this is not company policy.  Yet I understand the company has chosen to reduce staff in all branches and they don't allow for back up when one person goes to lunch. Business just stopped because they only had one teller on the line. Even though there are several other bodies standing around. I left and deposited my money elsewhere.\nWhat happened to good ole \"customer service\" but  I guess the other complaints on this  website about Bank of America answers that.  It's just not a priority!!  If enough people take the time to speak up maybe someone will listen ...like the B Of A President Brian M******* (President and CEO).  I'm going to try and see if one person can make a difference.  To be continued.","3255":"Was a customer for nearly 15 years and am glad to finally move on. High and easy to incur fees. Got pushed out of my free savings account some time ago. Had an ebanking checking account (free checking as long as transactions weren't made through a teller) and they suddenly stopped offering the ebanking account with no notice- I had just ordered new checks. I got to use one of the checks. Complete waste of money. Everything I had was hooked up to this account; direct deposit, bill pay, and the like. It was inconvenient to have to change, but I am glad Bank of America forced my hand. They would waive the checking fee if I kept a certain balance in the account (I don't keep high balances in my checking account- I use it strictly for bill pay) or if I had a certain amount direct deposited into the account. I bartend and my pay checks were direct deposited, but I get paid weekly, and they are not large checks, so it wasn't enough to cover. Third choice was having some obscene amount of investments through Bank of America. I would suggest no one use Bank of America, you are truly a number and a bottom line and are never treated any differently, no matter how long you Bank with them. ","3316":"Bank of America online, is OK For the longest time, I had serious troubles with the mobile version of the app. There are really annoying situations that require changing your password over and over. The account security is redundant. Also, it is really difficult to send money between accounts, especially on the mobile version, making it to where I had to go to the physical bank to pay my credit card bill. Super annoying app, and I don't think they're ever going to fix it.","3318":"Online Banking I've used Bank of America for over 10 years and they have added the online banking feature. I use this to check all my checking and savings. If I never need any help, I can use the online chat, which is very helpful if I'm at a place where I can't chat on the phone. They are usually very responsive and helpful. I've never had an issue with them. For example, if I need to dispute a charge, I can do it online and it gets resolved very quickly.","3317":"Decent enough, lots of branches The best thing about Bank of America is how many locations. Wherever I am, it has always been easy to find an ATM or a branch if I need help. However, the fees on the new checking accounts are not great. It's possible to get better rates and lower fees at the local credit unions.","3319":"poor banking experience Bank of America has outrageous fees, including overdraft, monthly maintenance, and ATM. overall I will be switching banks in near future. although bank of America customer service is great, i'd still rank the bank at 6. below my expectation.","2851":"I am trying to help an elderly aunt with her account after a fraud event and it is impossible to get through to a human.","3320":"Not bad, Not Great I first switched to Bank of America checking when Washington Mutual was bought out by Chase and its free checking was killed off. Bank of America had a free checking in the form of eChecking account. This lasted a while and was functional until Bank of America killed it off only keeping it free and without fees with the usual minimum balance of direct deposit. While I was able to avoid fees, its the principle of the matter so for a time I considered Bank of America good but not its becoming more and more greedy. Its website and general features are fairly functional. Its the only Bank i know of that has a App for Windows 10 devices allowing me to use my laptop and its camera to deposit a check versus a phone.","860":"PLEASE,PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS HOLY! AVOID THIS CARD AT ALL COST! I understand limited spots per flight for card holder discounts,but if i go a full 9 months ahead, to the point where they stop taking reservations, and find not a single flight at that rate,I think FRAUD! there are no benefits to this card. Even the \"Preferred Boarding\" is a joke. Being that it is honestly the least organized of all carriers, boarding is free for all with no loading zones enforced. I am cancelling my card as I write this review. I have had the card for 4 years and saved my points only to have nothing resembling a benefit.

When opening up a new account, customer service workers were clear, personable and accommodating; the transaction was completed by a representative a matter of a half hour. I also appreciate the convenient online features provided by this bank, such as mobile deposits and electronic money transfers, which have saved me a lot of time (for instance, I pay rent electronically every month directly from my checking account). I've never had a problem with any of these features, which is great. My only complaint is the monthly fee ($12.00, which seems kind of high) and the fees incurred by withdrawals from other banks' ATMs; however, this issue is avoidable most of the time. Overall, the customer service and convenience of mobile\/web features has given me a pleasant experience with the institution, despite some of the fees.","3258":"I always pay my credit card balance off in full each month. I've done so for years. However, I recently broke my arm. Among the stress of having surgery and doing physical therapy after the surgery was done. I missed my payment due date by four days. Bank of America, of course, instantly hit me with a large fee. I called their 1-800 number to see if the fee could be reversed. The phone service said the wait would be between one hour and fifteen minutes and two hours and thirty minutes. This seemed absurdly long. Fortunately--or so I thought--it offered an option where BoA would call me back when I had reached the front of the extremely long hold queue. I chose that option. However, when the call back came, it only let the phone ring once before hanging up. So I had to call the 1-800 number and get back in the queue. I've now been waiting for one hour and five minutes, and am still on hold. I don't know that I ever will speak to a representative. But I do know that I'm going to find a different credit card. Other cards have better cash back offers anyway.","3259":"This bank has policies designed to steal your money.  After 8 years, i'm closing all accounts.  Will never deal with these thieves again.

I enquired about mobile deposits clearance time and Bank of America's reply was 1 business day so I went ahead to deposit the check on the phone app and even a technician guided me and assured of the promptly time it would take for the funds to be realised. Next day I checked the status and the check would not be realised until 10 days later. I called technical support a few times and they say that I could either expedite or cancel the deposit if I take the original check in person to one branch but technical support is unable to cancel over the phone. Once again I trust and take Bank of America's word for granted and I showed up in person to the Hollywood Branch where an associate tells me that there is nothing they can do even if I show up with the check- all that it is done is to connect me to customer service. I wait on the phone for 16 minutes and I explained that I am at the Hollywood location but they refuse to help me and the woman on the phone refuses to cancel the deposit- then a bank manager also refuses to cancel the deposit or expedite it since I have the original check.\nThe check was legitimate from a good company and Bank of America's practices were misleading for there was a discrepancy of information among its members. This is unaceptable for the check should have never been put on hold for so long.

First of all, that name does not represent America (it should be changed) because it forces people to take bad loans in efforts to profit the institution. I am stuck with a balloon second mortgage loan, which was never discussed at closing. As I am getting close to the term of the agreement, a letter was sent by the bank and the word balloon came up in big bold letters. When I called to get a clarification of what the \"balloon\" stands for; I was told that it is an interest only type of mortgage. My understanding was at the end of the term of the mortgage, I would be finished paying for the loan. This was a $69,000 loan and 13 years later, I still owe $55,000. Two more years to go to complete the term in which I taught to have a ZERO balance.Lesson learned, some banks cannot be trusted as they are greedy and will take advantages when possible. The government has now established regulations to punish banks that continue such practices.Be alert with mortgage transactions with Bank of America and those alike. Please read the agreement carefully and ask questions. If you feel something is wrong, go with another bank. Usually smaller banks offer better terms, and they are not as aggressive and greedy for your hard earned money.-Garry","863":"I have a refund in limbo at this bank for two weeks because they will not credit it.This caused all kinds of havoc in my account.

Then I am told because the 20 put the account in the negative, that is why we were charged 35, bit you NEVER paid the 20.. Not happy at all,  I will be getting an attorney, your bank has stolen money from my family way to many times! ","3324":"The service has gotten worse. I used to love this bank because they had great customer service and you could get a representative on chat. However within the past year you can never get anyone on chat and when you call customer service the hold time is very long .So that makes it very frustrating to get help when you need it . I wish they had better service and then I would be much happier","3325":"Terrible Service I have been cashing mine and my boyfriends check for over a year now through BofA without any problems at all, tried to do the same for a friend who needed help and the check cleared half as if everything were normal and then the entire check is taken back out of the account, multiple overdraft charges and an embarrassing encounter trying to buy food and getting declined (and being unable to buy food for two days was another nice ancillary detriment) is leading me to close my account and let everyone and anyone I can know how downright awful this bank is. Do not bank with them.","2853":"I like B of A.. have been a customer since 1977.  Very happy with the service.","3270":"Bank of America locked our daughters account now for 68 days after her wallet was stolen.  We supplied them with police report and all required documentation as requested.  Despite false promises and completely unreliable personnel we are still not getting any results.  Involving a manager did not give any momentum in solving this case.  Truly a bank that should close its doors - it is a shame how they do not stick to their promises.  Do not support bank of America","3269":"They told me that they wont ever open an account for me because of an entry from another bank from 2009. This is BS because I didnt commit NO crime whatsoever. Even though its past the 7 year mark of being deleted, they said it was a business decision. Now they are in the toilet as I speak.","3271":"I am seriously considering changing banks. Bank Of America has been my bank that I have a credit card with and checking and savings for years. I was with ******** and ************* when I was a teenager and has changed names until now is BOA. The customer service representatives and managers are not trained to be empathetic. I made a mistake with my checking account and realized I was overdrawn by .65 cents. I knew all of my transactions had cleared and would be ok until Friday when my paycheck would be direct deposited. However, the next day it went to a different that is still a mystery as to how due to the fact that all my bills had cleared already. Plus the infamous $35 overdraft fee. I called for an explanation to which I never got. They were insinuating that I was lying about having just a negative .65 cent balance. I actually had a screenshot of the -.65 but of course they didn't want to see (or couldn't) my screenshot as proof. I realize it was my mistake for being overdrawn and obviously do not have a lot of income. The customer service rep and manager was condescending in the manner in which they spoke to me. As a long time customer I have seldomly been overdrawn before and have been given a courtesy adjustment in the past. I do not make a habit of overdrawing or asking for a credit for the fee. It is a shame that the customer service of such a large company cannot be more empathetic to their good, loyal, long term customers. I am closing my savings account for sure. I will be seriously considering changing to another bank and I will be speaking negatively to anyone wanting to become a BOA customer.","3326":"Love the online capabilities I love the idea of being able to track my expenses, not only on the web page but on my phone. I'm able to create a budget at the same time that I receive different tips and tricks to maximize my savings. Before using this I had to use different apps or link my account to another app. They have always being very kind when I need some help, additionally, getting new products has always been really simple. Considering the products, my savings and checking account are pretty straightforward, not sure if other banks has this but it transfers every week a certain amount of money from checking to savings, making Saving money something really simple. Oh, I've had some issues with duplicated cards, they've been really helpful. Immediately, without many questions I've gotten my money back.","3272":"So a few nights ago I went to a BoA ATM to deposit some cash into ** account, while at the ATM I realized the reposting transaction was taking a little longer than normal. Next thing I noticed the ATM was saying out of service and then it started to reboot. I immediately called the number on the ATM to report an issue, waited on hold with no answer. During this time I was still at the ATM waiting for it to reboot so I could hopefully get ** card back out..Sure enough after a 30min wait (actual time) it rebooted and no card. After being on hold for 40 minutes I got a rep. only to lie to ** basically. She told ** unfortunately I could not get ** card back, I would have to go to a branch to request a new one. Well I work 8am to 8pm basically so ** chances of that are impossible. I told her that, oh well we can mail you a card but that takes 3-5 business days. Note all ** money was in ** checking and savings account that I now have ZERO access to! She ended up telling ** oh you can go to a virtual teller atm and withdraw ALL ** available funds. The nearest one was 19 miles away. I drove to it only to be told they needed 2 ID's with I said okay I have ** DL and a major credit card. The teller told ** it HAD to be a BoA credit or debit card!!! Knowing that ** card was just taken by the ATM! She talked to a supervisor and told ** okay but they can only give ** a certain amount out of ** account because I will hit ** daily withdraw limit. She insured ** I can go back the next day to withdraw more. I was okay with this took what I could and waited for the next day. So afterwork once again I drive 19 miles to this virtual teller ATM and went through this process again. Only to be told a different story. That since I did not have an atm card and ** major credit card is enough proof with ** DL I cannot withdraw ANY MONEY! Even though the night before with a supervisors permission I got money out! She continued to argue with ** that she had no idea why they were able to give ** money because they cannot through their system. So I wasted ** time, ** gas. putting 19 miles on ** car one way for no reason. Glad I Zelle'e money to ** husbands Chase account and canceled ** BoA account for good! I am now happily banking with Chase and never again deal with Bank of America!","3273":"They are so NOT about the customer. I've been a banking customer for over 25 years and have had a business account with them, for over 15 years. I received notice they are closing ** business credit card - and no reason. Then, last night I went to use ** business debit card and it didn't work. I called and they said they closed ** business checking account. No notice, no reason, except we can close any account at any time. That is all they will tell **. They are NOT about the customer. I think they are closing ** business accounts because when they gave ** a business credit card, they opened an extra account, without ** authorization. I believe they are cleaning up before they become a wells fargo.","3274":"Asked the Relationship Manager ****** if it's normal to always have a line that's over 45 mins. He said it is and it will keep happening. This isn't a team he said we have separate jobs. Horrible customer service 2 tellers for a line that's to the door. This has gotten me to be so infuriated more than I can count!  That at the end of this line I will be finally closing my account. Thankfully this will be my last time in line. Doesn't seem like this branch cares so what the point of keeping the account. Teller **** was more successful in being professional than the managers.\n********* *****\nXXXXXXXXXX","864":"I have had a B Of A account for over 35 years. They have nothing but fair to me. I would give them 10 stars! When my husband lost his job we racked up a lot of fees from auto payment. They waived most over them for financial hardship. I felt they were extremely compassionate and non judgmental.","2854":"Im hoping for better results","865":"I love it. No annual\/foreign fees, good points on all purchases, good support, convenient online banking. Never had issues if setting travel alert ahead. Easy points redemption as travel credit. Additional cards for authorized users (my kid using it overseas while on exchange program, my spouse travels with additional card, no need for separate one). It covers most of my needs - the only other travel thing you need besides Americard is a no-annual-fee penalty-free debit card to use at foreign ATMs (something like CapitalOne360 mastercard)","3327":"Banking Experience Bank of America provides a very easy user friendly experience. The ease of access makes it simple to open deposit accounts and\/or for business. The customer service department is knowledgeable and ready to help customers with any questions they may have regarding their accounts including, transactions, transfers and other financial aspects of the account\/s in question. Bank of America is a proven leader in the banking system most would say. The mobile platform offered by this bank is easy to use and secure. Without many fees and the ability to avoid fees for such things as maintenance, by doing simple tasks during the month which most customers do on a regular basis anyway makes saving on fees seem even more rewarding many may say.","3275":"Accessed BofA offer through ******* ****** which offered a BofA HELOC with 4.08% interest rate, zero fees and zero prepayment penalties.  Loan officer, ****** ******* ******* CA, was the contact - spoke with him and confirmed the rate and terms, and that the rate quoted was not a teaser rate. Based on those representations, I agreed to have my credit pulled and the application started. My next BofA contact was about 4-5 days later, I spoke with ****** (?) ****** at X-XXX-XXX-XXXX xXXXXXXXX, and the terms significantly changed. Interest rate was now prime + 50 basis points, there was a contingent prepayment penalty if the loan was closed in the first 36 months, and there was a $100,000 mandatory draw down at closing.  I asked why these did not match what was represented to me before and she was unable to explain. These were not acceptable terms and I halted the process. I was induced to allow my credit to be pulled, hurting my credit score going forward, based on false expectations. emailed ******, who did not respond.","3328":"A good bank to bank with I have been a loyal customer of Bank of America for over 8years.

Transaction did not go through and it was immediately canceled, yet the $199 amount is still \"pending\" in my Spirit World MC at BofA! 7 days and still pending after it was immediately canceled upon transaction attempt! Called Spirit twice and spoke to rude agents from other countries who put the blame on BofA. Called BofA 3 times in past week and listen to them say it's Spirit's fault! Just now was told could take 14 BUSINESS days to fall off! LOL.... Funny how it only takes them a few hours to receive my payment but weeks to cancel a transaction that was CANCELED!I've had this card for couple years and use it monthly to purchase flights. This is first time I had this problem. Sucks!","3276":"I wasted time going through the phone system. Chat won't work either. Closed at 3PM on Thursday? Never again would I ever deal with them again.

Very exciting.I waited until Dec 26th to start checking my account hoping that the companion fare was added each day. I finally contacted Alaska airlines to find out when to expect the companion fare, so I could plan accordingly for booking our trip.I was told that I would receive the companion fare after my credit card statement closing in the middle of January.This delay and issuing of the companion fare by Alaska Airlines has affected pricing for our trip and therefore the dates we will be able to take our trip and we no longer will have the ability to use, the then expired, free 1st class upgrades.We all have relationships in this world, weather with our significant others, the businesses we deal with or if we are a business, our customers.Usually if you're giving a gift for your anniversary, three weeks after your actual anniversary, things don't go very well.Each of us decides how important the relationship is and how important that anniversary is.It is apparent by their actions that Alaska Airline doesn't put too much importance on the relationship with their credit card customers and their anniversary date.I just think other consumers need to be aware of where you stand with Alaska airlines before signing up for their credit card.","3329":"Bank experience Very easy to work with. Reasonable and good interest rates. Their customer service is very good too. Never had to wait for a long period of time while on the phone and got the answers I was looking for right away.","3330":"Bank of America I've really enjoyed my time as customer of Bank of America. They are a great bank because they provide excellent customer service. They are usually busy but they do their best to see you quickly. They offer a lot of helpful services. They have even offered me a credit card with them. The workers are always friendly and they always greet you with a smile.","869":"Have score of 700+ and after 7yrs as a checking finally approved for credit card, the credit approval process could be better for for the available credit limit, really wasnt worth the extra inquiry applied to my credit score.","3278":"I have never experienced anything so horrible in ** life!! I cannot get a mortgage because of what they promised to do! My ex was to take on a 2nd mortgage through our divorce 6mo after finalizing in 2005. I went to get my 1st mortgage in 2016 and found out she never took it out of my name and purposely let it default because of winning custody of my son. BOA was mailing her trying to contact me instead of finding me to tell me I even owed it! I thought it was over 12yrs ago. So BOA tells me to take her to court and get a judgement stating I am not at fault, so I did (more $$ out of my pocket) and I won the judgement and they still won't honor it. I CANNOT get a mortgage because they failed in every way possible and will NOT make it right. Credit bureaus will do nothing because of BOA. I have been fighting for a 1-1\/2 yrs and I just want a home for my son & I. Thank you for lying and ruining my opportunities when I have a 750 credit score and have broke my back working hard to get a home for nothing!","3279":"Absolutely abysmal customer service.  I received a notice in the mail that I was going to be charger for a safe deposit box that, as a preferred rewards member, has been included as a complimentary benefit for over six years. The notice gives a number to call for more information, so I called.  I spoke to a rep who had no idea what I was talking about, put ** I hold for 20 minutes to research, and then tried to tell ** I had to go into the branch to deal with it. I explained that the branch is closed today, and I've already been on the phone for 25 minutes, and I would like to speak with somebody who could resolve this today. She put ** on hold for another 10 minutes while transferring ** to her supervisor.\n\nThe supervisor was useless, and repeated the same nonsense about not being able to help.  I asked why, then, did the notice have THEIR number on it???\n\nShe said she'd transfer ** over to the preferred rewards department, and disconnected the call.  I received no call back.\n\nI am livid.  A waste of almost 45 minutes.  Thanks for nothing, BoA.  This is the last straw.  Come Monday, I will be closing out ** account of 13 years with you guys.  Absolutely AWFUL customer service.","790":"I had a large credit balance on my Visa card and was promised for over a week it would be put back in my accountWell all you do is sit on hold and get no answers other than sorry to hear thatThe hold time on each call was excessive and they still owe me over 1400.00 and nothing was resolved","3280":"Never Do Business with Bank of America, especially for the Home Loan\n\nWe have a very horrible experience with BOA home loan.  Recently we have applied for a home loan from BOA.  The first contact with the loan officer did not show up the next day based on our appointment.  We did not receive any phone call or email from the loan officer.  The branch manager referred us to a different loan officer at other location.   Our loan amount is 36% of condo purchase price.  We put 64% down payment for the condo.\n\nWe have submitted all the required documents: tax return for 2015 and 2016 tax year, detail investment portfolio from two investment bankers. last two years saving and checking accounts details, annuity contract statement, credit reports, condo purchase escrow contract information, and condo buying contract.  Our credits show we are over 800 score. At the end, they still said those documents are not enough. Furthermore they want to know our spending pattern. They even question our son's property and all our 30 years residential properties history. They asked when and why we sold the properties in the past 30 years. Also, they question us why we spent $2,000 and $3,000  the two months ago.  I think BOA has violated  our privacy law and treated us like a criminal.  Most of the  questions are nothing to do with home loan.    We thought we were well qualified for this small amount of loan.  Unfortunately, they asked so many silly questions which are not related to the loan at all. Those people handling the loan in the BOA loan department are so ridiculous and ignorant without any common sense. \n\nWe were so fed up and upset with all those BOA irrelevant questions.  Finally we just walked out the door and asked for the return of all submitted documents and delete all our investment banker's detail financial PDF files downloaded to their computer.   In addition I will cancel ** BOA credit card for good and no more future business with them.  We believe the BOA top management sitting in the eiffel tower have no idea what their people are doing.  BOA must change their business practice and should have some common sense.  For the last words, BOA should respect the right of people's privacy and no discrimination attitude.  Very Bad business practice !","3331":"Service has gone downhill I have been a customer of Bank Of America for over 20 years. In the beginning it was a very good bank but that has changed over the past few years. First they got rid of the drive through windows so you either have to go into the bank or go to the atm machine which is always being worked on. Second they used to have it where if you were having an issue you can go online and speak with a rep but that has also been taken away . I do not know why they did that because it was really convenient. I believe they have let a lot of their staff go because even now when you call you wait at least 30 min to speak to a rep. To me that is very inconvenient and that is why although i have left this account open I now do my majority of banking at a credit union. I was very sad at how they went downhill and did not want to look for a new bank but really was not given any choice in the matter . i need banking i can depend on","3332":"Very happy with Bank of America! I have had both savings and checking accounts with Bank of America for almost 20 years. I couldn't be more pleased with their customer service, online banking and user friendly mobile app.\n One of the main features I like about Bank of America is their \"Keep the Change\" way to save money. When you purchase something with your debit card, it automatically rounds up to the nearest dollar and moves that small amount of change into your linked savings account. By doing this, I've noticed my savings account grow and don't even realize I'm making deposits. The amount is so small you don't miss it (hence the name \"Keep the Change\". This is a great feature that Bank of America provides.\n Any time I've had to call for customer service, I have gotten nothing but the best US based representatives. They are helpful, knowledgeable and several times have gone above and beyond what I expect from a bank's customer service department. I'm sticking with Bank Of America, you can bank on that!","3333":"Free Mobile Deposit I have had accounts with several different banks and currently Bank of American is my primary account. I am beyond pleased with their online services. Recently, I discovered that customers can do mobile deposits without a fee! That is so convenient for people like me, who rarely go to ATMs or branches, but get random checks sometimes. I have three children ages 1, 2, and 11 so there is no convenient time for me to go to a bank and I don't want to pay a fee to deposit my own money. Another feature that has been super convenient to my life is that overdraft protection. If I overdraw my account, I have until the close of business to make sure there are funds to cover the balance before I accrue any fees. Sometimes, I get paid the same day there are ACH debits so this satisfies both the bank and the person\/institution I'm paying!","791":"Been a consistently large account and reliable customer for them since 2001. This year, I needed them to back me on a fraudulent $500 Platinum credit card charge \/ rip-off scam from a local vendor to repair my broken A\/C unit. Naturally, I immediately found someone else to finish the A\/C work and learned just how dishonest the first vendor was. When I disputed the charge, BoA took their time in reaching out to me and then made me fill out 10pages of information and asked for unreasonable documentation that was impossible to acquire due to the length of time (over a week) passed by then. They wanted a second opinion, on letterhead (not an invoice) detailing the problem and what the original vendor did wrong.A.) The problem had been repaired by then you bureaucratic morons!B.) The second vendor wanted nothing to do with a formal statement on fancy letterhead - that he didn\u2019t even have!In its place, I presented the second invoice AND a notarized affidavit based on the suggestion of the BoA rep. It took them TWO MONTHS to make a decision on the charge and ruled in favor of the vendor - based on semantics in my statement and lack of letterhead.I AM DONE! Will take ALL my accounts and go elsewhere.","3335":"Identity Theft By BOA My wife's identity was stolen and my joint checking account emptied on 11\/9\/17. Worked with Bank of America to setup a new checking account and also have \"safety measures\" in place to protect my money. Last night (11\/14\/17) my identity was stolen and Bank of America allowed another fraud savings account be setup via their call center and my \"new\" joint account was emptied of what little money I could scrap together to live on until Bank of America decides to return my stolen money! The so called \"safety measures\" in place only applied to MY WIFE so they went after my identity! You would think Bank of America would have advised these \"safety measures\" be setup for both my wife and I!!! Working with Bank of America has been a nightmare - they have allowed fraud savings accounts be set up TWICE in a matter of a few days via their call center! So our nightmare continues at the hands of Bank of America as they will NOT return our money for at least 60 days! How are we to pay bills and enjoy the holidays when BOA has ALL OF OUR MONEY? So Beware - Don't use Bank of America - they do not Protect Your Money or return your stolen money nor do they protect you from creditors and BOA harassing you for payments\/late fees.","3334":"Great App and Bank Bank of America is such a great bank. I've had many other bank accounts in my past and most of them charge me all these fees for things that are irrelevant. At other banks I ended up losing more money than I was putting in. Bank of America's app is also incredibly convenient, the mobile check deposit function is my favorite. It runs so smoothly and never gives me any issues when depositing my checks. The camera is always working well and I am never worried if I won't be able to deposit my check. The balance adjusts when the check clears so I know exactly how much is in my bank account and I don't need to worry if I have enough to clear my bills. Bank of America also has a great function when I can see the routing number and account number so it's easy to attach the account to some of my online bills whereas other accounts I have to search and search for the account number and routing number making it impossible to attach and link the bank account. This website makes everything work so effortlessly. I am even able to download my bank statements on the computer or using my phone. I really have no complaints with Bank of America's online presence, I feel as though their website is extremely user friendly. If I had a choice I would switch all my bank accounts to this bank because I've never had any problems with them.","3336":"DO NOT AFFILIATE WITH BOA! I am small business owner and have been a BOA customer for 10 years. For 80% of those years I was happy with the service, if I cashed a check it was available to me the next day. They would even cash checks without the funds being available in my account. Over this past year I have have encountered \"POLICY CHANGES\" They now hold checks up to 10 days even tho I have cashed these before from the same clients. The customer service is horrible, they either have been talking over me or repeating the same thing over and over. Take it from a long time customer, DO NOT USE THIS BANK. . . the policies change at will and they will hold your money to accrue more interest for themselves. Again, DO NOT USE THIS,BANK","3337":"I love my bank I have banked with Bank Of America for 7 years now. I really do love the bank. I had never had an issue until I recently had been charged an over draft fee on my bank account. I called and they argued with me that it was a fair fee. The woman kept refusing to refund it even though I did not feel the fee was fair. I was transferred to a manager who realized there was a computer error. She fixed my account and refunded me the fee. She also sent me out a prepaid gift card. I think that little reward made up for the poor service but I was still unhappy overall. I think the overall experience is mixed. I have positive and negative.","792":"I wish I could give BOA a negative 5. They are a terrible banking institution. After decades of being a loyal customer, I made a mistake and transferred money out of my account and then transferred it back in several hours later only to be charged $140 in fees. I never made any mistake like this in the past and they were completely unwilling to work with me. My advice....Stay away from big banking institutions. They are corrupt!!","793":"So unhappy with this card. They said if i opened it i would save 100 dollars as well as 15,000 air miles so i said ok why not. Later on get the card and they did not deduct the 100 dollars also the customer service rep I talked to so rude and nasty. Told me they were not deducting the 100 dollars because I didn't have a screenshot of the proof (why would I when spirit said it was automatically going to take the 100 off) you bet im going to close the card as soon as my payment is accepted.","3338":"Good Military Bank I signed up for this bank when I was enlisted in the Army. They set me on very fast and setup all the needed precautions in case something happened to me. I was overseas and had no charge for using the ATM and they always waived my overdraft fees if I was traveling and caused an issue with getting my money. I am very happy with them. They always went above and beyond to help me out and watch out for my account. I would get calls if my card was being used in a weird way or even a new place just to make sure it was me. I even got out of paying for some fraudulent charges because they called me and let me know that my card was being used in Nigeria by someone trying to buy stuff online. Very good bank and great staff cant say enough good things about them.","794":"I advise anyone thinking about doing business with Bank of America to look elsewhere. This is the worst company I have ever used. Due to a mistake they made, a negative report was put on my credit report, and they would not remedy the situation. I am most likely speaking to a lawyer on the situation. They are a terrible company to do business with in my opinion.","3339":"Worst Bank Ever For Fees And Low Rates On Savings! I have banked with BOA for over 20 years and watched fees go up. Now they want $12 a month for basic checking unless I keep $1,500 in it, earning nothing! Too many banks have free checking to put up with this. I have $3600 a month in rent deposits from tenants but they insist I have DIRECT DEPOSIT of $250 from an employer to avoid the monthly fee. That's discrimination against me for being self-employed. Beyond ridiculous. My monthly tenant deposits are 12x this amount! I am moving all my money from BOA. What a sham.","3340":"Great Bank Bank of America has always worked with me and made making deposits very simple for me. Even allowed me to overdraft the morning I got paid without charging me fees because I was able to send them a copy of my check before I got to the bank. My bank has stayed late to allow me to get my deposit in and even allowed me to call and make deposits over the phone from my other accounts. I really have had a great experience with this bank. In my business life I deal with lots of other banks and they always seem to cause me problems. However, my bank has always worked to make it so much easier to conduct business.","2855":"been with this bank for years at first it was a love-hate relationship but now These people are on top of their game! they have caught 4 fraudulent transactions on my account !! Kootos!!  I tend to shop o line now im looking for a safer browser and another firewall? anyway, There card fraud dept I want to Give a HUGE HIGH FIVE!! Thank you!","795":"This card is terrible. When I first got the card, it was secured and through the bank account I had with them. I put $300 down to secure the line of credit and was told that if I used it and made all of the payments on time and had a zero balance at the year mark, they would graduate it for me and turn it into an unsecured card and I'd get my deposit back. That was in 2013. I applied every year and finally at the beginning of this year, I got my graduation. I have had good credit for the last two of those years. I've never missed a payment and I haven't carried a balance on this card since right before the year mark, so 2014. Every time I've used it since, I have paid it off immediately. When they graduated me, I was approved for a $500 limit and a $39 annual fee, and this card has never had any rewards. I haven't been able to get an increase to save my life and they won't lower the interest rate or remove the fee. I called to ask and they said it was because I have serious delinquencies on my credit. I have two very old accounts in collections that are about to fall off that have not affected my ability to grow my credit score to a beautiful 700+, pick up the American Express every day blue cash card (no annual fee), Chase Sapphire with an $11,000 limit, or the ever difficult to obtain CapitalOne VentureOne card (also with no annual fee) and a $5,000 limit. Clearly I can handle my credit, but I don't know what Bank of America is doing. When I asked them to close my account, they happily said okay. This is funny because just 20 minutes prior, I requested to close my CreditOne card. I feel I have outgrown this card. They fought so hard to keep me with an annual fee refund and the possibility that I'll be able to wipe out some of the features of this card I don't like. More on that in February when I call in and request it, but, I found it a touch disheartening that the Bank of America people didn't even try to keep my business and the really kind of horrible CreditOne people did (the card is horrible, not the people). So, there is my review... take it for what it is worth. Don't be surprised if you kinda get treated like the scum of the Earth even after you've built your credit into the skies. Closing a card never felt so good.","3341":"The best bank, the second best app Bank of America has a very impressive app, in that it is perfectly functioning in every single one of it's features. Whether it be quickly updating, posting FICO credit score, or receiving and making transactions you can see them all exactly when the app claims. Many companies claim a lot and fail to uphold. So, while this may not be the best mobile banking institution (app or desktop version) as Discover has an amazing site, it is one of the bests and is very intuitive to use. I have paid off credit cards on here, managed multiple accounts well, and received good links, numbers, and suggestions for customer service in one fashion, or another.","2856":"This bank is one of my favorites cause they have the most convenient mobile banking. It has many great features including fingerprint authorization which makes life much easier. But in every other way the bank is pretty standard","3342":"Pooor customer service I loved this site when you were able to get customer service on their website. However that changed about a year ago. When you call the bank they tell you chat should be working but it never is. Their hold time to get a rep on the phone is extremely long so chat was convenient while they had it . You can put a message on facebook and someone will get back to you however it is not a quick thing so if you need a response right away that is not the avenue to take. If you try to contact them by email they usually take 3 days to respond to you and then just tell you to call to a representative. I am a creature of habit and don't like changing things or I would go look for another bank to help me with my needs","3343":"online experience with BOA Generally my on line experience with Bank of America has been very good. The on line format is very easy to use and is good for people who do not have a lot of computer experience. It is not difficult to follow and also the have on line tutorials to guide you. I also like the convenience of using multiple screens to conduct your business faster such as paying bills and transferring money from various accounts. It makes paying bills convenient and easy. I also like the fact that their on line banking is very secure and has redundant security checks. They also provide a credit rating score an report for free so you can secure loans easier. You can also apply for loans on line which is nice to have in a pinch. So basically there system is easy to use for non computer skilled people like myself, very secure and also very affordable and with no physical mail to receive from them which I like a lot because there is no clutter at home with all the mailings. I like the convenience of on line banking also and it is very timely with Bank of America. I am happy with system they provide me and my family.","2857":"Got my home with them and the lady at the bank gave me a credit card too. Everything is amazing","3344":"Bank of America isnt too shabby I have banked with Bank of America for over 10 years only because they were the closest to home. My only CON is when I make deposits, they move all the transactions around so that I end up negative and owe them fees. Reason I stuck with the back is because of the PROS:, cash back deals, user friendly website, banking app where I can deposit checks right from my phone. Unfortunately, the branch closest to me has closed, so I may end up changing banks now.","3345":"Very competitive with brick banks Bank of America is a nice place to bank. Their rates are typical of what I find at other banks. They do offer a pretty good checking selection and I've been able to link my checking and savings accounts to make saving a little easier. They have a great online banking system and app for my phone. I really like the app because I'm able to do a lot of my banking without even going to a branch. When I do have to go, the lines aren't very long at the one closest to my work and there are lots of branches so it makes it a little easier. Also, they are connected to an ATM network so I can use ATMs in all sorts of places without having a fee.","796":"This is my first and only card for past few years. since im doing all my banking with them, why go anywhere else. I was so wrong... I started off with $1000 CL, I submit a credit line increase every 6 months and I was up to $25k. When I brought my house last year, I charged all my new house expenses (washer, dryer, wood flooring, landscaping, window treatment...) on this card. With all the reward I saved up. It's perfect for a new TV. When I'm ready for TV shopping, I'd got a letter from them and stated my Visa account are being closed due to all the unusual activity with my account and they consider I'm a risk to the bank. And the very worst thing was all cash reward were gone, \"forfeited\" is the term. I call and spoke to every single soul at the customer service, supervisor, and managerment. I explain the situation to them and offer pay the entire balance at once. Unfortunately, According to them nothing they can do once account are closed, so is all the cash reward. I question them why wouldnt they contact me first or at least give me a chance to explain what's going on? All I got from them was they were sorry. I paid of the Visa card the very next statement and closed all my account with them. This is a true story and thats how BoA treat a loyal customer.","3346":"Bank of America is a great bank if you dont mind the limits on money markets I have a few accounts with Bank of America and have for many years. I have a money market, savings and a checking account. My checking account I have no complaints with, its very simple to use and the fees are non existent as long as you have a direct deposit tied to it. The savings account works well but the interest rate is so low that its almost pointless. Its basically a tenth of a percent which is unheard of nowadays. The money market has a slightly higher interest rate but there is a limit to transfers from the account, only 5 times a month and then you start incurring a fee. I believe I should be allowed to make a few more transfers but overall im ok with this limit. The app works great for bank of america and I dont have any complaints about it. The ability to deposit checks from the app is amazing and makes me feel like im in the future. Overall Bank of america is a pretty good bank with decent savings and money market accounts, just wish the interest rate was higher.","3347":"A trusted bank I've used for many years. I have had a Bank of America account since 1997. I have checking and savings and I must say I am really impressed with their online banking system.\nI am constantly \"in\" my app\/online banking website, and there are several features I find excellent. I like the \"keep the change\" feature that transfers any cents on a debit card transaction into my savings account. The pennies do add up, and honestly I don't really miss them leaving my checking account.\nAnother feature I find OUTSTANDING is the online bill pay. I am able to prepay my bills and schedule when I want the money to come out of my account. It doesn't \"pend\" prior to delivery. I made a HUGE mistake in the joint account at Wells Fargo (that I share with my husband) and prepaid some online bills....scheduling them for three days in advance. By doing this I completely bounced the account! I couldn't believe it. That never happens at BOA, I know what is going out and when the money is coming out. It was almost like WF grabbed the money and took it away! I am ready to dump WF. BOA is the way to go for sure.","3348":"Bad bank I do not like this bank and it has been a bad experience over the last few years. I got this bank because my family all used Bank of America. It turned out to be a bad idea. I opened an account and I already started getting fees right away. $6 were taken from me every single month and it was money that I needed very much. I went overseas and I was charged every time I used my debit card. The other bank I use now does not do this. Even taking money out at an ATM in Russia was a problem and I had a fee for that. The fee for my account was due to increase to $12 a month. I mean, this bank is good for someone that has a lot of money, but for people starting out, this bank is just a thief that robs you six dollars at a time and has no clue how to handle overseas transactions.","3349":"Bank Of America As the executor\/trustee I have been trying to close a trust account from my mother's estate for the past 5 months. The entire chain is so incredibly incompetent from the BOA branch manager in Palm Bay FL to the BOA Enterprise Estate Unit. I don't know how many branch visits, letters and phone calls this has taken over the past 5 months for the grand sum of $900 and it still has not been resolved.I have dealt with many financial institutions over the years and my experience with Bank of America has absolutely astonished me as to how this bank can transact any business competently.Consumers should absolutely AVOID Bank of America, there are many more options out there and all of them have to better than BOA which ranks dead last.","3350":"A wonderful banking experience I have been banking with Bank of America going on five years. Bank of American has been there for me from my first Checking Account, to a Savings Account, and now to my credit card that I recently opened with them. I have a 1.25% APR on it with a credit limit of $500 as a student. It has been wonderful so far and customer support is always available for consultation. I love it.","3351":"Watch Your Back On Their Fees I lost my job for two months back in 2009, tried to get back on track with them, they dragged it for another month and then told me I couldn't make a house payment unless paying in full. then said I could do a HAARP program, after faxing to them 95 pages five times, They kept saying they didn't receive pages. I finally had to claim bankruptcy to keep the 100K in equity I had in my house. After five years of paying them back the BK was discharged and BofA charged me $50 added to my house payment for reviewing that they had received all of the payments and applied them correctly. Of course the Rules don't allow me to refinance for two years after discharge. But the day the two years are up, I am gone and they will lose my business for life.","3352":"Excellent Bank and Website This institution is very friendly and customer friendly. It is very easy to use and has lots and lots of locations around my city. I am a recent enrollee and it was very easy for me to enroll and switch to this bank. Staff at my favorite branch by my school are very friendly and professional. The person I was oriented with explained everything to me and clearly knew what he was talking about, even though he was somewhat similar to me in that he is only a few years out of college. The institution's website and iPhone app are also very straightforward and easy to use. The only thing about those is that I can't always tell what transactions have cleared and which are still pending; this is often confusing for me, in app and online.","3353":"Business with Bank of America I've been banking with Bank of America since I was around 17 years old. At this time they offered a student checking along with a student savings. To preface this, I chose Bank of America because this is where my parents were banking. Upon getting my first job, I opened up the student checking and savings. I learned that for these accounts, there were no monthly charges attached. One didn't have to keep a minimum balance in the account, nor did one have to have direct deposit in order to bypass this. Instead it was pretty simple. Fast forward a few months and a few dollars saved, I wanted to take money from my savings, and transfer to my checking. I learned that there was a certain amount of transfers between my accounts per month, or I'd be charged. At this time it wasn't an issue, as it was supposed to be a one time thing. After a few more months, I wasn't making as much, and was needing to transfer money from my accounts. I quickly surpassed my allowed amount, and began to incur monthly charges. I wasn't very fond of this, and eventually moved myself over to TD Bank. Because this isn't about TD Bank, I'll skip the jargon, and simply state that I wasn't happy with them, and moved back to Bank of America. This time I was not a student, and had to open regular type accounts. At first I didn't open a savings, because I knew the limits behind that. After a while, and seeing that I could successfully save, I opened a savings account, and since, have not had any issues with my banking experience.","3354":"A great online bank The fees are cheap and it being bank of America I knew before I signed up that it was a reputable bank. I rather enjoy this bank and it's online services are so convient. When I had an issue or a dispute customer service was quick and efficient.","3355":"Customer Service Quality I have recently explored doing business with other institutions since BOA doesn't offer land or construction loans. In this process, I have been lucky (seriously) to find 2 other quality lenders. Also, during this search process, I have come to realize how good BOA really is when it comes to customer service. I have been a customer for over 35 years, beginning with a local small town bank and several merges to end up with BOA being my bank about 20 years ago. I owe them this review because they really have been exceptional at almost everything I have done with them. Their online and mobile applications are excellent and the ability to talk to a real person is never hard to accomplish. Thanks BOA and please keep up this level of customer service at the top of your priority list always.","3356":"Bank of America online banking I must admit, I really did not want an account with Bank of America, but at this point there isn't too much of a choice. I give this bank an overall rating of average at best. Setting up the account was tedious, but I guess they are all the same in that way. My goal is to avoid seeing anyone in a bank and I think that is their goal too. Unfortunately, If you have a problem setting up your account you are left to the internet to figure it out because finding a human is next to impossible. So, customer service is pretty much non existant. Their platform is easy enough to use on your mobile phone or computer, I thought it was good and useful. They have all the necessary personal banking products that one would need. The fees bothered me, there are all sorts of penalties if you do not do things correctly, so be careful with fees and make sure you read the fine print in the contract, because they will find a way to hit you with a charge on any misstep, like an overdraw, wire fees etc.","797":"Bank of america currently let colorado bell rob me they double charged me for a room bank of America favored with me an closed my claim 3 months later they let colorado bell take my money an over draw me $106 an i closed my card so that couldnt happen how three months later your gonna allow them to do that. My bank should of stayed an my favor an let me have an existing balance with colorado bell wells fargo does that for their customers i will be dropping this bank asap an never will i bank with you guys again these guys are crooks please find a better bank thank you Felicia","3357":"Online Banking I enjoy using online banking with Bank of America because they are a well-known and trusted bank. They have been for years. They are the first bank I have ever used and I have minimal complaints. Their customer service is outstanding. Whenever I have an issue, they are able to solve it in a timely manner. Their online banking option and the application option are excellent and very user friendly. It is easy to navigate and achieve what you are trying to achieve. Bank of America is the best and there is no competition. Their fees for overdraft and cashiers checks are a little high compared to other banks, but overall they are a great bank.","798":"This is a lousy card. Calling customer service is useless because you will get re-routed several times before you find anyone who has any answers. And getting someone on the phone who speaks legibly is a challenge.The fees are high, the card takes a month to arrive, and the initial deposit is high. Go with a card from Capital One if possible. BOA's cards are a sick joke!","3358":"New bank We had been with a credit union for over ten years when my wife went out on leave with our second child. I stay at home with the kids so she is the money maker. Well the maternity check took an extra three weeks to get to us so our back became over drawn and they closed us. EDD sends the checks through bank of America and when we went in to cash them we told them about what was going on and they helped us open a new account. They were very friendly and understanding about the whole thing unlike our other bank. So now we have a checking and savings accounts and love the app we now have on our phones.","799":"Poor Customer Service! Rude, Sarcastic and Unhelpful customer service associates...and that's after waiting 35 minutes to speak with someone. They clearly don't mind losing valuable customers. BIG mistake switching to BofA. Rating= -5","1320":"actually the boa charge 25 $ monthly maintenance fee !!!!!!! pls don't be stupid and pay for their million dollars bonuses just move to a different bank show them who is stupid be smart educate yourself look at people's complaints online omg","1321":"You placed a hold on our Credit Card for God knows what and without warning. Why are you not giving us our Rewards for your mistake?This is fraud plain and simple as I had to charge $437.64 on my other card which was also embarrassing to me. Your error and I get punished. I guess we know what card not to use.","1322":"This is the only card that continues to charge fees and very hard to reverse fee. Also, I got this card based on 2 free one way flights when I traveled with them. The crew was pushing. I never got the free flights on my accounts!!!!","2858":"I had a Visa card with them. I started getting calls constantly questioning charges. One was a recurring charge for an on line music service. I kept telling them it was OK, then next month they'd call about it again. Every time I used it to charge  purchase made on line from another country they'd be all over me.  I was planning a trip overseas and they wanted to issue me a special card with a phony # to use outside the USA. I was supposed to call them right after each purchase and tell them I'd made it and it could then be processed! The most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. It was clear they wanted me to get lost. I switched to Capital One and have been very happy.","3359":"President Of Corporation I received a letter dated June 15, 2017 yesterday (June 19) stating that BOA was shutting down my business banking account in 30 days (with restrictions to the account starting in 21 days). The letter states that there is no recourse, and that no reason for this closure will be given. The folks at the local branch I've dealt with were unable to shed any light on the reasons for this. I've never, ever had any financial problems with my account, which is tied to my 22 year old business with a stellar financial history. The letter states that I can call in to an automated phone line and leave a message, but that BOA won't reconsider closing my account.","3360":"Bank of Excellence I bank with Bank of America. When I go online to check my balance, it's always very easy to get on and view it. They, also, will send you monthly statements letting you know how much money is in every account you have. The only complaint I have about this bank is that it's monthly fees are kind of high. They take out a monthly fee for every account that you have. Other than that, I've had a great experience with them. If I have any questions or concerns, the customer service team is prompt and attends to the problem right away. I remember one time I had fraudulent activity on my debit card and they cancelled it and notified me right away. The money was also returned to me. Amazing! I have banked with this bank for 8 years now and I can't say enough good about them!","1323":"The Spirit mileage program is unfortunately next to worthless. There are so many costs and limitations that I've found it's no better than simply booking a flight the usual way. In other words, once all of the extra costs are factored in when booking a flight using Spirit miles it costs about the same as paying for a flight on another airlines.","1324":":I applied for Alaska Signature credit card and they sent me platinum plus card which doesn't have any of the benefits with signature card. I had to close my account on the same day. This will still be recorded as opened and then closed account in my credit report. This experience has been frustrating and customer service is of no use. I have been a customer of so many banks, first ever experience with Bank of America which turned out be the worst experience of my life.","1325":"After having a problem with this card and receiving late fees as minimum pay amounts we (incorrect) . Payed off entire amount and got hit with an auto charge which was OK but bill did not arrive until bill is now late. Will pay off entire amount again can't deal with late fees that are not our fault. And again won't use. Charge was for AAA auto membership now plus late fees.Kinda ironic. Probably need to to cancel that as well as card.","2859":"Great banking experience.will do lot of business with  the bank","1326":"To begin with, I have a few credit cards in my name I immediately got approved for each time I applied. I have never been declined for a credit card or in a stage that needs review to process my credit app.With Spirit Airlines credit card application though, I received a message stating it would take 25 - 35 days to process. This was a huge red flag for me. I decided to call Bank of America which is in charge of Spirit credit cards and ask them to cancel my credit app because I didn't get immediately approved like I expected. I was told that it got \"declined\" two days after I applied, but I received a message stating it would take way longer. What doesn't make sense to me was I changed my employment status from all other previous times but I have a 15k increase in income and no new acquired debt. I also didn't receive a phone call to verify any of my submitted information or was asked to provide additional information via phone or e-mail. I strongly suggest anyone looking to get this credit card to NOT apply and waste 1 hard inquiry for it.","3361":"Never had an issue with BOA I've held my checking and savings account for about 5 years now. Initially, I opened the checking at the bank and the savings online, both of which were extremely simple. In the past I have tried other major institutions, all of which have flaws. Bank of America has given me great customer service, fraud protection at its finest, and great app integration. My only complaint is that in 2016 BOA redesigned their app entirely, though functionality was greatly improved, it was tedious to learn again. Despite this, I am very pleased with my bank, they have had my back on many occasions. A couple years back I was grocery shopping, when I went to check out my card was declined, I was shocked because I had just checked my balance before leaving. I paid with a different card and when I finally sat down I opened my app and saw someone was spending thousands. My balance was hundreds of dollars negative. Bank of America noticed that this is not usual for me and subsequently gave me a call. However, I missed this call and prompted the fraud detection in app. It allowed me to submit every fraudulent transaction and receive my money back quickly. I called the bank back after doing this to find out more information because the scariest part was that I had my card in my hand, it was not stolen from me and I did not lose it. So I asked the woman about the transactions and she told me they were local to me. Scary stuff. Anyway, I appreciate the attention to detail as well. Small things like travel notices, locking your card in case of emergency, ordering a new one with the touch of a button, and most of all the budgeting widget they recently released. I would recommend this bank to anyone reading this.","3362":"Be wary of Overdraft services I have had an account with Bank of America for about 2 years. I arranged to have one of my utilities deducted automatically from the account. I did not understand fully the overdraft services that Bank of America offers. Several times I have overdrawn due to my funds not being deposited actively til the next day. Every 3 days I found myself getting more into the negative as the overdraft charges occur. The customer service line was not helpful at all in this situation","3363":"Bank Of America Steals From Dead Clients It's true--Bank of America steals money from the accounts of deceased clients. It is happening to my father's account right now. He passed away some months ago, with about $7,500 in his Bank of America checking account. In January 2017, I filed all required paperwork (I am his son and the executor of the estate) to have the funds disbursed. Bank of American has never responded. On three occasions, I met with bankers at B of A offices in person. All agreed I had done everything required and the funds should have been disbursed to me long ago. They have always been polite...and they have always made it clear that they will do nothing to help me. It seems they are afraid of repercussions to their jobs and careers if they try to have the funds released. I have heard that this is a Bank of America policy. They know it is not worth the cost to me to sue them for $7,500; besides, they can tie it up in court for years (they have a staff of attorneys, so there is no cost to them). Be warned: If a loved one dies, Bank of America will probably attempt to steal the money in their account, as they are doing to me, and there is nothing you can do about it.","3364":"Good customer service and nice checking account offer I decided to get an account with Bank of America because of an advertisement offering free checking. The year was 2012. I was unable to complete the checking account application online, and the application directed me to go to one of the bank locations. Upon arriving, I was told I could indeed get the free checking account with no monthly services fees regardless of the account balance, but that it was conditional. I had to opt into e-statements, with the understanding that if I ever went into the bank to have a teller perform any type of bank service for me, there would be a charge. Since I was having a hard time finding a totally free checking account, and since I like to do many things online anyway, I decided to try it. I was also given access to a free Merrill Lynch brokerage account. I set up the account and have gone in and picked stocks to watch, but have not purchased any. I also tried out a CD account, but soon found out that the interest was so small, it wasn't worth the time. I ended the CD and had to pay a small fee that was larger than the interest earned. That was disappointing, but bad rates on accounts accruing interest were commonplace. It wasn't exactly the banks fault. Overall, I've had a good experience. Once I felt the need to do a chargeback through the bank after a merchant in Shanghai went on Chinese New year after receiving money from me for a purchase. I found out that they were going to be gone for over a month and wouldn't even speak to customers who made orders right before they left. They just left messages. Bank of America reversed the charge in short order. I had plenty of evidence the merchant was ignoring me, and the merchant resolved it on their end and cancelled the order over a month later when they got back, but I am glad Bank of America went ahead and credited the money back to me within 24 hours because it was a large sum. I have had no problems with their customer service.","2860":"They have gone out of their way to help me set up my accounts and I am not computer savy.  The only problems I have had is with their new construction and being able to get into the building.","2861":"My mother passed away and we took her death certificate to the local branch. She had a CD, which was payable upon death (POD) to my sister and me. After 30 days, we asked about the funds from the CD. Bank of America had no record of the Death Certificate. Incompetent people work as this bank. After another round of providing them with the Death Certificate, they issued the funds some 30 days later. We are still waiting on an apology.","1327":"I like using their checking and saving account, it is very easy to use. However when it comes to automobile loan, it becomes hard to make an recurred automatic payment. If they improve this feature, it would be much better.","3365":"How I used Bank of America Bank of America is a nice bank to use for everyday banking. I first began using them when I was layed off and my worker's compensation was automatically deposited into a BoA account. I liked them so much that I began to use them for all my banking. They have decent interest rates. There are several branches close to where I live and work, so they are convenient for me. I have had no problems with the people working there. All of them seem nice and helpful. Their website is good enough. Overall, I would recommend them.","1328":"This is a fantastic card to get free flights for 2,500 mile during off-peak times if you live in a Spirit hub. This works out to $0.035 per mile! Join the $9 fare club and you can check up to a 40 lb. bag for $21 on top of your free flight +$5.60 booking fee. I've been flying Spirit for over 20 years now and fly two to five times a year to Myrtle Beach, Las Vegas, and Florida from Detroit. The miles add up quickly at 2 miles per $ spent plus you get 5,000 miles when you charge an average of $834 a month or $10K per year. It's best if you can plan a trip 6 months out if not it's only $15 charge if you book 21 days in advance.","3366":"Great for online banking and banking on the go! I frequently use Bank of America for banking for my business. Bank of America has been great since we switched over from \"Meta Bank.\" The transaction fees are much, much smaller. The online banking system is great and makes life easy on the go. The online sign up is very secure, requiring a password, and often additional security questions. After logging on through a secure system I can easily check my balance, transfer funds, and view statements online without any hassle at all. Bank of America has is a very reputable bank who has high standards for security, yet is very simple and user friendly. Their customer service has been sub-par over the years and the customer service people are not the friendliest. However, if your self reliant and like to check up on your balance and need online control, this is a great bank to use.","3367":"Bank Of America Going Down Hill As a small business man B of A really stinks. Not only did they close the branch where I work, they closed almost every branch in Northern California. When I returned home after a couple months leave, they closed half my bank in Chico and got rid of almost all the senior clerks and managers. They turned my business line of credit into a damn credit card. They sold off my mortgage like I was a piece of meat. I can't wait to take my 33 year old business else where","2862":"Almost 30 years ago I went with Maryland National Bank and, lazily, stayed with the bank as it was sold and assumed a new name.  Since I travel quite a bit, BoA was handy for me.  However, I hate to think how much money I have lost by banking at BoA....They must be the most predatory bank in the country, charging for anything they can find to charge.  They take 3 days to include a wired deposit and use the time to toss \"over-draft\" charges in the account; they have lost deposits I have made (fortunately I always keep the deposit slip); they are very difficult about connecting with Quicken...so many irritating things.  I guess that is why the personnel are extra friendly...Do not bank with this bank.  I am now with PNC and have found a totally different attitude....PNC has bent over backwards to be helpful.","1329":"Very poor service.. I have Business account with BOFA and I have western union agent location. Because of my western union money service business, the Bofa is freezing my account at least once a year although i am providing all required documents. The customer service in Bofa's MSB service unit is literally pathetic. The customer representatives have no sense how to talk and handle issue. Every time i called customer service they are giving different answer to the same question and says your documents submitted is not correct. After every correction, they are asking new correction and this cylcle never ends. It gives so much pain and frustration.. Better to open account with any other bank.","2250":"You may be able to earn points but when you try to redeem it for \"eligible purchases\", be prepared for the transaction NOT to work. Apparently, it depends on how the MERCHANT codes it. I attempted to use my rewards for amusement park tickets, and because the merchant coded it as \"gift Shop\", Bof A did not allow me to use my points. Even after I offered to show them my receipt to show it was a legitimate claim. I even spoke to a manager who basically told me that it did not matter what I thought, it was their policy and the only reason I was unhappy was because it was not to my benefit.So accrue all the points you like. You may not be able to redeem them in a way that this card promises.","2863":"Managers at BofA tend to step over employees and act innocent when it comes to confronting HR. 10xx happier at my new job!!","3368":"Money Held Hostage I sent in a claim form I was told to only send by mail. After doing so, about 2 months later i get an email telling me my claim will be reversed because they didn't receive the paper. I had to call, get another form sent which was gonna take 3-5 days to reach me. Then was told the next day after calling back for a faster solution, to go to a bank. I sat at the bank for almost an hour dealing with this. Sent the form in, called back in 2 days like i was told. They told me they were a 3rd party company that had nothing to do with BofA accounts. I waited another week before calling again for my money. Just to be told something might happen in another 3-5 business days. Then when I'd ask a question, they'd read the same standard answer to me over and over not actually answering my questions. On the verge of suing for this small ass amount.","3369":"Paying Bills the easy way. Bill pay is helpful because I can setup all of my bills to be paid either early or on the day they are due I know others offer this, but Bank of America even helped me with a dispute I had. One of my bills was saying they didn't receive my payment and thanks to Bank of America I was able to show them exactly how and when they were paid. The customer service person didn't act annoyed that they had to go out of their normal routine to help me either. So many companies will do only what they feel like they absolutely have to do for customers. Sometimes you just feel like a number and a bank balance. But not to Bank of America, I felt important.","3370":"Poor, Oops, No Customer Service No customer service. No customer service. No customer service. No customer service. No customer service. No customer service.If your time worth more than a cent per hour, do not use this bank!!!!!!","3371":"Overall good. I like Bank of America's service in overall. They have a relatively fast act on any problems related to fraud and hacking. For instance, I called their customer service after finding out that I lost $500.00 out of blue from my checking account. Their personnel responded me by asking a series of question to identify myself related to my personal information. Then, they figured that the their ATM machine in my town got manipulated by someone who put a card reader on top of the their ATM card reader so that they could scan my card information and was able to create a copy of my debit card. They immediately refunded $500 to my account back and started an investigation on this incident. I was surprised how quick they acted on this type of incident and was happy to be a part of them.","2864":"Called the customer service line to figure out why my credit card account is closed. They transferred me 5 times just to get to the right department. Each rep asked for the same info so I was getting tired of repeating myself. When I finally get to the right department (Secured Credit), I was able to find out why my account was closed.This whole process cut into my entire lunch period just because I needed to \"Get to the right department\" Stupid, and pointless.","2865":"BofA is an atrocious bank. One would have thought after the crisis that they would be in a stronger position and learned their lessons, but clearly only seek to maximize profit. The website has poor UX and limited functionality. One is basically a HOSTAGE- if you want to open or close accounts etc you have to make an appointment at a branch. Everything online is complicated or limited so there is no point using their web portal. All this for a hefty fee! Where are the regulators - why havent they done like in Europe and made this more consumer friendly? IF they arent letting users handle their own accounts like adults then what value are they providing? I for one am done and have been seeking to close my account but dont have time to set up an in-person meeting!!!","2251":"It's a good starter bank. Make sure you read the TOS especially if you are a student (you might have to maintain a minimum balance etc). Other than that, it's good bank to start off your credit history with.","3372":"Bank of American Mobile Banking The thing I like about banking with Bank of America is that they have a mobile app available. But this isn't just some crummy app that you don't really use. Instead, I use it for pretty much everything, even making deposits. The app is incredibly easy to navigate which is great because I wouldn't use the app if it weren't. But my favorite thing about it is that I get to deposit my paychecks from pretty much anywhere. I get paper checks from my job, and going to the bank to deposit funds twice a month can be a bit tedious. After all, I don't think anyone enjoys waiting in line at the bank. So when I get a check, I simply log into the app, take a quick photo of each side of the check and choose which account to put it in. The funds are technically added the same business day, though you cannot access them for debit card transactions until the following day. This is especially nice because I have learned that when taking a check into the bank for deposit it takes an extra day for the funds to be added which can be really frustrating. Oh! and did I mention that you can choose to use your fingerprint to login to the account so you don't have to worry about remembering the password? I have at least 50 passwords for various sites so being able to login with the fingerprint is really awesome because it's so easy. I also noticed that earlier this week the app has made it to where you don't have to even login to view your balance. You simply open the app and hit balance. Obviously if you want more information you are going to have to login, but it's nice to be able to access balance information so quickly and easily. I only have a couple small issues with this bank. For one I don't like that every method of depositing money seems to take a different amount of time to post. You depost through the app it posts the same day but isn't available for purchases till the next. You deposit at the atm $300 is available immediately. You deposit with a person at the counter your funds won't post until the following day and won't be available to make purchases until the second day. This can be extremely confusing and it took me at least 6 months before I figured out the various rules. I mean it is my money, so it can get frustrating when you have to wait a day or even two to be able to access that money. My other issue with banking at Bank of America is that the customer service is kind of hit and miss. It seems to be based on who you happen upon. Some customer service reps are great others are awful. In fact when I have had issues with my account I have been known to get one bad customer service rep, hang up and call back, and then get a great customer service rep who is more than happy to help me out. Though even this can be frustrating because once you hang up it take a while of suffering through the automated phone line before you can reach another rep. I will say though, I have had dealing with 3 separate banks and Bank of America is the absolute best.","3373":"Convenience and Customer service are key. I have banked with Bank of America for many, many years now. It seems these days I don't go into the bank as much as I used to, due to to convenience of mobile banking; however, on the occasion I do go in I am always given quick and friendly service. The real reason I have stayed with Bank of America so long is the online and mobile platforms are easy to use and dependable. I have set up auto billpay for all of our bills and have never had any issues. Everything is pretty much one or two clicks away on the mobile app and I appreciate the ease of use with my busy lifestyle.","3375":"My Bank of America Experience My review of Bank of America is positive.I would recommend this bank to anyone. First off,banking is simple.If you go inside the branch, sometimes you will see a long line at first,because it is a popular bank. However, the tellers are very fast and friendly,and lines move very fast.The inside lobby is very comfortable with complimentary snacks coffee and such. The mobile banking is easy to follow and understand, not jumbled and confusing. Overall, I like the customer service. I had a situation one time were I had some transactions come through that I forgot about.I was overdrawn around $75 with fees. I call the bank and explained and they took care of it for me.","3374":"My BOA I have done business with them for the past 18 years. The majority of the interactions with them have been quite pleasant. I could probably count the number of negative experiences with them on one hand. I started off with just a savings account, and as time went on that grew into an additional savings account, checking account and mortgage. Over time, I have grown accustomed to using their mobile banking and website to do most of my banking. It is reliable and easy to use, rather than drive to the physical bank location.","3376":"Bank of America - Accounts review I have been using Bank of America for over ten years now. I have their savings, checking, and credit card accounts. As for the accounts themselves, as long as you do not overdraft, there are little to no fees associated. Transactions are recorded promptly and can be made easy at ATMs, online, or in person at the bank. Interest earned on savings tends to be low. As in all banks, the major drawback in my opinion is having to deal with automated phone services if there is an issue. Eventually you can talk to an assistant, but it takes some tactful maneuvering to do so. In the case an overdraft does occur, you can sometimes explain the reasoning to a bank worker and they will credit you for it. Also, their fraud protection works well if charges are put on your account from a stolen card. Overall, I would recommend the bank, as it is secure and convenient. Just be responsible in your decisions.","3377":"Bank a 'Merica (Go Freedom!) I joined Bank of America in 2015. My old bank, Union Bank of California, closed its branch in my town, and the only other option was BOA. I hadn't heard good things about them. Friends reported that they (BOA) were impersonal, over-corporate, and indifferent in their customer service. Most of that has turned out to be untrue. In fact, their customer service has been unusually friendly, considering how awful customer service can be. I had an issue with mobile banking, for example. The woman I spoke to at the BOA service center (phone service) walked me through the problem patiently, even when I didn't have the right language to explain the problem. She explained that a default setting in my account was causing the app feature to not work (it was more complicated than that, but you get the idea), and was able to correct the snafu lickity-split. Then she asked if I was having a nice day and whether I thought the Broncos were going to win the Super Bowl (it was around Super Bowl time). I'm not a big fan of BOA's online banking system. It's fairly bland, and banking options are sometimes difficult to locate in the drop-down menus. I'm also not too keen on how long it takes transfers, especially international transfers, to clear. But I figure you'll get these hitches with any bank you run with, so I don't lose sleep. For a supposedly evil institution, I've been relatively pleased with the service I've received.","2253":"If you have had any problems with Bank of America do not apply for this card! I have great credit and was denied in store after filling out the application. Will not know why until they send me a letter. But it is already on my credit report. They just lost a long time customerWhat a waste of my time.","2252":"I'm very disappointed with the BOA Secured Credit Card. I've had my card almost 2 years and hv tired to get the security deposit released and they never release it. All payments hv been made on time, nothing late on any credit cards opened. Rebuilding credit , however if you can never hv your card unsecured or increased you credit really isn't improving and they are sitting with my deposit. Was told after a full year of onetime payments they would increase and the definitely hadn't been the case. Deceiving Card, don't bother!","3378":"Reliable, Easy Banking I have used Bank of America for the better part of a decade now, and they have been reliable no matter where I reside. I originally opened an account when I was living in Houston, TX. Branches were readily available if I had any troubles or lost a debit card. I now live in the lakes region of New Hampshire, and I am least 30 miles from the closest ATM or physical location. I still find it easy to do anything that I need. The online banking is wonderful and I can make any necessary transactions within a browser, or their wonderful app, despite me being so far from a branch location. I can deposit checks, transfer money between accounts, and even order a debit card without having to leave my home. I've even had my debit card stolen twice and had fraudulent charges reimbursed to my account without much hassle or a long wait. I definitely recommend Bank of America for any of your banking needs.","3379":"Secured Internet services I have been the customer with bank of america for the past 7 Years. They have gradually modified the user interface and now it's the best of them. And the best thing to admire is their security of internet banking services.  Below are the security features that i would best of them\n1)2 layers of support including verifying the pictures to login 2)SECURE PASS CODE while making the transaction.\n3)Verifying Our Debit or Credit Card while adding new user.\n And\nThe App support has become good and easier to make the transaction. The new look with balance details are crisp. Messaging services are\n add on support to the website and they do respond immediately to resolve my concern.\n Regarding Transaction, They have introduced multiple ways to send the cash to customers including Email, Mobile and Account number. I would recommend my friends to open the account on BOFA because of internet security and services.","3380":"Lots of unneeded fees and mediocre customer service I have had both a checking and savings account with Bank of America a few years ago. At the time, the customer service was terrible. It look a long time to get through to an actual representative. I remember that I would actually have to hang up and call back a few times. This was due to the automated system being extremely difficult to get through and actually speak to a live person. They also had unreasonable fees. I was charged a $10 fee just to have a checking account. I never received free checks to start out with (like my current bank does) and I would receive overdraft fees all the time. I would receive these fees even when I brought my account to a positive balance the same business day. Of course, customer service would never help in these situations. The only decent thing that I can mention about this bank is their online service. The online website was extremely user friendly and easy to use. However, overall, my experience was terrible.","2254":"Is there a no annual fee Alaska card? I have a friend who insists there is no annual fee on her card.","2866":"Great help all the time on phone and web. site really helped with lendup loan and credit karma two companies that are not caring and no personal help (see my review on lendup and credit krama. Ella Mcgow","3381":"Worst Banking Experience Ever I recently was contacted by Bank of America stating they were closing all of my accounts checking and credit cards. One of the cards have an annual fee which of $59 which was paid a month earlier. I requested a refund or pro rated refund of the fee. They rep on the phone said they would but it never happened. I had cash rewards of over $150 on my account and they said once they close the account they keep your rewards money. The reason they said they were closing my account was because of my credit score which was just over 700. This is one bank not to be trusted.","3382":"Poor Customer Service Never fail to under exceed my low expectations.Made a 10 AM appointment with the bank branch. Received notices as requested. Got there at 9:55 and was told to have a seat. 10:20 was told they are running late and would be with me shortly. 10:30 I left.","2255":"I have had problems with trying with a a simple checking account from multiple banks. Im struggle to get a decent credit score and ive had a account with ur bank before but my account was hacked and never got fixed, but id love to be back with your bank and be able to direct deposit my checks to your bank","3383":"Online Banking Their online banking has matured over the years and I think it is good. I have a few tweaks I would make, but otherwise very few complaints.","3384":"Ideal Service Every visit to Bank of America starts off with a Specialist greeting. At times I am ushered into the bank with a smile and a welcome. As I fill out my account slip, I do appreciate personnel querying me about any deposits they can make on my behalf so I do not have to wait in line. This bank is the only one I have even received a bottle of water and snacks on a few of my visits. In my recent visit, I loved the novel concept of showing how much the dollar is worth on their flat screen. The bank teller helped me determine how to make my bank needs quickly. I leave this day glad I had visited BOA. I had everything squared away and in a timely manner. Thanks.","3385":"Average Banking Experience So I've been with BofA for over 10 years. The main reason being convenience. It's nice that they are all over the country, as I have moved a lot in my life. However, I've seen over the years that fees have gone up for everything. It's annoying that they charge a $35 overdraft fee and are usually unwilling to refund more than one or two a year. They charge fees for not keeping a minimum balance in your account and that has been frustrating. I will say that the online and mobile app are really good and rarely have problems. I'll probably keep using BofA because I'm too lazy to switch, but I would say that it's just an average, money making banking institution.","2256":"I signed up for this offer due to the $100 signup promotion. The account is basically a personal checking account, nothing special. However, I was surprised at how separated and poor the customer service was from the rest of BOA. Much of my communication was manual and slow (including account application and signup), Worst of all, the did *NOT* ever pay the $100 offer. I had to call in twice, spending almost 3 hours on the phone. The first time they agreed to pay but said it would take a month. The second time they would not pay and said they had no record of my first call. Never had a problem with a bank before now, but this is by far the most frustrating account I have ever had.","2867":"They are all bad, the big banks, but BofA is unhelpful, arbitrary and uncaring, from their branches to their helplines. Cut the dependency and use a local bank!","3386":"Monthly Charges are a big issue I had been banking with Bank of America for most of my life.\n For the most part, this has been a positive experience. I would often deposit cheques and money into the account. It would be cleared the same day in 95% of the instances.\n The staff was friendly and courteous. The mobile app was easy to use, and I could access my online banking information.\n Many times I returned from vacation with money left over. I could easily exchange money back into dollars.\n That concludes the positive aspects of the experience.\n The negative aspects began when I received a letter in the mail. It highlighted a change in the banking charges.  The main change was as follows:\n Currently, I had no month fee's, and I would deposit money periodically. The new rules stated that I would be charged a minimum fee if I did not meet certain criteria. The main criteria outlined in the letter was X amount of deposits per month.\n Within the next three months of using the account, I did not meet the minimum deposit amount.\n Resulting in a charge for a change in a rule.  I was not happy and moved the account to a local credit union. No charges present at the local bank.","3387":"Bank of America is My Choice I frequently use Bank of America online and I can honestly say that I am totally satisfied with them overall. The bank recently contacted me to let me know that my bank card may have been compromised and instantly informed me of the situation. They even sent me out a brand new bank card without any hesitation. Also, they have it set up so you can get messages via mobile text or email. You have the choice of how frequent you get these updates and what type of updates you receive. I would definitely recommend this bank to all my family and friends. They truly do show a lot of interest in what the customers want and need.","2257":"Bank of America has been terrible. I had a student account with them and they said it would last while I was in college, except they forgot they didn't tell me that they would start charging maintenance fees after I turned 23. Real classy guys. I am barely making enough money to afford rent and you are sucking off me like a leech. Closed my bank account there and am never taking my business there again. I am also trying to spread the word through as many online reviews as possible about how slimy this Bank is, preying on people's hard earned money. DO NOT\u00a0use this Bank!","2258":"There is sooo much wrong with this card.1. Preferred Boarding is Zone 2, Zone 1 is saved for those who PAY for luggage2. I have 25,000 that will get me ONE one-way flight. Can't find a single flight this year for where i need to go and when. It is cheaper to buy a ticket than use the miles. Even trying to book when their chart says 2,500 Off-peak is a lie. There is nothing this year 2016 that lets me go to Los Angeles, Tampa, Orlando, Denver, DC, etc...for less than 25k miles :(. Ridiculous","2259":"this card is very good for building credit.I had this card for about 5 years now and so far so good.I have manager to get myself out of debt because this card allow you to take credit lines that you can afford to pay back.My mother and sister has been using this card for a while now and they both was able to get a car of the credit line they both have build.I i'm looking to do the same in the near future also with bank of america.I will say that this card is great and the customer service was very helpful when needed.I give this card 2 thumbs up..","1760":"They lost my Spirit Air account to where my miles are going and I'm not getting help from either Spirit Air or BoA. :( Not very happy at all at the moment.","1761":"I looked into this card before I applied to see if it would be beneficial and it has been for me based on where I am flying from and to. I fly 1-2 times a month from FLL to BWI and most of my flights when purchased off peak with this card have only cost me 5,000 miles round-trip plus $26. That is amazing. I even already have a Dec flight booked that was the same amount of points and was only $11.20!!!! You do have to be somewhat flexible with dates as well. Spirit has all the resources available online for you to research BEFORE deciding to get this card. Bottom line is- do your homework and don't complain when it's not what you expected.","1762":"Very bad customer support. They make it difficult to have your points credit in your account.","1763":"The worst credit card in the world. Stay on the phone for 4 hours trying to get something accomplished !!!!","1764":"Caveat: I do not work for Spirit Airlines and agree that their customer service at times is not the best. Nevertheless...If Spirit actually flies to your desired destinations, then you just need to understand how to utilize the rules to your benefit.First of all, if you are husband and wife (or any travel pair), you can get 35K bonus miles (which is 15K for person #1, 15K for person #2 and 5K for person #1 referring person #2).Detroit - Cancun roundtrip offpeak is 5,000 miles per person whereas a typical ticket is $300 - $400 per person. Do the math and decide when to pay in miles and when to pay in cash.Secondly, your miles have the most value when you use them off-peak. Look at the off-peak schedule and travel only during that time (if possible).You can also get partial savings. We booked a one-way to Punta Cana on a particular day using miles and a return flight on another airline using cash and the net cost is less than a roundtrip ticket using cash. Again, do the math!Thirdly, be mindful of the rules. Use your card at least once a month, if only for a $5 purchase at McDonalds.There is no downside to the card. There may be downside to Spirit Airlines in terms of customer service (sometimes) and charges for everything they deem extra - which is everything. Factor this into your travel costs and decide if another airline has a better deal (either financially or \"emotionally\").","1765":"Bear in mind, you can have many points for regular purchases but can only use the Travel Rewards points on BoA if you used some of the purchaes on travel. (Eg, if you have 50,000 points, you have to have spent at least $500 dollars- on travel expenses (anything from bus and plane tickets or hotels, to cabs or to buy or refill metro \/ subway \/ public transportation fares.) If you have 50K points but only spent 100 of your card purchases on travel, you can only use 10K of your points for travel reimbursement. Also, this card only REIMBURSES travel- and that can be a pain. (See reviews by others below. Travel charges on the card, which are 'covered by points'- you end up paying interest on the charges during the delay period before BoA gets around to reimbursing you for your travel purchase. Big costly whammy there!)Also BoA I haven't tried this yet- but I have another BoA card- regular \"BoA Rewards'. My travel rewards card only REIMBURSES for travel services- and I hear there are costly problems with that. (See reviews below from others.) The regular 'Rewards' card has 'concierge travel service'- where you pay for the travel WITH your points directly.A customer service rep told me I could accumulate 1.5 points per purchase on my BoA Travel Rewards card (the 'regular' rewards card only gives 1 point per dollar charged, so that's not cost-effective) but that I could then TRANSFER the accumulated Travel Reward Card point over to the Regular Rewards card, (with no loss of points) and use my regular BoA rewards card to book travel through the BoA (regular) Rewards card Concierge Desk- and that way the points on the old card's Concierge desk- will pay for the travel costs directly with the accumulated points- no waiting and paying interest on reimbursements.It might not work- it was a suggestion from a rep, I haven't tried it yet. OR it could be that the prices are higher on the Concierge Desk than booking directly- or that might not be the case but - transferring the 1.5 points accumulation on the Travel Rewards BoA card to a regular BoA rewards card might be a solution to all the costly problems people have using the Travel Rewards points or getting them reimbursed.","3388":"Too many disadvantages We currently have a banking account with Bank of America. Often I resort to using our our banking accounts and prefer not to deal with BOA as much as possible. Bank of America is great if you need to make transfers between accounts, and for that only. However, if you need any kind of support, help, have any questions, or even need to speak with a customer care rep, this place will have you on your heels of anger. Why do I need to schedule an appointment to walk in this bank, yet not at any other banks? Finally, once you do get to talk to someone they act like they are too busy to handle your needs. Everyone seems like they have more important things to do. If you call for help via phone, they tend to ask too many questions, and refuse to help you without you giving secured information to them over a phone which could easily be open source monitored. Every location I visit, the staff is absolutely rude and over-all they act as if they just don't want my business, hence I try and stay away from here as much as possible.","3389":"Truly Pissed Now, I have an account with BOA, been waiting for my deposit since May 23, 2016. Now I've learned that BOA does not do direct deposits on weekends, ok, and Monday was a holiday, ok, so expected to get my deposit on Tuesday, no deposit. Ok what the hell is going on??. I called were the check came from they said that the check is definitely at BOA, so what the hell is going on? Talk with BOA customer service told me to wait until Wednesday between 12am-8am. What?? I have never ever had to deal with nothing like this ever never with no other bank account. I'm used to my direct deposits coming in Monday-Friday. I mean what the hell BOA.??","1766":"During the last couple months AAA Credit Card has transitioned from VISA to Master Card. I never had any problems when they were with VISA, but on my first billing I got an \"Interest Charge on Purchases\", I called member services and asked how that can be because I have auto-payment where my bill is paid in full every month. She said it was an error in the system and happened because it was the first billing system with the new \"Master Card\" charge card. She said it would be reversed, BUT if it happened to me, then I suspect it happened to many others. Not everyone scrutinizes their charges and there will be many that just pay the charge and not take the trouble of rectifying it.This should have been a safeguard in the system, and if this can happen with something like this, it makes me wonder, just how well they are watching out for us (their customers).","3390":"Efficent, Speedy, and Very Friendly My experience with Bank of America has always been very professional and considerably enjoyable. I always feel like my transactions are safe and treated with the respect they deserve. The customer service I have experienced has always been polite and courteous. They have been willing to go above and beyond on multiple occasions. For example, I once made a cash deposit into the wrong account. It was my error but I was able to resolve the issue online in a manner of minutes. The service is truly exceptional. I never am left waiting during online or brick and mortar visits. Overall, I highly recommend this bank. I expect only the best when dealing with my financial security, that is why I choose and stay with Bank of America. The speed of service, friendliness, and professionalism simply cannot be matched. I would know, I've tried them all out!","1767":"Worse credit card ever. I have had good experiences with Frontier and United credit cards (got a free round trip with both of them). I could never used my miles with Spirit because they make it impossible for you to get a ticket. Then I tried to use my 20.000 miles to get magazine subscriptions (not that I wanted really) and they canceled all my miles and said I needed to get 200 miles in the next two months to be able to get the miles back. Worse customer service and worse airline too, I won't recommend anybody to get involved with Spirit.","1768":"I've had this card for about four and a half years now.they have pretty good service no matter what the problem is and they provide great help. I was so happy when I first started using the service, because they are not impersonal like other bank credit card companies that I have had to deal with.I will highly recommend this card because it really help me build credit and was great for loans and good service...great bank great choices two thumbs up.....","1769":"Its true, this is the worst card.

I would have liked to do this on the website, but that wasn't available. I called and explained the situation. The person helping me looked into different scenarios to link the account to avoid charges. In the end I was given a refund of the last months charge and the account was closed. I was very happy for the effort and satisfied with the outcome.","3392":"Class Action Lawsuit? READ ENTIRE POST\/Reply Opened acct w\/BOA about 2 yrs ago. Was told with DD NO FEES!

When I am down to almost nothing in my account, I use cash until my DD is deposited (like 3 days) I ONLY NOTICE when my acct is that low, the transactions seem to be \"held\" to cause a negative in my account\" SO during that call, the service rep told me how the transactions are put through, I repeated it back to her this way \"so you are telling me that BOA puts through transactions in the \"order\" they see fit\"? She said \"YES\"!! I also had my DD go in on Fridays, same DD, Friday every other week, nothing changes! It should be there at 12:01 am Friday, OH NO - when ever they want...Well it was 730am Friday, I ran to the convenient store to get a coffee $1.07) (saw my DD was in my account) got home w\/coffee to an that I was $1.07 NEGATIVE!!! With this said, you can see they are doing EXACTLY what TD BANK had the Class Action lawsuit against them for! The 2 girls who started the lawsuit WON! If you have experienced this, PL reply back - lets get a lawsuit going and make them STOP THIS! We work too damn hard for our money for the bank to be causing us over drafts bc they make it happen!","2180":"NEVER PURCHASE THIS CARD!!! I was sold on 15,000 free miles. 100% of the time, it has been cheaper WITHOUT using the card! This card is a SCAM and this is a penny pinching airline!","2181":"The website makes it seem you can apply and use the benefits\/perks for the $9 instantly... you cannot because there is no credit card information generated. So they run your credit and then, once you get the card in the mail, then you can start using. All the pop ups trying to get you to apply are misleading.","2182":"Be aware that BOA has changed their policy regarding how travel reward points are redeemed. The new way they are actually earning interest!we have been BOA customers since 1998 and in the past these travel rewards points simply were exchanged for a ticket. The new BOA policy stipulates that the customer first pay upfront for the ticket with the same credit card that has earned them the travel rewards points. This way the customer actually pay for their trip upfront.Secondly the money is supposedly refunded the following business day as their travel reward points are redeemed. This is where the system fails and actually becomes fraudulent!Personally this is our experience: Three months later and many hours spent on the phone, we still had not been reimbursed for the ticket we paid for upfront. in addition, BOA also charged us interest for the trip and it was substantial due to the ticket cost.We had repeatedly called the supervisor at BOA travel reward department who had promised to promptly reimburse us for the ticket we bought with the thousands of travel rewards mileage we had accrued. Three months later, when nothing happened, she stopped taking our phone calls!Yesterday an employee in the business card department found our travel miles unredeemed in our account. That day only we had spent four hours on the phone being transferred back and forth between departments or just plainly hung up on!The supervisor at the travel rewards department had not even bothered to follow up on our claim. Shame on you BOA Travel Rewards Department! This has cost us money, interest and many valuable hours of our time trying to resolve this issue!","2183":"A ticket Chicago-Baltimore $34 regular... Special price for card holders $2,500 miles plus $55.60. Do I need to say more?","3393":"Contacting Bank Of America I've been trying to contact Bank of America for days now. Calling them makes me enter a whole bunch of information only to tell me no agents are available at this time. Connecting to there secure online messaging system tells again, no agents are available at this time. Sending them an email seems impossible as no email is listed anywhere. Is this really what customer service has become?","2184":"I got this card over 3 years ago because I had bad credit. I payed on time every month and kept utilization low. I was upgraded to a normal credit card after 2 years. I've been requesting for a credit limit increase but got denied every time. I signed up with Chase and got a 2k limit instantly. Too bad I can't just throw this garbage BOA card away since it's my oldest card and it will pull my credit score down. Now I'm stuck with a crap $500 limit and $39 annual fee. Also if I have any issues such as unauthorized charges, they make me wait on hold for a whooping 45 minutes before an actual person talks to me. 39 dollars a year for that kind of support, ha. I wish I went with a different card.","2185":"Most horrific banking experience. Wanted to cancel my saving account and called them zillion of times. First of all, they opened my account without telling me that there will be $12 maintenance fee\/month. After being charged for a couple of months, I called them to cancel it. Women working there are out-of-their mind. They always came up with hundreds of reasons for not being able to cancel my account (like charges suddenly appeared at the same exact time in the middle of the month when I wanted to cancel my account). Guys working there are really racists and sketchy. They are so afraid to introduce themselves by their last names. I talked to this George guy who refused to tell me his last name while he repeatedly told me that he has my last name differently on-file. Made me sound like I don't know the root of my family. Every time, I called these people, they were more concerned about asking my mailing address precisely down to the zip code (which I am pretty sure they could look it up if they have a brain or some sense of being a human) to deliver a piece of useless confirmation (which I am very sure that they could deliver by email). Overall, they are genuinely more concerned about where I live and my ethnicity rather than offering me some professional help. Overall, a group of very sketchy, racist, unprofessional people working at the bank.","2186":"I first got this card because I needed some extra cash. The cash reward is great. It does give you something for spending on their card. I would improve the rate of the cash reward though. 1% is OK but 2% or even 3% would be a lot better. I would still recommend it to other people though because 1% is still better than nothing. The customer service is also pretty good. I had to return something and go through customer service and they had no problem with it and it only took 10 minutes on the phone. A+ card!","3394":"Slow ACH Transfers (With Workaround) I have a BofA checking account that I got with Preferred Rewards that I use for local banking services. I ran some tests to see how long it would take to transfer money from my other accounts (at Ally Bank) to BofA.Initiate transfer at BofA web site: 3 daysInitiate transfer at Ally Bank web site: 2 daysInitiate transfer at Merrill Lynch web site, and then transfer to BofA: 1 dayNote also that BofA charges $3 if you initiate a transfer out of your account from their web site (!!!).Bottom line: It never makes sense to use BofA's web site to do an ACH transfer. Always use your other bank's site. The fastest way to get money to your account is to use Merrill Lynch's site to transfer from your bank to ML (1 day) and then to transfer from ML to BofA (instantaneous).","3395":"Soooo Bad Today I went to two branches to take check,but i can't becouse the branches said we don't have money .... I don't know why them open !!!!!","2187":"This card is great, until you run into issues. Each month there are special offers that you can add to your account. I added a DirecTV offer for $100 cash back, and it was never received. The first time I called, I was told that there were no issues and it would be paid within 10 days. The second time I called, they said that the person I talked to didn't know what they were talking about, and offered to send an inquiry to the cash rewards department. Two days later, I got the email confirming that I had earned the $100 cash back. Only problem was, they applied it to the end of February. So my cash rewards account said that I had been paid $113.98 at the end of February, but my debit card balance only reflected $13.98--missing the $100. This is the third time I've called, and been transferred to four separate departments half of them not knowing what I was talking about and some not even knowing that there were more deals associated with a cash rewards card. Really annoyed. Never want to have to call them again.","2188":"I am a BOA customer of over 15 years. I Iove to travel and was attracted to this offer due to no annual fees, no foreign transaction fees and the introductory rate. HOWEVER, I recently traveled out of the country and notified BOA of my travel dates to safeguard against any fraudulent charges on my account out side of that window of time. Two weeks after the date I notified the bank of my return, there were almost $2000 of fraudulent charges on my account. I still have the card in my possession! Someone must have somehow duplicated my card. BOA does not monitor this card!! They never froze the account nor notified me of the charges. When I filed the fraudulent claim, they investigated and denied the claim. They said the card and a signature was present. Well I don't know how the card was duplicated because I still have that card in my possession, but the signature would have been easy to obtain if they looked at a receipt I signed while there. Make sure you monitor your transactions carefully. Since they denied the claim despite the travel notification that I provided, I will be using another card and will be happy to pay the annual fee if they can provide security.","2189":"I applied for my own Bank of America Cash Rewards card after seeing my best friend using one, while we were on vacation. She said it took away some of the guilt of spending money. I use mine to purchase things that I normally would have to purchase anyway, but by using the card, they give me credit that I can use to pay down my card or have it deposited into my checking account. I think it's an awesome benefit. My only gripe is that they lower the cash back amount to 1% after a certain amount. Their customer service is very good. I have always have my concerns taken care of immediately. I always recommend this card to all my friends and family.","1050":"I've had this card for about 8 years to help me build credit. Had to put down a $500 deposit to secure it. It's okay, but very limited. The APR is pretty low, I can use it just about anywhere, and there's no smart chip so I don't have to worry about the type of identity theft so common with those type of cards now. On the downside, there's no rewards, and my credit limit is never getting extended on the card (which is the same as the deposit). If you're looking for a starter card to help build your credit, you could do worse than this one. Just don't expect it to change everything for your credit situation.","1051":"I have had this card for almost a year and it has been terrific. I am able to earn cash back rewards on any kinds of purchase and it is great for me to build my credit. The APR could be a little high but I have no worries as I pay my balance off every month. Very great card and simple to use.","1052":"I am using this card since 4 months now. I was very happy with the points earned around 1.5 points per $1 spent however at other cards, I am getting only 1 point per $1. I am disappointed today when I try to redeem my 22000 points thinking I will get $220 +10% more being Preferred customer of BoA. However I came to know that the total value for 22000 points in $132. Yes, $132. Which was very shocking to me. When I spoke to customer care (Tim), He told me that the value of 1.5 point is only $1 and some extra charges for cash redemption. It is same for gift cards too. They say 4200 points for $25 gift card. This is pathetic. If anyway, I am going to get less than $1 for each $100 spent then Why are you cheating customers saying you are earning more points. Till now, BoA impression was very good for me but it is lost. I would never recommend this card to anyone.","1053":"I specifically got this card for the travel aspects- the rewards can go towards flights and there is no foreign transaction fee, which is something lacking in the Chase freedom- my other main credit card. I have Capital One for debit, and that has no foreign fees, but sometimes I feel safer using credit. I like that I get 1.5x points for all purchases, but I do wish there were certain categories I could get more in. Since I have that for my Freedom though, it didn't bother me too much. I would recommend it only to people who travel, since there are better cash back cards out there, with similar bonuses. Oh! I like the 20,000 point bonus for spending $1000 in the first 3 months. That's easy to get to! And no annual fee, which makes me very happy.","1054":"This is a great card for students since it was what I got when I went the college. If this card is not approved, there is a student version of the card. Overall the card has a simple, no-hassle rewards program: 1% for all purchases, with 3% on gas and groceries. Thus, this is a great card for your everyday purchases since the 3% on gas and groceries really adds up and is more than you would get from other cards. This card also does not require minimum spend, thus unlike Amex Blue, you get the bonus cash back regardless. You can link this card to your BofA account and never worry about forgetting to pay the bill every month.","1055":"I've had the BoA Cash Rewards card for about a year now. I initially applied for it because it was one of the easier cards to get that wasn't an unsecured card. I wanted to build up my credit, and it did do the job. I was disappointed in the rewards though. Although I used the card frequently, it felt like I was barely earning anything extra. I could have gone with a secured card with no rewards and have pretty much the same experience. The interest rate also was higher for this card than some of the others I have, which is probably why it's so easy to attain. It's a good starter card, or if you have bad credit and want to build it back up. It's not useful otherwise.","1056":"I decided to get this credit card because I wanted to transfer my balance from a higher interest credit card. This card had an easy application process, and I was able to complete online. They told me instantly that I was approved and allowed me to transfer my balance then. While the card was easy to obtain, it does not have the best offers anymore. There are now cards out there that offer longer 0% interest on balance transfers or give rewards. This is a pretty basic card compared to others on the market. I'd recommend it to someone who wants a basic card, but not to someone who is really wanting the most competitive card out there.","1057":"I only fly once or twice a year, so a card with an annual fee is not worth it to me. I do use public trains to commute to work every weekday, so this card is a good helper for both those needs. I recently took a trip to Taipei and at places that accepted credit cards it worked great. I love no foreign exchange fees with a good point system to support it. I get even more points if I use Bank of America's travel portal to book flights or hotels, and if you are a Bank of America deposit customer (Checking, Saving, or Merrill Lynch) you get an additional 10% points (1.65 without portal and 3.15 with their portal).","1058":"Ive been a Bank of America customer forever it seems, with both checking and savings accounts. So for me, it only seemed natural that my primary credit card eventually became a Bank of America credit card. Over the years Ive had plenty of credit cards, but this particular one is quite impressive! The rewards go far beyond my original expectations. The customer service, it always adequate, and the simplicity of being able to manage all of my accounts on the same site, well, that is what sold me on the Cash Rewards card in the first place!","1059":"This card is great in terms of the cash back i am getting. Bank of America is always on time in delivering the cash back rewards. Although the reward is not too high I am always getting cash back on whatever I buy.","1990":"Since I have a flexible schedule I can fly at low mileage days. September through April I fly all over central america and the islands and always less than $100 round trip. At least once a month. Detroit to Cancun is $48. Hint: look for the black triangle on the mileage calendar. This winter already been to Mexico 3 times, Panama and Honduras.","3396":"Solid Bank I have been banking with Bank of America here for 4 years. My review here will be limited to online banking for checking and savings accounts and customer service in branch. I find the online banking interface to be intuitive and reliable. I've not ever experienced a problem and can receive assistance there for just about all my banking needs. I do have one issue with the fees which I find a little high. The free checking is only free if you receive a qualifying direct deposit within the calendar month. If not, the fee is $12 which seems a little steep to me. Also if you for any reason need to actually go into the branch for assistance be prepared to wait a while even if you make an appointment. My experience has been that the customer service staff seem put out to help you in person and expressed politely that what I needed assistance with could have been taken care of through online banking. Obviously this was not the case because if it were I would have done it that way. I found that a little troubling. But overall they have been a decent bank to deal with.","1991":"This is a great card if you have a Fidelity brokerage account. There is no minimum to spend and you get 1.5% (2% if its the American Express) in cash back on all purchases if you deposit into your Fidelity account. This is pretty good considering most cash back cards offer 1% or have a minimum spending threshold to get the higher cash back rewards. The only downside to this card is there is a foreign transaction fee if you use this while traveling and it does have rather high interest rates. I pay off all my balances in full but if you tend to carry balances, this may not be the best card for you.","1992":"Just got approved for this card a couple of days ago. They currently have a promotion of 18mo 0% interest on Balance Transfers only. Which was exactly what I needed it for. My Cap1 promotion ended this month so I wanted to transfer my balance. BofA charges a 3% fee on the transfer but I'm still saving $$$ in the long run by not paying interest. Excellent card if you're using it for this purpose. Btw.. I have fair credit 640\/650 scores.","3397":"Deposit Confusion On Saturday at 8:30pm I deposited a check of $200 into my savings account at BOA thru the ATM in my home town. I was told when RE opening my accounts after numerous issues with them from 2012 that $100 clears automatically and the rest would be pending. Fair enough I thought so I made the deposit like my branch teller instructed me to do thru the ATM if it was after business hours. After making the deposit I did a balance in quarry and saw that only $45 was available and the rest was processing. Today (Sunday) I stopped at the ATM to check on what was going on with my account and saw I only had $11.99!! Being the mother of a 9 month old and needing to do shopping I immediately called customer service. At first the women was very confusing and told me 2 diff deposits before she got to the one I had called about and then continued to tell me that of the $200 that $155 was made available to me when it was not. She then had me on hold for over 20 min waiting for a supervisor to give her the ok to credit my account the $$ which I felt was very kind. 10 min later I am told only $50 will be made available and that I would receive the rest on TUESDAY Feb.2nd since they didn't processes checks over the weekend even tho tomorrow is MONDAY and the remaining balance was only $100 if they were crediting my account a measly $50. What the @#$% are they talking about and does any of this sound right???","1993":"Bank of America does not care about their customers at all!! Find another bank! Make a mistake and they will nail you for every charge they can. Wish I could leave 0 stars!! I will be leaving this bank as soon as stuff clears and I just bought new checks. Try to call and they are so rude and just talk over you. Managers have not authority to do anything and they just blame the computers. RUN and find another bank. I am so upset and been a customer since 2005.","1994":"I would stay away! I have a credit score over 800 and got a Bass Pro card when offered an incentive for a discount on a large purchase. I know it takes a while to get the first bill but this one took 90 days. When I got it I was told I was past due 60 days. I called and tried to talk through this. I said I didn't get an 800 FICO by not paying my bills! I immediately paid the full amount and haven't used it since. B of A was nice enough to send a report to all three credit bureaus stating I was 60 days late. My FICO dropped 75 points!","1995":"Comparable to the Amex Blue Cash, with fixed categories which make it easy to remember when to swipe, but Visa network, which is accepted everywhere.Best for Gas at 3%, which complements the Amex Blue cash (3% groceries) nicelyNo annual fee makes it a good candidate for your credit card portfolio.Account can be managed in one integrated place along with other Bank of America accounts.Card also offers specific retailer offers that you have to load on the card prior to your purchase. 10% cash back bonus deals or $5 back are common.","1996":"DO NOT USE THIS CARD. This is the worst rewards card that I have ever seen. In addition to an annual fee, the points are valued at approximately $.005. If you pay with points and fly during regular or peak times, a normally $300 round trip ticket will cost you 30,000 points each way. Literally, this is the worst points value that I have ever seen. By the way, after you redeem points for tickets, you still need to pay around $100.00 in taxes and fees per ticket.You are way better off with Chase Ultimate Rewards, Capital One Venture, Amex, Barclays, or pretty much any other rewards card provider.The only reason that I even signed up for this card is because the flight attendant on the flight blatantly lied about points value. She presented it as though I could get a round trip flight after spending around $2500.00.Also, the airline charges fees for anything and everything. I'm surprised that they don't charge you for wearing shoes on the plane. Seriously, look up some of the ridiculous fees.","1997":"I've banked with many banks, and still have several accounts with large institutions such as USAA, Merrill Lynch, etc. I used the convenient no fee checking that BoA offers that keeps you processing transactions at the ATM only. ALL Web based, etc. Works for me! Right? Sort of. BoA has bad reviews all over for the fees they charge, but I ignored them thinking they can't be THAT bad. I admit, I never kept a large balance, if ANY balance in this account, because I simply use my CC for all purchases to get points for travel. Only on the occasion do I use this account for groceries, eating out, etc. Nevertheless, I paid BoA so many \"overdraft fees\" that were suspicious to say the least. For example. I was in Dallas on business, and the night before I came back I saw the low balance of about $59 left in the account, with only 1 bill Pending at the time. I knew I had a check floating out there, so I decided to withdraw funds from my savings, and deposit it the following morning at 7 am. Mind you, I checked the account the previous night while in bed after 10 pm. I went to deposit, and lo and behold, that check written over a month ago was miraculously charged through. NOT PENDING, but cleared entirely. This over drafted my account, and the money I deposited brought it back up to a single dollar. I called and notified them of this, and they stood by their charge of $35 on the account. Sure, I know this is ultimately my fault, however, the timing of things is what is questionable. This is not the only time this happened. I've had several overdrafts because of EXACTLY this same thing. A check is written, and never seems to go through, UNTIL the available balance seems to be lower than what it can cover. Resulting in an overdraft fee. Each time, I have deposited funds to more than cover it, when it was never shown in the account to begin with, but suddenly it clears with no processing time, or nothing. I find that odd, how some checks will process for 2 sometimes 3 days, but only when there are funds to cover it, but when there aren't sufficient funds, they process right away, and are posted as if they were ran through before any other charges were completed.BoA is killing customers with fees, and it is a shame because most would think I can't balance a check book, but the fact remains, I have enough in my savings accounts to live comfortably. I just don't use BoA for that money because their rates are bad, and they aren't anything more than a pay for pizza bank, and in my book, never will be.Save your money, go with a local credit union, and enjoy higher returns on savings. Avoid Bank of America and their fees, because that it the business they're truly in, not your well being.","1998":"Don't be fooled by this there is no such thing like that, I used the card for a whole year and put on it almost $20,000 and paid off every amount by the end of the cycling period and it past a year then when I applied for a regular credit card on the same account I was rejected I do not know but they sure used you deposite to make money during that one year.","1510":"I recently got the Bank of American Cash rewards Mastercard . The period with no interest on purchases has been a lifesaver, especially around the holiday. This has allowed me to pay off some other things that have higher interest while still being able to afford Christmas presents. The rewards for the card are a great added bonus as well. If you need something to get you by, this is a great card.","1999":"This is your standard credit card. It has all the features like online banking and customer service that other cards also have. The APR is competitive and is similar to offers from other firms. The card does lack some of the cash back feature that other firms have, namely Chase. I have no issues with using this card and I would suggest this card to anyone who is looking for a simple card to use.","1511":"I have been using this card for a little over 4 and a half years now, and I find them to be of pretty good service no matter what the problem is. I was so happy when I first started using the service, because they are not impersonal like so many other credit card companies that I have had to deal with. Unlike the ones of the past that i have had to deal with, these ones give me what I want and when I want it. They are very accommodating to my needs.","1513":"This is a pretty good card. I earn back cash on most of my purchases that I use. I have a 0% interest rate and use it regularly. I use it for gas and everyday things and just pay the bill at the end of the month. The bonus is that I get money back for the things that I would be getting anyways. That's what makes this card so great.","1512":"My husband and I love this card and we use it to pay for everything: gas, groceries, utilities, eating out, college tuition!I love how I don't have to do anything special to get the cash back. We're getting 3% back on gas, and that is one commodity that we tend to go through quickly. Every time we accumulate $25 in rewards, it pays out cash. We tend to take that and tuck it back in, using it to pay on our balance.We do keep a budget and we stay on that, paying off the balance in full each month. Getting that extra cash back is a perk I'd never give up!","1514":"This is a pretty good card. I earn back cash on most of my purchases that I use. I have a 0% interest rate and use it regularly. I use it for gas and everyday things and just pay the bill at the end of the month. The bonus is that I get money back for the things that I would be getting anyways. That's what makes this card so great.","1515":"I have had the MasterCard Pink Ribbon Credit Card for about 6 mos now. I love the rewards and bonus structure that is synonomous with this card. I make a lot of everyday purchases that help rack up points which is very convenient. I had very bad credit when I got this card, but I have already seen an improvement. The charity this supports is a good one, but either way, it feels good to help in some way. It would be nice to have a lower interest rate, but I can live with it to improve my credit. Customer service is a breeze, unlike some of my other cards. I also like using it as an automatic bill pay feature.","1516":"I LOVE THIS CARD! it makes me want to shop more and do more with the incentive of getting cash back, which ALWAYS comes in handy! since i recently moved into a huge house that needed a LOT of things, having the card made it exceptionally easy not only to decorate, but knowing that i would get cash back later that i could use to pay part of the bill was very exciting to me. i havent had the card that long, but so far i have gotten over $100 in cash back (which means that yes, i tend to shop a great deal lol). you simply cant go wrong with this card. another thing that i like about it is the fact that after 3 months, BOFA just gives you a $100 bonus, which im SO looking foward to!","1517":"The card itself is good, but there are no rewards for it like some of Bank of America's other credit cards which sets it apart in a bad way. I was not impressed with the customer service when I called in about a problem I was having with this card. They do not seem to appreciate their own customers. I would not recommend this card unless you don't have other options to go with.","1518":"I really enjoy using this credit card with Bank of America. I've tried using credit cards at other banks before and was met with so many underlying and hidden fees and problems--Bank of America never gives me those problems. I like using this card's reward system--pays out fast and is easy to use. Get a lot of rewards for just doing the things you would usually be doing\/paying for. The interest rate is 0 for the first year, and then is about 11-22% for the years afterwards. I know it's a bit high, but it's worth it and a good rate in comparison to some other cards. Over all, I would recommend this card to others that are interested in setting up a credit account. One of my favorites.","1519":"I like this card because I travel often, and with that, I would normally be charged international fees for using an American card abroad. This card remedies this issue, it does not charge me any foreign transaction fees, thus making my credit card use abroad seem seamless and smooth. I would recommend this card for those who travel a lot and do not with to pay an annual fee.","60":"BOA is the worst bank ever, the Monthly Maintenance Fee is injustice and unfair, it is completely aginst the law. They try to make more benefits and money from the pockets of people with lower income. So those ignorant individuals who are in charge of this organization will make more annual money.","61":"The application process was very much easier to navigate in the U.S Pride Credit card.Purchasing online was an exceptional thing.The customer service was sophisticated.It gives a technical and professional look to my card.The major thing that they have to be developed is to ease with customers when they do approach for particular designs and varieties should be made in card designs.","62":"Best feature of this card is that it earns you 3% back on gas. I use it to purchase all my gas and it earns me more than on most other cards. I also like the feature that i can use the cash to get cash back or for unique mlb experiences and merchandise.","63":"Bank Americard Cash Rewards is a great rewards card to have in your wallet. It offers 3% cash back on gas, 2% on groceries and 1% on general purchases. The gas and grocery rewards are excellent, although I use other cards for general spending. In addition to the cash back rewards, you get an extra 10% by depositing the cash back into a Bank of America checking account. Bank Americard Cash Rewards has no annual fee.","64":"I am satisfied with this credit card. Not very many credit cards provide 2% cash back everywhere, on everything. I do not need to worry about whether my purchase is for a restaurant, gasoline, or groceries; I get the 2% no matter what. Only thing I have a complaint about is the ease of use for redeeming my cash back. Website for this activity is a little cumbersome and hard to navigate, but eventually you get the hang of it. Overall, I would recommend this credit card to anyone and everyone.","65":"It provides nice cash rewards overall. It's the one I usually use for gas and purchase from major grocery stores. It has no annual fees which is nice. I also like that I get an additional 10% on top of my rewards when depositing it in my Bank of America account. Cashing the rewards is fairly easy and quick. One thing I don't like is the new security chip. I've been having problems swiping it in some places.","66":"DO NOT GET THIS CARD!!!! I repeat DO NOT GET THIS CARD!!!! I signed up with spirit as one of their promotions while I was on one of their flights. At first I was told that just by signing up I get 15,000 miles. I signed up because I was short on cash and didn't have a return ticket back home yet. When I later called to see if I can redeem the miles, I found out that my miles would become available after the first purchase. Well ok, that's reasonable. So, when my card came in I made a purchase on it and called them back again to redeem my miles. THEIR STORY CHANGED A SECOND TIME! Now all of a sudden I find out that my miles wouldn't be available until after my first billing cycle. Wtf, I have to go home. I thought whatever, I'm going to be flying again soon anyway, I can use my miles at that point. Well now it's been a month and a half later, I'm trying to use my miles (which should be 15,150 by now) and it shows that I have 0 miles in my account! When I call them THEY CHANGE THEIR STORY A THIRD TIME! Now all of a sudden they want me to wait until after the second billing cycle. When I told them I feel like I'm being scammed they said no because I signed the terms and agreements. I READ THE TERMS AND AGREEMENTS FROM BEGINNING TO END AND IT SAID NOTHING OF WHAT THEY'RE TELLING ME ON THE PHONE! Its been over two months after I signed up and they want me to wait another month. I just want what was promised to me!","67":"I used to have a debit card attached to a checking account with them some years back, while I was an exchange student in Connecticut. The debit card was very easy to apply for, and the tellers were always very nice and polite. I used my card to pay for everything, commission free, and I never had any security issues. All in all I was very satisfied with their product and services.","68":"Had the Chase card since 2007 and used it for everything. Earned so many points and free trips. Bank of America's version looks even better! One small problem, they won't approve me for one. I have a credit score of 729 (good) and $8,000 in credit limits with a very low utilization. We're talking single digits. Five stars for the Chase version. One star for the Bank of America version. Maybe if I jump through enough hoops I can earn the card... one day.","2868":"And when you do the agents you speak to are very often unable to resolve your problem.  That's not their fault, they're under trained, under empowered and most likely not BoA employees.I have had, over the last few years, bank accounts in 6 countries and BoA without a doubt offers the worst customer service of any of them - by quite a long way.Search their web site for as long as you like and you won't find a way of making a complaint.  I think that probably says all you need to know!","69":"I really liked this checking account as a student in upstate NY. The best benefit was the fact that there are no monthly fees. Also, the ease of use for the mobile app made banking easy for a college kid. Mobile depositing for someone in school is a must, its sometimes hard\/difficult to get off campus and to a bank so that feature really made it great.","590":"I opened a Bank of America checking account in high school, and was able to maintain the same account throughout college with no monthly fees. When I graduated college, Bank of America made me switch my student account for a normal account, which sadly included monthly fees. They had a promotion at the time that if you opened a savings account at the same time, and had a set monthly transfer of at least $25 from your checking to your savings account then you could avoid monthly fees. Obviously, I opened up a savings account that day. The things I like about my savings account are that I can transfer immediately between my checking and savings and that there are no transfer fees between my accounts. The interest rate is low though, and I know that I should be investing this money rather than just saving it, especially at my age. This savings account is okay, but there are definitely better options out there.","591":"I opened a Bank of America checking account my senior year in high school, at that time they put me under a college student account which did not have a monthly fee. They were very accommodating at the time, helped me through every step of the process and were always available to answer every question. One time in college I got charged an overdraft fee, went to my local bank and they actually were able to remove my overdraft fee and give me a day leeway. Which is amazing. Now that I'm out of college though they don't really have a great interest account, you can avoid the monthly fee if you have $25 transferred to a savings account every month but I definitely know that there are better banks out there. I'm currently too lazy to switch? Which is a horrible grown-up adult thing to say. Bottom line: They were a great bank when I was in college but now that I actually have money to invest and deal with, there are much better options out there.","3398":"Think once, think twice, and think again if you find yourself considering putting your money in here Where to begin... I made one of the worst personal finance decisions of my life when I opened an account here at a wistful 19 years old. Poor young me had no idea what he was in for with this fraudulent, selfish, and irresponsible bank. The experience that caused me to finally leave... after the countless fees and random changes in policy that ended up costing me too much money, was my account being hacked after using an ATM outside of one of the banks own locations. ALL of my funds were stolen in this incident, and it took me over a month for Bank of America to accept responsibility and replace the money in my account. And after they finally got around to that, it took another month, 2 months total, for them to issue me a new debit card. If you like writing $5 checks and being hassled trying to withdraw money in person without an active debit card, I would say go for it. Open an account here. But if you value your money and your sanity, avoid this cursed institution like the plague.","592":"I've had bank of america checking since I was 16. When i first had it, it was a student checking account, but upon graduating college, i switched over to a Core checking account. The $12 monthly fee is waived as long as you have direct deposit. The only thing I do not like is the $35 overdraft fee which sometimes can happen. A couple of times bank of america has waived it for me. I also enjoy the simplicity of their online banking! My husband uses another bank and his online account is almost impossible to understand. With bank of america, everything is simple and straightforward and I know exactly how much I have and what's come out and what is still pending. Great bank!!!","593":"This card does not really state what the conversion rate of it's reward points are. So while getting 20,000 points after spending $1000 seem like a good deal, i really don't know what I can get with that. Redeeming points for travel purposes seems very appealing. But the high, variable interest rate does not.","594":"I received offer while purchasing tix on spirit website.Lured by the $100 discount if spending $500 within 90 days and miles right off the bat. I applied and wanted to use card for my spirit purchase.I have a 785 credit score and was not immediately approved wich kind od ruined the whole purpose of applying.I tried 3 times to cxl my application but was not able to find someone who could do that.Just saying...","595":"Bank of America has been a great bank for me. I have been a customer for over 20 years. I started with a basic checking account years ago and have now moved onto the bigger and better accounts. I could not be happier with this bank and the savings account! I\u2019m really happy with the higher interest rates, and as long as you keep enough money in the bank, then there are no monthly service fees. I couldn\u2019t be happier with free banking! The customer service here is by far better than any other bank I have used in the past. I will be a forever customer.","596":"Well I signed up for BofA as a student. I got an waiver for the fee which is great. I honestly don't know when the waiver is going to be waived because I'm not a student anymore but for now I still have the waiver. Good bank and I like how they added digital tellers!","597":"I have been with Bank of America for about 7 years. I have a checking account with direct deposit and a savings account. I wish that I could say that I am happy with them but I really am not completely happy. I stay with them mainly for convenience reasons and because it's really a huge pain to switch banks. But, that just means I have been loyal to them, not that they really care. I have a direct deposit to my account. I was away on maternity leave for 6 weeks and wasn't getting paid. They refused to waive the fee for me due to not getting direct deposit for that time. I was a new mom and a single one at that NOT getting paid at all for maternity leave and because I wasn't getting a direct deposit they charged me a fee for my savings account. After being with them for so long that was pretty infuriating.Additionally, they have charged me overdraft fees of $35 when the overdraft had not even occurred! The latest time I was charged for a daycare check that was still processing. I had money in the process of being transferred from my Paypal and the check had not even cleared and they charged the overdraft fee. Even if you overdraft by .50 they charge you a $35 fee. It's sickening. I had to fight with them for WEEKS to get that fee reversed. They refused and refused even though the Paypal money posted BEFORE the check cleared. They argued with me saying the check wasn't what put me over, that a $25 grocery store charge that had already cleared put me over which made no sense because that would only have over drafted me if they check had already been taken out of my account. They just kept talking their way around it.The customer service is ok, not great, just ok. The one thing I can say is that they are good about handling unauthorized charges. They have handled a few fraud cases for me over the past 7 years and they always get me my money back. That is probably a key factor in my staying with them.They have a banking app that is great but it doesn't always completely sync up with what they have in their system so be cognizant of that.Overall, they are ok. If you don't ever have to worry about over drafting or savings account fees, you should be fine.","3399":"Bank of America Review I think Bank of America is an okay bank you certainly could probably find some better alternatives. From my experience they have a decent team of people at any of the branches I've been to with good experience and a good way of helping their customers. They are always quick and friendly to get you back on your way. The fees are kind of bad I get $12 in maintenance fees taken away every month. The app they have and website works well on a variety of platforms and their apps are always getting updates and have gotten easier to use with more intuitive interfaces. Some of the good features that they have is the ability to cash a check through their atm it is a really painless and simple process and now you can also cash checks from your phone. I think they are competitive and provide comparable services to other banks. Savings and checking accounts are easy to manage. Transfers are generally painless although they do take some time. Using their electronic wire transfers works well and I have never had issue with that or setting up direct deposits.","950":"I love using Bank of America for my checking account needs. BOA apps provide you with up to date information about account activity. It is very easy to transfer money online or via the app. Going into my local branch is also pleasurable, the employees are kind, courteous and friendly. This is such a refreshing change after banking with Key for the last couple of years and not being able to view up to date information either through atm receipts or the online App. BOA also shows me bills that I have paid on line within 24 hours unlike the other financial institution that I was using. I would recommend this bank to anyone!!!","598":"I've had my checking account with Bank of America for about five years now, and I wish I could say I am satisfied overall, but unfortunately that isn't the case. My overall experience I have to say has been below average - my main issue is that I've more than once been charged an overdraft fee of $35, when I had never actually had my account overdrafted - nor even came close to it. Each time when I brought this ridiculousness to their attention, they rectified the problem and credited my account, but in my opinion mistakes like this are unacceptable and could potentially cause significant problems for a customer, above and beyond the inherent hassles involved with making time to notify them of their errors. What if my account was funded just enough to remit a bill payment I had scheduled when they arbitrarily sucked out $35 from my account on a whim, with zero notice or notification?On the brighter side, BoA's customer service has always been reasonably helpful and attentive whenever I've needed assistance from them.","599":"I had this account for when i was a student and I like it. It really helped that there were no fees while you were a student and I didn't have to have a minimum balance. It was easy to deposit money via the app and the ATM but I liked using the tellers. The flexibility of how to make deposits was the only thing that really made it special, I felt.","952":"I like my Bank of America regular savings accounts because I can use the linked checking account to save money easily. I have the \"keep the change\" monies going in directly from my checking account each month. I also like having my savings account set up to cover any accidents that might occur on my checking account with an overdraft protection. This actually did come in handy once, when a store clerk double rang my card and caused me to go into the red in my checking, my savings account had enough in it to cover it. The main thing I do not like about that is how much money they charge for you being able to use your own money to do this. This was 25 dollars it cost me and I thought that was highway robbery. It is what it is, other than that I really like my account. I would say that if they raise that rate much more, I would consider moving my account but for now since I don't plan on using overdraft protection much, It is okay.","951":"It's middle of the road. I started out with a student account. That was great because there was no fees and I didn't have to meet minimums. Once that ended I had to have so over $2500 or transfer money every month and that got a little tedious. This account doesn't really earn any tangible money in interest. Even over $15000 in the bank, I\u2019m getting less than a quarter of a dollar per month. The service of the bank was the only saving grace because I could use the mobile app and there are always branches near me to help with any issue. Anytime I had a problem it was resolved with a phone call in a few days.","953":"Had a terrible experience with this savings account. First, the \"keep the change\" feature is almost impossible to deactivate since you have to talk to customer service and it takes really long to get transferred to a human. Second, because I kept getting money deposited in there and I can't afford to save right now, I would transfer the money back to my checking once it reached 30 dollars or more. Well, turns out they charge you after your third transaction so I ended up paying $18 dollars in fees from using it too much. Needless to say, I am no longer a bank of america customer.","954":"I am not usually able to donate a lot of money to charities, but when I do, I donate to the ASPCA. I know that there might be greater troubles out there, but this is one of the best things I can do for the moment. I somewhat like the rewards process since I get some money back, but I feel like the amounts of the rewards are not really going back into the sole purpose of the organization, which is to help abused animals. I have saved many pets who were on the brink of death, and have taken them to the ASPCA. They took care of them, and helped save their lives. I am very grateful to them, which is why I keep on donating to them.","955":"Had a Bank of America account for many years was overall very satisfied with their service. Online banking was easy and their mobile app was outstanding. Unfortunaly the ATM that they had in our town went away and then the closest branch to us also closed. I wish that they had not because there are times that I wish to bank in person and not just online. They lost a customer in MI because of this","957":"This was my first credit card just because I was already a customer with Bank of America. It's a decent card and is accepted most places. The cash back options are average but at least you can build them up and put them towards your bill. It is easy to pay off online, by phone, or through the mobile app.","956":"Bank of America checking is a pretty straight forward checking account. I have been a customer with them for about ten years. I have only had issues with my checking account a few times during that time so I would say they are pretty low maintenance, but when I have had issues it is very difficult to find someone who is willing to help resolve them. I logged about four hours trying to resolve my last issue with them.","958":"The Bank of America Cash Reward card seems like an awesome card, at least compared to my Citi Card where you earn \"easy points\" that have very little value. To earn cash back for groceries, fuel, and other purchases would encourage me to use this card for every daily purchase. After reading the terms I am considering switching to this card.","959":"The AAA Member Rewards Credit Card has a decent rewards program and no annual fee, but the APR is pretty high. This is a good card for people who use their credit card instead of a debit card and pay it off in full every month. I also like that it has the smart chip technology because it's much safer than just the magnetic strip.","1650":"bank of America is one of the best banks I've ever used.I trade stocks online so most of my money is ACH transfers through online banking.Bank of America really make banking online easy and simple for there customers and the customer service is very helpful when I run into problems.I would like to say that i used other banks for my online business,but nothing really compare to Bank of America and the way they run there banking business,there fess and how they work with you to lower your fees.I've been with this bank for 5 years and i have not ran into any major problems with bank of America,I love Bank of America and highly recommend it....","3400":"Funds Not Available I deposited a check and it took one week for my pay check to clear so funds can be available. I will be closing my account shortly because Bank of America is not a bank you can trust.","1651":"I had a checking account through Bank of America for years. The ability to have so many locations was a nice convenience, but after so long, I could no longer justify how horrible their customer service and practices were. Fees on everything, The customer was never write, no matter how much evidence they were given to the contrary. They knew they had you and there was nothing you could do about it. Get everything in explicit writing. Or better yet, go somewhere else.","1652":"with the Bank of America cash reward card I earned over 150.00 in 3 months and I love the fact that I get 3 percent cash back in gas because I use over 300 in gas. I love that it doesn't change the percentage at all.","1653":"Was supposed to get $50 booking credit when applying for card, was charged full amount no credit given","1654":"I opened a business account at Bank of America about two years ago and haven't had a problem since. I switched due to the high fees and transfer rates my previous bank was charging Bank of Americas rates are much more reasonable. It is very convenient that they offer online banking as well as online transfers, a feature i use regularly. Overall i am very satisfied where their service reliability and convience and strongly recommend them to others.","1655":"Like most people, i only write a review if something is extraordinarily bad for really fantastic. I'm writing this review because this is the worst credit card\/ customer service I have ever received in my life. I mean absolutely ridiculous. STAY AWAY!! Bank of America is horrible. I have had people tell me the same thing. I look at the rating of 3.6 from about 200 reviewers at the time I'm writing my review and I think \"all the positive reviews must have been written by BOA employees\", read BOGUS REVIEWS. Like I said---STAY AWAY.","1656":"I've had this savings account for a few years now; I opened mine in college. It's an ok savings account. Because I'm young and broke all the time, I set up the service where your overdrafts come from your savings, which is of course a whole lot better than paying $35 for each separate overdrafted transaction. B of A is also everywhere so it's a very convenient bank to have while traveling. I'd switch to a credit union, though, if there were some more close by, because I've heard they're less evil than giant banks. Either way I suppose it doesn't really matter, since an individual can't change much is the vast consumer wasteland that is the United States. I also like that I can deposit checks without an envelope.","1658":"I liked it at first. But when I fell behind on payments the interest kept killing me. I got deeply in debt and tried to cancel. They said they couldn't cancel until my payments were current. My interest kept going up and I ended up in collections.","1657":"This card is ok, but not great based on my opinion. I did like the two percent cash back on groceries and the three percent cash back on fuel. I always made my monthly payments on or ahead of time. I was out of work for a short period of time due to personal matters. I explained to them what was going on, but still made a couple Partial payments. I was charge high interest rates that made it hard for me to get catchup on my payments. I really disagree with the cashback interest rates.","1659":"I had a very positive experience with my Savings account with Bank of America. The application process was painless. The gentleman who assisted me was very friendly and knew every answer to all my many question. He fully explained everything I needed to know and even what I didn't want to know. I felt secure and safe. I would highly recommend going through Bank of America for your savings needs! Over the years I have grown my investments and felt very confident that everything will be taken care of. If you ever have any questions, they are either a phone call or quick office visit away. No regrets! Thank you Bank of America!","400":"I have had a Bank of America Savings Account for about 12 years. In general it has served me well. I get monthly account summaries like clockwork and whenever I have had any questions their customer service representatives have been extremely helpful. Bank of America has transformed with the times, having apps and text features which make it much easier to access my accounts. These innovative things have truly helped keep the bank current and have assisted in making customers like myself happy. I have never had an issue with the bank policies and I expect I will continue to have a happy relationship with Bank of America for a long time.","401":"I have had the Bank of America Savings Account for over ten years now. Overall, I like it. It is easy to transfer money to and from my other Bank of America accounts (ie., checking and my credit card). I am not a huge fan of the \"Keep the Change\" feature in which Bank of America takes your checking account purchases, rounds them up to the nearest dollar, and deposits that amount into your savings account. As a graduate student, there are times when my checking account runs a bit lower than I would like and having to transfer my \"Keep the Change\" dollars over from my savings account back into my checking account can get tedious.","402":"This MasterCard is Great, it pays you $100 Dollars a year just for having the Card and if you have a Savings or Checking Account with Them then you will get $120 a year instead of the $100 plus 0% interests on Purchases and Balance Transfers for 1 year.....","403":"This Credit Card requires an even higher level of Credit than the Cash Rewards One............The 1.5% Rewards when converted to CASH it will be only 0.9% and this Credit Card does NOT offer 0% Balance Transfers like the other ones....","404":"This Credit Card doesn't offer anything, it is a waste of time....","405":"i've had this credit card and to me there are much better options from bank of america, i cancelled this one...","408":"My checking account with bank of America is by far the best account I have ever had. I never receive any surprise fees. Its easy to cash my checks at any atm. The customer service is always fantastic. Ive set up overdraft protection on my account. im very happy with this bank and its service. I feel like they actually care about their customers.","406":"I really like my BOA checking account. I have had it for over 8 years now and no complaints. BOA has recently added a \"Cash Back\" feature, where you can pick from a list of 20-30 stores at a time and if you shop there, you will get 5-20% (depending on store) back in your account. Most of the stores are places I go regularly, like Starbucks and Sears. BOA customer service has always helped me out with issues on my checking account, specially when I was out of work and had a few Overdraft issues. They added overdraft protection for me, as well as out of courtesy removed all fees that hit my account.I think BOA is a great bank to try out if you need to open checking or savings","407":"I have had my Checking Account with Bank of America for over 2 years now through Payoneer. This checking account was used mostly for online banking and purchasing. I have never had any problems with this bank. I have received money from my online job without a problem as well. The fees are low and withdrawing for an ATM has never been a problem. I would highly recommend this bank to anyone looking for a new checking account.","720":"I've had a savings account with Bank of America for over 10 years now. When I first started, it was due to a feature they no longer offer (that I know of, as it has stopped happening on my account). Every transaction with your debit card resulted in funds automatically being rounded up to the next dollar and the difference between that amount and the actual transaction transferred to your savings account. As a result, I built a nice savings balance without much effort on my part. I have automatic transfers set up from my checking account to savings, and when it gets to a certain amount I move it to a savings CD. The rate on the CD is much better than that of the regular savings account, but the funds are not as easily accessible. Because of this, I enjoy those options. It feels good knowing money you would just have sitting around gaining interest can gain a bit more when transferred over to another savings product with a higher rate. All in all, I'm satisfied with my Bank of America savings account. I just wish they'd bring back the transaction rounding.","409":"My experience with saving with Bank Of America has been overwhelmingly positive. I've tried the other banks and none of them compare. I can go online and check my balance. I can transfer between my savings account and bank account instantly. Any time I've ever had a problem with an overdraft fee, I spoke with customer service and was got all of the issues resolved immediately.. Everyone in customer service is helpful and friendly. You can't beat being able to put your paychecks in and directly to the ATM and getting the money in your account without even going into the bank, or speaking with a banker. Over all I would recommend this bank to anyone, friends and family included. There are never any surprise fees so you always know what you can save and what to expect from this bank.","721":"I've had a checking account here for at least six years. I've never had any major problems and so have never needed any serious customer service support to resolve major problems. I considered closing the account due to the monthly fee that results when you don't have any real income however I kept it because of ease of access when traveling domestically and in Canada. I had no issues accessing my money in any part of the US. I would recommend an checking account here based solely on this. The online and mobile banking systems are competent easy to use and I have never had problems with them.","722":"I've been a Bank of America customer for several years now and decided to apply for a card while rebuilding my credit. I figured that it would help that we already have a prior relationship, and I wanted the card solely as a means of building better credit. I qualified for the Better Balance Rewards card, which gives me $30 every quarter so long as I pay more than the minimum monthly balance every month (it's $25 a quarter for non-BoA banking customers). This is easy for me since I mainly just use it to buy lunch or coffee a couple times a month. When I first qualified, I also got a year at 0% APR, which was helpful when I had an emergency auto repair.","723":"One time I tried to make a purchase while money was in transit from savings to checking. Since the transfer wasn't complete, my checking account overdrafted and tried to withdraw the funds from savings (which had already been emptied). This caused savings to overdraft and attempt to withdraw from checking. Everyday for a week both accounts would overdraft and attempt to withdraw from each other, racking up $60 in fees a day. Customer service acknowledged that it was a flaw on their end but they had no authorization to refund the fees.","724":"Signed with Bank of America in 2013. Seemed like a great deal, especially with the monthly fee being waived since I was a student. My favorite part about BoA was student credit card. I also like their online banking platform. It is convenient to check my balances and make all my payments all from one website.","725":"After I was pick-pocked in Paris they sent a new card to my hotel in 12 hours.","3401":"Would Never Use Again Too many individual employees that don't have a clue. The best help I had was the guy that helped me close my accounts, but at that point it was too little too late. Also debit card charges took three days to appear in online banking. They may have fixed this, it's been a few years.","726":"I have enjoyed my BoA checking account for a few years with little very few problems. One of my biggest frustrations has actually happened twice, for some reason they moved the money from my direct deposit that was supposed to be in checking over to my savings account, this was back when I actually paid my bills with paper checks, and 7 of them bounced. After I got letters from multiple accounts saying that I had bounced check fees I inquired. BoA did a really good job though and paid all the fees and reversed all the fees they had issued me. All in all I like my account with them alot and would recommend them.","727":"I had a really bad experience banking with Bank of America. I used Bank of America solely as a savings account and I had a terrible experience. The application process was quick and easy, they had no problem getting me signed up and having me deposit my money. After signing up is when it all went down hill. After the first month I looked at my savings account and realized money was taken out, albeit it was only a little amount. So I call Bank of America and find out that there is a fee that was not disclosed when I signed up. I talked to two different managers and they said there was nothing they could do about it, while being rather rude.","728":"It is not the best rates out there but it is extremely convenient if you already have accounts with Bank of America. You can open it up right from your on-line portal and start a CD immediately. The customer service is really good, I used on-line chat to help set it up since it was after branch location banking hours. It is a nice option for short terms savings that keeps you from getting to your money easily and encourages me to set back some money for some larger purchases I have coming up in the less than 3 year time frame.","729":"I love this bank. I currently have two banks, one that is linked to my family's account, and this one that I use as my personal bank. I primarily got this bank to obtain a credit card, but I have since moved away from my other bank to solely use this one. I think it has a lot of strengths on its own, but especially in comparison. The interface of the website is friendly, appealing and is functional. Every bit of information I could want from statements, account information, important numbers, and ways to sign up for other programs or open accounts is right there. Customer service is very quick. I have used both the online chat and telephone calls for help with an issue with instant service. I had an issue where I was over drafted for an unauthorized charge and I wasn't aware of it. After using the card a few times, I had an even larger overdraft due to insufficient funds - but all due an unauthorized charge. I called and everything was immediately fixed and smoothed over.Another situation happened that I can't quite remember how it all panned out, but since I had been responsible with that account and the credit account linked, they had given me a benefit for being a good customer. Bank of America has not left me in the dust like my other bank has, and has made it a point to emphasize its appreciation for me being a customer. I don't think customer affirmation is necessarily important, after all I'm being offered a service that is functional, but it makes me feel a lot closer to the bank.Other local things, the hours for the banks meet my needs whenever I need to talk to someone, and I like that I can make deposits through the ATM. The bank employees are all very friendly whenever I do need to talk to them, but I haven't had a dire need to go inside of the bank in about 4 months.","3402":"Bonus Denied Received an offer for a $300 bonus by opening a new checking account and completing $4000 in direct deposits within 90 days. Problem is I did not receive the offer until day 70. I was encouraged to pursue the bonus even though the deadline had passed. My case was escalated twice before I was denied. Offering a bonus with a 90-day deadline on Day 70 seems rather disingenuous. Colossal waste of my time.","2391":"I enjoy using Bank of America. It's an easy and fast way to deposit money anywhere. Awesome online banking system, very easy to use and understand. Good customer service anywhere, I travel quite a bit and can always easily reach an actual person on the phone very quickly. Low monthly checking fees and they have a great traveler's credit card that helps you earn a lot of money back.","2390":"I have been banking with Bank of America since 2004. I have had the good fortune of never really running into any major issues. My favorite part about banking with Bank of America is their online banking platform. It easy really easy and convenient for me to check my balances and make all my payments all from one website. I would also say that they are probably one of the better banks to help protect with Identy theft. I have had lost cards in the past but it was always easy to get them turned off by phone and have them send me a new one. They even verify all your recent purchases with you so you have peace of mind that the lost card hasn't been used since you lost it. The only thing that I don't like about my checking account is when they put a temporary block on my card because of irregular spending. This has happened maybe six times to me ever, but it is really inconvenient. It is pretty easy to get the hold taken off the account by just calling customer service and verifying that it is you that has been using the card, but just an inconvenience.","2869":"I have been a B of A. cardholder since 2000. I have always paid on time, and always more than the minimum payment. Recently, on May 13, 2015 I sent a large payment in of over 18K, paying the entire balance off. That payment was not due until June 2015. Today I spoke with Tony and his Supervisor Carl on the bill I just received today for $26.87. I questioned what it was for, and was told that it was interest? How can you charge interest when you cashed a check on May 14,2015? I asked if they could remove the charge, and was told \"No\"! I then asked for a new Pay off figure, and informed Carl to \"Close My Account\" for good! How could you treat a customer of over 15 years like that? I also have had mortgages with B of A in the past! Guess what, there are plenty of Banks out there, all looking for someone that pays their bills on time! Good by B of A!!! I will never use any account associated with you!!!A Very Disgruntled Customer","3403":"BoA Is Number One Bank of America is my number one bank of choice. I bank with Bank of America for a couple of different reasons. Their customer service is helpful, professional and easy to speak to. Their app is great for when I am on the go and need to check my accounts or make transfers. There is always a Bank of American in any location I travel to. I always recommend Bank of America to friends and family when they ask me who to bank with. When I have a question about banking I can log onto their easy to use website and read through their commonly asked questions forum. Normally, I am able to quickly find my answer and move on to my next task. Their fees are low in comparison to other banks and their website is user friendly. I have banked with Bank of America for many years and intend to continue.","2392":"Overall, this is a fairly average travel rewards card that provides average benefits in comparison to other similar cards. The 1.5% Rewards is a nice feature, and those points do really add up if you are a frequent traveler. The bonus points awarded are a little skimpy in comparison to other cards out there, such as the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card which offers 40,000 points if you spend $4000 in the first 3 months. This is not a bad card, but there are better options.","2393":"I have had a Bank of America Savings account for a about six years now. When I originally signed up, I had a student savings account as I was in college but it was changed to a regular account after I graduated (I believe it automatically switched over after a set number of years). I really like the Keep the Change feature which rounds purchases up to the nearest dollar and deposits the change into your saving account when you link up your checking account. This has made it very easy for me to save. I love Bank of America's mobile app and how easy it is to transfer money from checking to savings and vise versa. The interest rate is not as good as some competitors but with the various tools that Bank of America offers, I have kept this account rather than opening a new one at another bank.","2394":"I got this card because I like AAA. The credit card, however, I did not like. First of all, they'd send me a bill every OTHER month, so when I got it, I always had a late fee on it, which I had to call and get removed. Second, I had a charge from a company that auto-charged me. I called and asked them to cancel and remove the charge, and the company refused. I called the credit card company and tried to dispute it, but they said, \"nah, it's in their terms and conditions\". Credit card companies should PROTECT CONSUMERS from this kind of crap, and they DIDN'T! So 1 star for you AAA.","2395":"I really like the Bankamericard Travel Rewards Visa because it lets me accumulate points for the traveling that I am already doing anyway. It makes it easy to rack up points that I can use for future travels, or just everyday spending. I have had all good experiences so far with this card, and with Bank of America's customer service!","3404":"B of A review Customer service has been excellent over the phone. I have dealt with customer service many times on the phone and have found it easier to get to a person than many other banks with automated phone systems. I have always been able to resolve an issue with the bank within just a few minutes on the phone. I have traveled internationally and never had a problem using my debit card when overseas as long as i informed the bank of my departure before i leave.","2397":"I have a checking account with Bank of America. First and foremost, I find it extremely frustrating that they only have Monday through Friday customer service, with limited hours. Additionally, I am paying a $12 monthly fee. As a former Wells Fargo client, I remember having free accounts by meeting certain requirements (savings acct linked, bill pay). They also had 24 hour customer service. At the very least, I would expect customer service to be readily available. They do, however, have very good policies as far as reversal of fees.","2396":"I have previously complained about the fact that Bank of America charges an exorbitant $12 monthly service charge for accounts that do not keep a balance over so many thousands of dollars. First and foremost, this means (statistically) that over half of the United States must pay fees in order to bank with Bank of America. On two occasions, however, the Bank of America customer service folks were gracious enough to reverse these fees into my account.","2398":"Horrible card. Horrible service. Incompetent people. Can't get ANYTHING resolved. Stay away from Spirit and its incompetent credit cards partners.","1681":"Bank Of America Core Checking has worked very well for me. The online bill pay is great and there are no hidden fees. As long as you make sure you have enough money in your account everything is fine. I would like to see custom designs for the debit cards. Uploading an image online that is placed on your card would be rather cool. One last thing. Watch out for out of network ATM fees!","2399":"This checking account is alright. The only bad part is the overdraft fees. It's fun that they will put your picture on your card if you ask. I also like that they have a lot of ATMs. They have minimal fees but not-none. You can expect one or two fees a year plus the monthly fee that comes with the account.","1680":"I had a Bank of America Savings account. I decided to close it after a Customer Service Rep decided to argue with me about how many times in a billing cycle I can withdraw money from my savings account. My mother worked for a bank so I know the total amount of times I am allowed to withdraw without penalty. The rep was rude and mean. I immediately went to the branch the next day and closed my savings account with them. I also explained to the lady that I saw that day the reason for why I was closing and she repeatedly apologized to me saying that is not how a rep should have spoke to me and was there anyway that they could get me to stay. I did not want to keep my savings open with them any longer so I closed it. I will not open another savings account with Bank Of America for a few years if not longer.","1682":"I have this card for about five months and I pretty much had a salt and sweet taste to it. The thing that I really loved about this Bank of America Card was that it had higher cash back reward than most other credit cards in the market currently. The thing that really hate about this card is its online interface. The website is just pure madness so don't even get me stared on the login which is more confusing than learning how to fly a helicopter. Overall besides its ups and downs I really loved this card.","3405":"A reasonably good experience I live in Virginia and this bank is great here. The service is second to none and they have a lot of ATMs. That's why I chose them. BofA is so big that you'll always have an ATM nearby. So that's an added bonus. I really liked the bank.","1683":"I have been with Bank of America for 10 years now and have never been a happier customer. Their customer service is top notch and have great benefits for the checking accounts and awesome rates for their savings account. I would highly recommend this bank to anyone that asks. Bank of America's app is also a great feature. Being able to deposit checks through my phone is an amazing feature. They have always worked with me in unique situations and never blanketed me with generalized solutions to my financial needs. It would take a lot for me to switch banks and be treated the same way. I am known by name at my local branch and feel like part of a community.","1684":"I have had the Pink Ribbon Credit Card from MasterCard,for about 2 years now.This card is very easy to use and the rewards and bonus you get for signing up is really good.I like that you can save for everyday type purchases.Two things I do not like about this card.The interest rate is really high and the charity foundation that this card sends money to uses very little of the money for actual research.","1685":"I love getting my new visa platinum credit card from Bank of America! I'm looking forward to use it and I can take it with me to go shopping at the mall, dining out, buy groceries at the store so I can open up my bank account!","3406":"Better Than I Thought... I have 2 bank accounts. 1 with BofA that I opened when I worked for them in 1999 and last year I opened an account with SunTrust thinking that I may eventually change banks (a real pain in the ass because of BillPay\/Automatic BillPay.) and move away from BofA all together. I move money back and forth between the accounts as needed... Mostly to SunTrust since my plan was to eventually make them my only bank. Without fail SunTrust will hold my funds for 3 days before I have full access to them, which has caused me so overdraw a couple of times (at a $35 charge from SunTrust), or had online BillPay refused for insufficient funds, causing me more fees and late fees from those I am trying to pay. Yes, I know that banking laws say that it \"could take up to 3 days\" for funds to move between banks. Using electronic transfer I can push money from BofA to SunTrust or can pull from BofA from SunTrust. It doesn't matter which way I do it, SunTrust doesn't make the funds available for 3 days. HOWEVER, BofA shows the funds as gone the day of the transfer. To get around this I have found that I get faster access to my money (or at least part of it) if I actually write a check to myself from BofA and deposit it into SunTrust. Even with that, SunTrust puts a hold on part of my funds, even though BofA has already sent the funds to SunTrust. How do I know? The electronic image of my check is available online at BofA the very next day. If I do the reverse and move money from SunTrust to BofA, SunTrust does not release the funds for 3 days but BofA (after verifying the funds are there) makes the money available to me same day. What do I pay for this wonderful service? At SunTrust - $7.50\/month unless I run 10 transactions through the account. At BofA? $0.00 with no stipulations. Totally FREE checking. Comparing the Mobile Banking Apps BofA is great at automatically capturing my check images. Good job there!I used to get really frustrated with BofA but after my experience with SunTrust I will have to say that maybe they are not as bad as I thought. Right now I am going to stick with BofA for the foreseeable future.","3407":"BoA My experience with Bank of America was awesome. I opened a savings account as well as a checking account, and use it for my main banking account. It gathers a nice amount of interest in the savings account and the ATM's are very conveniently located in my town. The card I signed up was free, as were many other services offered to me. The bank is always clean and the tellers are very friendly. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a bank to open an account. It has served me well and I will continue to do business with this bank.","1689":"The cash back offered with this card is much higher than most cards I have had before. The 2% for groceries and 3% for gas cash back amount is a very attractive offer that this card has. Also, the $100.00 bonus upon using your card, and the 0% for 12 months make this card a wonderful credit card. I would definitely recommend this card to anyone.","1688":"I have been a Bank of America customer for about 3 years. The savings account is linked to all of my other accounts. I am most satisfied with the online service. This functions rather well with one exception. I am greeted when I log in with opportunities to learn more about other services. When I click, however, it never works. Thus I feel I might be missing out on something. The fact that virtually no interest is paid on the savings accounts also makes them rather useless - but that is more a consequence of the current era of cheap money than BoA's fault. The transfers between accounts is easy and lightening fast, so overall I am pleased with the service.","1687":"I joined Bank of America checking last year, and after using several banks in the past really love BoA. The checking is easy and the branches are conveniently located. I love the \"keep the change program\" where they round up your purchase amount on your ATM card and automatically place the difference into your savings. Makes it real easy to save and keep track of your checking balance!","1686":"I've had a BOA Savings CD for a while now. Somethings that I love about it are the high interest that I earn on the cash I have saved away. Other things that are great about the account is that BOA has allowed me and the misses to establish a joint account that we each contribute too in order to save up money for funding trips, college funds for our children etc. The staff is always very nice and helpful when working with our savings account and especially making transfers between banks. We also tend to use Online Banking when we manage this account and it is quite easy to navigate through our options. Customer service is also always a pleasure to speak with when we have concerns!","3408":"Customer Service Rating Every thing I visit any branch of Bank of America I face excellent customer service. Teller are pleasant and very helpful. I own a small chain of restaurants and visit most branches located in Northern Virginia, each branch but their all have qualify and professional associates devoted to customer satisfaction. The support received from Bank of America in favor of my business has been essential with out their support I would not be in the restaurant business. Bank of America support in the community many small business would not be able to keep door open, the relationship between Bank of America and the support toward small business is a sample of support to the local economy as well for economy nation wide. Thanks for you all your support. Thanks for your associates committed to serve local communities.","1630":"I think there are some good and bad things with this card. A 25 day grace period is nice, in case you are having trouble paying on time but that APR can get a little high. Personally, I would never use a card that could shoot up to almost 23% after a year. The smart chip is an essential tool to have in a new card so I do like that. Again, I would never take out a cash advance with a 15% fee. It would make more sense to take the time to take a bank loan out instead.","1631":"I have been a long time customer of BoA. I like the service, but I do have one major complain about the fee. There shouldn't be any fee for things like wire transfer fee if you maintain a certain minimum balance. You waive the monthly fee for checking if you have direct deposit. Why do you need to stick me with a fee when someone send me money via wire transfer. Some times the amount is so little that after the transfer fee is applied, the money is gone.","1633":"I have had an account with Bank of America for several years, and just recently switched from savings to checking after a hiatus of 2 years (closed checking account & just had savings). I reopened my checking account because the fees ($12 per month) were cheaper than the over withdrawal limit fee on my savings account. So far they have been very helpful, when I forgot my PIN, it took less than 5 minutes to get it reset.","1632":"Every month my paycheck from work gets direct deposited into my checking account here. It never hits at midnight, and when I call to ask why, the customer service representative tried to convince me that my job hadn't sent it to the bank yet, despite my job emailing me after it had been sent. I don't pay a monthly fee though since my check gets direct deposited every month. Overall, the account is a great basic checking account. My biggest dislike is that my paychecks are never processed at midnight like other banks.","1635":"We got a BOA travel card for an upcoming trip to Europe. The primary reason for doing so was that we wanted to avoid international transaction fees. It worked will in Europe, in several of the EU countries. We also like that it has numerous cash-back offers that we take advantage of, in addition to the point reward system. We have gotten several dollars back that way and it is a pretty good deal as far as credit card rewards go. We have not had a problem with fraud with this card. An international traveler looking for a good card from a strong bank would make a good choice to go with this card.","1634":"I have stuck with Bank of America because they were the first ones too give me a chance when I was still in high school and gave me my first checking card. I have had minor problem and the only one was when I called customer support for a confusing charge the lady barley spoke English well but we managed to resolve it. Besides that every issue has been resolved, I hope they gain the good reputation they had before but overall they are very trustworthy.","1636":"I have been banking with Bank of America for over twenty years now. The only complaint I really have is concerning the overdraft fees. I know that I did enroll into the bank's overdraft protection program to save me from them. I can tell that I have really seen that option benefit me. Another reason I stay at this bank is because it is in walking distance from where I live and the tellers are wonderful.","1400":"I've used Bank of America exclusively for a number of years. What I like about it is how available its locations and ATMs are. Even in remote areas you can still access a bank\/ATM. They have e-banking and paper bills as well which is convenient and good for tax\/accounting purposes. The overdraft system is pretty good. They charge you every time you go over but they do allow quite a few purchases over the limit you have. I recommend overdraft protection if you're the kind of person who aimlessly card slides. What I don't like is that the interest you earn is pretty negligible. You might as well not even be earning any for the low conversion rate. It also has a ton of fees which almost come off as them scraping the bottom of the barrel any way they can to get funds out of customers. It's really sheisty and I'm kind of over it.","1637":"I opened this account rather last minute. I was getting ready to close on my house on the day I opened the account. The bank I was using was an online only bank and the mortgage company wouldn't approve it. So I searched around in a panic, looking for a bank. Bank of America has the best hours, the most locations and ATMs for my area, and amazing customer service. When I went in and explained my situations, they went out of their way to get my account opened, immediately transferred the monies from my other account, and made it available immediately (which is VERY uncommon). She new all the tricks to get my account open smoothly and quickly, with no wait time at all. She even went out of her way to fax the new bank info to the mortgage company for me and waited well past the bank's closing time to make sure the mortgage company didn't need anything else. Needless to say, I was able to close on my house that day, thanks to Bank of America. They were true life savers!!","1638":"Bank of America has been mostly great. Their overdraft fees often cause me problems, but the branch is close to my house and the staff are always good-natured. I like that you can get your picture on your debit card, and my family has always been able to deposit money into my local branch when I am away. I have had no real problems with Bank of America though some of their corporate practices make me uncomfortable.","1639":"I prefer Bank of America Savings over their checking account. I don't really dip into my savings account so the interest earned is a lot more noticeable even though the rate is still fairly low. I have it linked to my checking account and I'm enrolled in the Keep The Change program which is a cool way to just edge a little bit more into your savings. It's a really cool way to add to your savings even if you never really bother to save your money. You save either way with this program and I especially like it because it feels like a bonus to what I already in. The monthly fees are pretty low, which is great. There's not much that I don't like about the savings account. Other banks definitely have better offers and higher interest rates but I'm pretty satisfied at Bank of America.","1401":"I had this bank account for several years and normally did not have any problems. My problems arose when I tried to close my account, go figure. I closed the account and they were still sending me statements for 3-4 months that showed zero balance, I called them and they said its standard and basically blew me off.","1402":"After a trip planned through Travel rewards and consequently having numerous issues with our hotel that was booked, we have been promised a full refund for our hotel stay. Not so easy, according to Bank of America travel dept. We have now waited more than 40 days to see a refund posted to our account, even collecting emails from supervisors saying \"it will be 7-10 business days\" Well, we are waaay past that and I would issue a warning to anyone considering using them. It DOES NOT take 40+ days to issue a refund. Wondering if they will be paying the interest that is accruing also!! Our ML investment people talked us into getting this card. Somehow feel really taken on this whole thing\u2026.","1403":"Horrible credit card! I haven't tried to use the points yet but according to the reviews it won't be easy. I've had a bad expirence just trying to make payments on my credit card - I have to jump through hoops every month I try to make payments?!?! Apprently I didn't verify my account in time so now they lock me out every month and want me to print out a form with my full account & routing number on it to mail in (doesn't seem secure?). Everytime I call I am on hold for at least 10 min. All I want to do is login and make a payment like I do with all my other credit cards, is that too much to ask? They were even willing to lose me as a card holder becuase I refused to mail in my account & routing number - wow!","1404":"Their rates are affordable and not to mention the service is 100% personable. 100% Guaranteedcustomer experience, like interest rates, fees and credit limits, which are highly correlated to your income and credit worthiness is up to par and guaranteed and fully able to take on any services that may be interested in","1405":"I have used Bank of America for almost 10 years and while it has been convenient in that there are many ATMs all over the U.S., I have not appreciated their various fees and requirements for the accounts. Also, the overdraft fee is kind of high but thankfully I have had it removed when I go into the branch. The people I have worked with have been very nice but I definitely prefer a local credit union over a big bank.","1408":"This checking account is fine for basic checking. The interest checking would be nice but why keep that kind of balance level when the rates are pitiful? The most irritating issue with this account is the ATM fees. I love Bank of America's services in general as I have many different accounts with them but it feels like the ATM fees are painful if you withdrawal from a non-BOA ATM. Unless you are in a big city, there are not BOA branches or ATMs on every corner. It would be nice if BOA either reduced or eliminated the ATM fees for some or all of their checking accounts.","1407":"I've been a loyal BOA customer for a few years now after switching from Chase. I do like the account, which waives my monthly fees with a direct deposit linked to my account, however, I have some issues with the way the bank processes daily withdrawals and credits.I have been charged a couple of times for over limit fees, which I do not feel were rightfully charged. BOA chooses to process debits, then credits to each account, in that order. Meaning, if you deposit money to cover a charge when your balance is close to 0 (to post on the same day as the debit), you will definitely get charged an over limit fee, because they charge the debit, you go below 0, then they apply the credit to your account, then they take out their fee.I have talked to a couple of CSRs about this issue and no one is helpful.","1406":"I have had a savings account with BOA for a few years now. I find it easy to have this account, as there are locations all over the US - I can deposit with a teller, and also at an ATM - I can withdraw from the same locations. Also, the mobile app allows me to transfer funds to and from my savings and other accounts. They do limit me to three total transfers per month, so I keep a close eye on my amount of transfers so that they don't charge me a fee. Overall, I am satisfied with the savings account.","1409":"As a savings account only you'll be better off with Capital One, or Barclay. They pay at 7 to 10x better than Bank Of America's money market accounts. (Either way savings accounts aren't making any real money lately)With that said though combined with their cash rewards card 10% reward boost when deposited in savings, and bankamerideals, you can make around $300 to $500 in profits with this account in a year. Just place $300 in savings and use it as an awards saving net, and move the profits into a real savings account, or extra payment into an IRA.","181":"I had a Bank of America checking account, about seven years ago, prior to my current checking and bank that I love. I had noticed over the years that Band of America would que up my debit card transactions and process them in batches. They would show as pending for sometimes up to a week long. I never really thought about why they did it until I found out the hard way one day. One Thursday night before payday, I inadvertently used my debit card one too many times and I did overdraw thinking it would be in pending for days. NO, BOA decided to clear that transaction in lightening speed and proceeded to process the rest of the transactions as well in an order that created the most overdraw fees possible for them. If they would have processed all transactions in order then I would have only one overdraft fee, but in the order they processed the transactions it caused an onslaught of overdraft fees. As each fee ate up more available money which caused another transaction to bounce. Rinse and repeat. Needless to say it wrecked that paycheck and they lost a customer for life.","180":"I opened this savings account about five months ago because I was interested in the higher interest rates, a significant amount higher than a regular savings account. I set up an automatic transfer every week to two weeks but because my balance wasn't high enough I was charged $12 a month to keep the account open. I believe this is a great account if you have enough funds in it to keep the fees down but the interest was not making anywhere near the $12 a month so I had to close the account down because it continued to cost me money.","183":"The introductory offers on this card are spectacular for anyone who like to travel. It's not difficult to meet the cards requirement within the first month and if you do you pretty much already have a paid plane ticket to California! I like this card for its low fees and its great rewards and it also is a very safe card to use with it's smartchip. It's similar to a Capitol One Venture Card in that way that it makes traveling much easier and spending much funner but the rewards with Capitol One are hard to beat. Definitely recommend this BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card to anyone who's budget it fits in.","182":"I'm a student at the University of Connecticut and signed up to bank with Bank of America Core Checking. Seemed like a great deal, especially with the monthly fee being waived since I am a student. Turned out this wasn't so though as I got charged the fee and it over drafted my account and charged me another fee for over drafting! It was absolutely ridiculous but luckily with a few calls I was able to sort things out, great customer service, they really listen to you.","184":"This is the worst credit card I've ever had. I was offered the 15,000 bonus miles for the card after making my first purchase. It's been 3 months since I did so, and I have not been able to receive the bonus miles. I've called both Bank of America and Spirit (8+ times between the two of them). You cannot get a Spirit representative on the phone without pretending to book a flight (the entire customer service center is automated except for that). When I spoke to a representative, they indicated I needed to go through their website. I've done that 3 times now and they do not help me, just give me a standard answer which is unrelated. STAY AWAY from this card - Spirit has lied about this promotion and refuses to even speak to me, leaving me with no recourse.There's no point in 2x miles on every dollar when they're so difficult to work with.Additionally, your miles expire if you don't make a purchase Every Single Month.","186":"My husband and I had an account with Bank of America and when he left for the military there was a computer error causing us to be in the negative for a fraction of a second (they checked) but it still caused us to have an overdraft fee. I wasn't on as a joint account holder at the time because he left suddenly so they had to have him call in to have them reverse the fee. Meanwhile he can't call for a couple months so these fees keeping adding up every day and when he returned and explained he was military and unable to call in and could even provide proof they said too bad. He was forced to either pay all those fees for a small computer error or close his account. Needless to say, we will never bank with them again or recommend anyone to bank with them. The error was a transaction for 16$ that was taken out twice, then one was put back all within a fraction of a second but it was enough to put us in the negative and accrue fees.","187":"I have been with BOA for many years, I love my savings account, I can move money to and from with ease, I can see how much I have and where it is, There are no hidden fees, Charges or surprises, There are several options to choose from for savings, All of them can be explained in detail either on the website or in person at a branch.The mobile app is wonderful to use and I can do everything i need to online or on my phone, I have savings accounts set up One for regular savings, Two for my children, and one for Vacations, I love that I can transfer from checking to savings instantly from my phone or computer. I will never go with another bank as long as BOA is around!!!","185":"I was with bank of america a few years ago and after dealing with the monthly fees I was near the end of my ropes. The straw that broke the camels back is when I found out they were going to be initiating a charge for every time you used your debit card. I think they eventually rejected that idea once the bad press came out, but just knowing they were considering it was enough for me to leave them and head to a credit union. I haven't looked back since.","189":"I absolutely love Bank of America. I love the fact that I do not have extra fees if my account is overdrawn while a still have a few bucks in my account. This has been a lifesaver on many different occasions. I also love the fact that I can get a large sum of money at the ATM. Other banking institutions have a much lower withdrawal amount. Overall I am really pleased with Bank of America and see myself having accounts with them for a long time.","188":"I think that the AAA Member Rewards Credit Card is a great choice for AAA members it has a lot of benefits and protection options from overdraft protection to shopping protection. I also like that there are no annual fees which in turn can help save you a lot of money,and the cash reward bonus is a great idea while in turn with the cash back. The only thing I did not like in my opinion is the balance transfer fee because it charges you 3% of whatever you are transferring, and the max penalty APR is kind of high.","1290":"This is by far the worst credit card I own. Their interest rates suck, and so does their customer service. The Discover It card is better on so many levels.","1291":"This card is a joke nobody knows what there doing at customer service and it's been over a year andon't they are holding my money I'm very upset with this card at the end of this month I'm DONE","1293":"If you fashion yourself to be a world traveler, this is definitely the card for you. $500 purchases in the first 90 days is incredibly easy - that's basically groceries and gas for a family of four, then you automatically get a $100 credit for traveling. Hello, Florida! The best part is that the points don't expire. Out of all the cards I've used for traveling, I've never seen this. Everyone knows points expire - but these don't. They're like miracle points. You can also use the points not only for flights, but for rental cars, hotels (and some really cool hotels, I might add.) Great card if you're looking to rack up travel points - I would definitely recommend.","1292":"I have been using Bank of America for both my personal and Business banking needs for many years. There's a number of things I appreciate about their service. First off, they have a full range of products that they can offer. Whether it be checking, savings, credit cards, lending, online banking, mobile banking, etc. they have everything.I have also been impressed with how well all of their products work in tandem. It's important for me to be able to move money around between and among various personal and business accounts, deposit checks with my mobile phone app, easily send money to vendors or pay bills.Finally, while they are a massive bank and organization, I still get great service at my local branch. I go to them whenever I need something or I am not comfortable calling their service center, and I have never had a problem.","1295":"I had a few accounts with BOA for quite some time. I had some issues with my debit card and needed to order a card. My debit card had fraud and i wasn't aware it was happening. I never used my card and next thing you know i this going on.","1294":"I have had a great experience using Bank of America. I have had a checking account with them for over 10 years and they have been great. The only issue I've ever had is that I didn't realize that if you don't have direct deposits going into your account regularly, you have to pay a small monthly service charge. I had never run up against this until I quit my job and became self employed. I can't really blame that on Bank of America too much though because it's likely they told me and I just forgot. Overall though, I have been extremely happy with Bank of America and the fact that there are branches all over the US and that they coordinate with the Bank of Nova Scotia in Canada makes them super convenient to use.","1297":"I've had Bank of America checking for at least 12 years. I have had bad experiences in the past with the way they were racking up fees based on how the debits were ordered. However, for the last 5 years, I have been extremely happy with their products and services. We now have checking, savings, two credit cards and our mortgage with them.","1296":"I have this checking account for 3 years already. I am satisfied with it.I opened it because I wanted to apply to their credit card. The assistant recommended me this checking account. As I said, I am satisfied with this choice. However, I like not paying monthly fee, but it can be difficult to maintain $1500 on my account. $1000 will be MUCH better.I like the email alerts and their app. I had no serious problems with this checking account so far.","1298":"I recently decided to pay down my balance on my Platinum Bank of America Visa credit card that I've had since 2007. My available credit line was $3,500 and I had carried a balance on it for years that I was slowly paying off. I decided to make a $1,500 payment reducing what was owed on the card down to less than $800.Guess what happened?The very next day Bank of America did a \"Periodic review of my credit\" and decided to reduce my credit line down to $800!!! What's worse is they didn't even notify me!When I questioned it customer service and the supervisor said that my credit wasn't good enough for the credit line I had. But I have the best credit I've had in years! They spun lines of BS and tried to tell me that the \"periodic review\" had nothing to do with me paying my card down and that they had no intention of fixing the issue, ever.So what's really happening?Bank of America is doing something known as \"chasing the balance\" in order to increase their profits. Now if I don't make a large enough payment I'll be over my credit line and be subject to fees.If I make to big of a payment they'll reduce my credit line even further!If you want to be able to use your credit card and pay off the balance eventually, stay away from Bank of America!-Unethical Business Practices.-Lying Customer Service Center-Terrible Treatment of Long Term CustomersBEWARE: Stay clear of Bank of America Credit Cards!","1299":"This is a pretty sweet card if you're an AAA member. It has a lot going on for it. Top of which is 2 points per $1 for gas, grocery and drug store purchases and 3 points per $1 on all qualifying AAA and travel purchases which will really rack up the points as you use this card. Plus you can get points for other purchases to. Add this to rewards relating to car services or repair and you can save a pretty good amount of money over time.The terms are good as well and the AAA Member Rewards Credit Card has a good interest rate. It's really the rewards that set this card apart. Like the Capital One card I also have right now doesn't offer any rewards and just can't compare to this one.","2190":"I used to use a regional bank until I happened to move. I signed up for a Bank of America checking account and savings account as the nearest branch was right down the road. They have been really forgiving with overdraft fees even if it was my fault. I tried to stop-payment on a check and it was done quickly although I think the fee is a little bit high. Customer service is alright but they have a slightly complicated phone system and it isn't simple to get help with what you are looking for.","2191":"I have been with Bofa for many years, but just recently had my account switch to the core checking, from the student. It basically the same thing besides the charge, which isn't really that bad at $12 per month. One thing that I wish that they could be better about is posting things on the same day which you deposit them. I have deposited money after work and been charged an overdraft fee because the money I had deposited the night before actually wasn't available until the next day. Sometimes its not available until monday which really sucks if you make a deposit late friday night. I feel like most people get paid on fridays and some work later then others. I think that they should extend it,especially since its all done by ATMs and computers anyways.","2192":"This card presents a number of benefits on specific purchases that add up to savings in the long run.  Currently, I use my Chase Freedom and it does not provided as high of a percentage of Cash Back for food and gas.  Aside from the Cash Back benefit, the percentage rate is a tad bit lower than my Chase Freedom card.  I appreciate the idea of receiving cash back as opposed to just rewards points that you have to use to purchase something you might not need in the long run.","2193":"I was generally pleased with Bank of America for several years. I had no complaints until I received in the mail a claim form for a lawsuit that was filed against BofA for unfairly charging customers overdraft fees. I went over my statements for the previous 2 years and found out that indeed I was one of those customers who was treated despicably. The bank would not post any transactions on the weekend and would show them as pending. When Monday came the pending transactions posted but they would take the highest debit, regardless of the time of the transaction, and apply that to the account first. Then the next highest and so on. The affect this had was that the largest transactions would overdraw the account and the smaller debits would each incur an overdraft fee. They did this solely to take advantage of their customers instead of posting transaction in the order in which they were made.","3409":"Grade School Savings In 1960 What happens to the money you put in a savings acct. Back in the 1960 when I was in grade school and we never pulled it out.","2194":"I opened a Bank of America Interest Checking Account. There is no minimum to open, but the monthly fee is pretty high, and the minimum balance to avoid the monthly fee is $10,000 which I like most people could not keep in my account. The overdraft fee is kind of high too. The customer service was really good though. The people I talked to were kind and helpful.","2195":"If Wells Fargo wasn't my primary bank and it was easier, I'd switch to Bank of America in a heartbeat. Their savings account has been wonderful! I love how easy it is to do everything online and their requirements for opening a savings account are pretty low in my opinion. Everything is clearly disclosed and there are NO surprises. If there are any problems, you can talk to someone online, in person, or on the phone. I definitely recommend opening a savings account with Bank of America. It's so easy and simple to use. And the best part is there is absolutely no headache.","2196":"I have been a member of BOA for about 3 years now. I have a savings account and a mortgage with them. They are very friendly, and their loan originators are very knowledgeable. They keep in contact with you and help you each step of the way when it comes to getting a loan. I even was given the opportunity to lower my rate by paying off my original loan with a home equity loan at a stunning 3% with no closing costs. I have saved a great deal of time and stress by having been a member of this bank. The tellers are very nice and can easily process any need that I have.","2197":"I have had this account for several years. The monthly fee is not a problem as long as you work in a decent job that does direct deposit into your account, so most people should be able to avoid that. I love the email alerts that warn you of low account balances and other issues. The customer service is always extremely helpful and  efficient whenever I call in with a question or concern. Furthermore, the mobile app is extremely useful for making check deposits and transfers. I would highly recommend this account.","3410":"Bank of America Review I have been a customer of this bank for over six years now, and have had a generally positive experience. Interest rates for savings accounts are so low that I hold all money in my checking account. They have provided me a good way to gradually increase my credit rating, while providing me with a basic rewards program that has earned me extra cash for school. The online interface is very user friendly and makes it easy to check account balances and pay bills.","2199":"I wish I could give this bank no stars! I opened up a savings account because most of my banks were online. At the time I was doing waitress work for extra money so I wanted to deposit my tips immediately into a bank. I chose Bank of America because I was young and they had Hello Kitty bank cards. Choosing Bank of America was a HUGE mistake. There were so many hidden fees associated with the account by the time I received my first monthly statement I didn't have any money left in my account. Be careful of minimum deposit fees, ATM withdraw fees (even if it is a Bank of America ATM), and over the limit withdraw fees. When I tried to go into the bank and call customer service they were rude. My issue was not a concern in their eyes. I will never bank with Bank of America again in my life.","2198":"I've had this account for many years, so I'm not that interested in changing it. It has it's ups and downs - the monthly service fee is pretty high. But they have a great app, and were one of the first banks with online bill pay. They email me when my balance drops below a certain point and they have other email alerts you can set up. Based on my experience with other banks and credit unions, they are no better or worse than any other.","3411":"Can't imagine a better bank! I never knew the importance of great customer service at my local bank until I lost my wallet while on a trip abroad. I was a complete nervous wreck, but thanks to the amazing customer service representative at my local Bank of America, I was finally breathe and solve the problem of my missing debit card. The whole process of getting a new debit card and PIN number took about half an hour, and I was reassured that nothing had been stolen. The associate who helped me was amazing and very professional, and she didn't give off the vibe that she just wanted to sell me a credit card. In fact, in all my years of Bank of America's service, I've never once felt like they just want to sell me a credit card!","1200":"This is a great card to have. I love the point system and how you can earn 2 points when you use it for gas, groceries, or prescriptions. Your points will add up fast when you go on a trip (if it's a qualified AAA purchase.) The card I use now is Discover, and I only receive 1% cash back on my purchases, no matter what I'm buying. The AAA Member Rewards card looks like a great option for me.","3412":"Bad Credit Card Department They pull hard credit inquiry on existing credit card accounts this is unheard of by other big banks andif you do not use the credit for one year they will close the account without your knowledge...","1201":"I really like this card. The BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card is a great way to build your credit and make a reasonable deal of your purchases back via the rewards system. 1% on every purchase, 2% on groceries, and 3% on gas! This might not sound like a big deal but it really adds up over time, especially if you're diligent about keeping your balance paid off. Combine that with a very competitive interest rate and you have an all-around solid card.Compare to other reward cards which might offer reward points but not automatic money back on purchases, gas, and groceries. You really can't beat this card.","1202":"Bank of america allowed me to make a profile and use my first deposit to pay for the account charges. This enabled me to make a account without putting any cash on it the using my first deposit as payment for the account charge. When I had to dispute a transaction with another financial institute and my bank. It failed but what happened was that I put the wrong info upon fixing said info the transaction went through now I make deposits no problem.","3413":"Bank of America Savings & Checking I owned a savings and checking account from BoA for about seven years, for the most part my experience has been generally good. Both of their standard savings and student checking account are flexible. The fee for withdrawing from the saving account outside the grace period is forgiving. Similar to the overdrawing from a core checking account, they give you a reasonable amount of time before charging the overdrawn fee. Their rates could be a lot more competitive though. Same with the benefits, the cashback rewards are lackluster. However my experience with customer service has been surprisingly positive for all encounters. The representatives are courteous and helpful, cooperate to answer questions and request . Haven't had a bad experience yet. Although I wish they had better rates and rewards for their checking accounts, my experience with Bank of America has been positive and content.","3414":"Our Systems Are Down... Went in this morning to open a checking account. I was told their systems were down but they could do the application by hand. Of course that took way longer than an electronic application. At the end, I was told that they couldn't process my deposit but I would be \"invited\" back when the system is back up.","1204":"I chose bank of america for its low interest rates and found myself to be pretty pleased with this company. Although the application process was a pain and could have been more efficient, I find that my savings account has worked very well for me regardless. The customer service is excellent as well- I have never been disappointed with bank of america in that regard. If I walk into a store or even call them, I feel valued and don't feel like another annoying phone call. I have been able to save money and not dish out all my savings to some company which is great. I feel that I can keep transferring from my checking into savings without having to worry about anything. I would recommend bank of america to anyone looking for a savings bank.","1203":"For some reason Bank of America always gets a bad rap but I guess that's for people who have tons and tons of money or something. I've had my bank account since 2009 and haven't had any major problems at all. The only service fee I ever get is on my savings account and that is $5 a month. I find their mobile and online banking to be really convenient and I use the mobile app almost every single day to keep track of purchases and make transfers. One time someone tried using my debit card in Texas fraudulently and Bank of America contacted me right away, shut my card off, and then resolved everything within minutes of it all happening. That's something I really appreciate. I also love their free ATM services and that there are locations all over the place and on every corner. I've never had to use an ATM that charges me an arm and a leg in this town because of that. The only thing I could say is that their processing times could be quicker because sometimes I think I have more money then I actually do because things take so long to process.","3415":"High Cost\/High Function I have had an account with BoA for the better part of the decade. I first opened it as a college student because of the convenience of having locations both in the city I was currently living in as well as my home state. As a college checking account it offered just about anything you would need as far as services and web\/app capabilities. They were also pretty good about waiving the occasional overdraft fee when needed. But since I was converted to a regular checking account it has been near impossible to avoid fee's. $10 \"Overdraft Protection\" fee if my checking runs out and money is need to be pulled from my savings account. Another $3 to transfer money to MY account at another bank. And my interactions with customer service have been less then acceptable, both within branches and over the phone. To be honest the only reason I haven't switched to a local credit union is the mere fact that I am too lazy to change all my auto drafts. I'm guessing that will soon change.","3416":"Bank of American meets my needs as a consumer I have been with Bank of America since for at least 10 years now and have had a pleasant experience. The online banking system more than meets my needs and I have just discovered the usefulness of the BoA app. I can scan a check and deposit it right from my phone. This feature saves me a lot of time. I have always had great customer service when contacting Bank of America and have been very pleased with their services, rates, and fees. I will continue using BoA for all my banking needs.","1209":"Wow! If you are big traveler the BankAmericard Travel Rewards Card is perfect for you. This card has amazing bonuses with fairly low spending requirements to meet get those rewards. Also, the 0% introductory for 12 months offer is amazing. Using the bonus points for flights, hotels, car rentals, and tons more is a great offer. All of this matched with the fairly low interest rate and the annual 10% bonus makes this card a must have.","1208":"I opened my BOA account when I went to college because it was one of the banks close to my college campus. I really enjoyed that I didn't have to pay any fees to maintain my account while I was a student. However, now that I am over the age of 23, I have to pay a fee of $12 unless I maintain a certain balance or a specific amount of direct deposit. While this is not an issue because I typically meet both requirements, it can be a hassle to make sure that both are met so I don't have to pay the fee. Other than that, I have no complaints. They are a very good bank with great customer service who are always willing to help!","1207":"I transferred my checking to Bank of America after a horrendous experience at Charter one. I could not be happier with my BOA account. I set it up with my direct deposit, so I don't have a monthly fee to maintain and the best part is that if i ever overdraft it simply takes the money out of my savings. The only thing I don't understand is that most of the time there isn't a fee for this, but every now and then I see a $10 charge. Besides that, I love that I can deposit checks using my phone. The app is fantastic. Transferring funds between my accounts or to other people is also a breeze.When the data breach happened at Home Depot, they sent me an email stating they were sending me a new debit card They do all the work of being sure that anything suspicious on my account, they look into it. The first time they froze my account, I was irritated but knowing why they did it, I now have peace of mind that they are watching out for my money. They will call and email you so you know there is a hold due to some suspicious activity.So, I love my account and won't be going anywhere any time soon!","1206":"I opened this savings account over their regular one since the interest was higher. I simply auto transfer money monthly from my checking into my savings. Transferring money is a breeze. Since I already have my checking at Bank of a America, I can manually do it through the website or through the app. I have to say, i really do love the app and how easy it is to check my account. I get emails to remind me when my statements are made available. You can set up various alerts to let you know if you get a deposit, withdrawal, balance falls below a certain limit. You can really set up an alert for most anything!I initially was unaware there was a fee with this account unless I tied it to my checking or maintained a balance so seeing that monthly fee pop up was shocking. I simply tied it to my checking so I don't have to worry about the fees anymore.Interest rates are what are at this point at 3% you can't beat it. It's better than the 1% so I'll take the 3%.","1205":"I had a Bank of America checking account for a long time in my youth, and I absolutely hated their business practices. As a young person sometimes you wouldn't realize how much you were spending and they will quickly give you overdraft fees of $35 for being $1 in the red. Even if you try to fix it the next day when you realize it. And a monthly fee for a checking account these days? Seriously, there are too many banks that would love your business and not charge that!","1351":"Bank of America is a great bank. I had been using Chase for years, but started to get tired of all these new fees they kept charging. I was paying almost $100\/month in various \"fees\" with Chase, and no matter how many times I called to have this rectified, they absolutely refused to fix it. So we switched to Bank of America and haven't looked back. There's BofA ATM's everywhere, so pulling cash out of an ATM is hassle free. Most of their branches (of which there are many) have 4 or 5 ATM's instead of 1 or 2 like most banks, so no waiting in a long line! Checking is actually *free* if you have Direct Deposit. No tricky hidden fees! I have had some various issues that weren't clear when I opened the account, but after talking with customer service, I found them in the agreement I signed but failed to completely read. Still, great company.","3417":"Very satisfied customer We open our accout in Bank of America three years ago. We were customers of other banks. But since we have being using this bank, we have never had any problems. The time when we went to the bank to open an account, the person who took care of us was very helpfull and nice, to point that we haven't had any need to go back or call for information. Even when we went abroad, and in some store, they charged us three times the same amount, the Bank locked our account, as a measure of security. We liked that. And when we called the Bank, because our card was blocked, they were very helpfull giving us assitance. We like their on line programs too, very easy to access and to use. So We really feel very satisfied with this Bank. No need for another bank","1350":"I've had this account for a couple years now and so far have been pleased. It's low cost, but it gets the job done for what I need. I do most of my banking online and the BoA UI is easy to use. Additionally, I was overdrafted twice (my fault, gotta pay attention to those monthly autobill charges) and their rep was able to reduce my penalties. Overall I would strongly recommend the account.","3418":"Decent Customer service has always been nice and friendly but my problem are the hidden fees. Even if you are explained them It's aggravating like I can't go inside to make a deposit without them charging me. The mobile app is amazing to have! you can even deposit your checks on there but in my experience personal checks are a bit harder to get through on there.","1355":"This card has some great features such as the money back on gas and food purchases. These type purchases can add up pretty quickly earning the user a decent reward just for its use. I also like the cash bonus which is a nice incentive, however, my major concern with using this card is the high cash advance fee, I just do not understand it. If you are borrowing from your own account and will be repaying why is the fee so high?","1354":"It goes without saying that the AAA Member Rewards Credit Card is the best deal for AAA members. You earn 3 points per $1 on AAA and travel purchases which is a very nice perk if you travel a lot. You earn 1 point per dollar spent elsewhere which isn't that exciting.The APR ranges from 12.99% - 22.99% which goes from decent\/good to never carry a balance land. There is no annual fee which is a big plus. A lot of rewards cards have crazy annual fees which can sneak up on you.For comparison sake, I also looked at the Citi ThankYou Preferred Card. That card also has no annual fee and the APR rate range is the same. It offers 2 ThankYou Points per dollar spent on dining at restaurants and entertainment and 1 point per dollar on all other purchases. They also offer 20,000 bonus if you spend $1500 in the first three months which is worth $200 and 0% intro APR on purchases and transfers for 12 months. If you are a big spender this card may be a better fit.For AAA members who like a simple rewards system the AAA Member Rewards Credit Card is a good deal.","1353":"I was at first very skeptical if I would get approved because my credit is not stellar but now that I have been I am ecstatic. This card is awesome, I love that the rewards don't expire for five whole years, so that I can watch them accumulate and feel great about it. I previously had the standard BOA cash rewards card, and was amazed to find that this one offers 25% more cash rewards, which is awesome. Love this card.","1352":"I have been a Bank of American customer for almost ten years. It was the first checking (and savings) account I ever opened on my own. It was very easy to open the account initially, especially given that I was 16 years old and enrolled in a student checking account with no fees. Over time, however, I experienced monthly fees, to the tune of $12 per month. These fees were only removed if I enrolled in direct deposit AND set up a monthly deposit from my checking to my savings. I feel these fees are not warranted AT ALL.","1358":"I used Bank of America for a checking account in the past and It's the reason I switched to credit unions. They don't care about the individual customer. They will charge you for every little thing they can. Things most banks give for free like checks and things like that. BoA will charge you for. Of course they have the monthly maintenance fees, and bad ATM fees which don't get reimbursed. There's no reason to be with Bank of America any longer. In my opinion, there are so many better banks out there.","1356":"Although most checking accounts have minimum balance and fees for all sort of things Bank of America has the highest of them all.. I have been charged from $25-$75 for not maintaining minimum balance for a day or if direct deposit setup by my company came a few days late.. Other banks usually listen to genuine delays and will reverse the charges but Bank of America never does that.. In fact they will charge a penalty and then the balance will go below minimum threshold and they will put another penalty on that... May be it is just my branch associate (Houston TX) but they never reverse the charges.. I am closing my account with them and moving to chase.. I will also recommend looking into capital one 360 checking account which is all online and doesnt require minimum balance...","1357":"i am using Bank of America from last 2 years, i feel its the one of the best Bank of USA b\/c worldwide this bank given the business.i am using both type of account i mean Checking & Saving Account , I am felt that the Bank of americas customer service is horrible. So I eventually moved my funds to a credit union and I really couldn't be happier. No more fees and random problems. The savings account wasn't bad, except for the fees that is. But I really didn't want to have to deal with bank of americas horrible customer service. So I didn't bother staying with them.\u2026","1359":"Bank of america has been a pain in my side. They charged me monthly fees, they have limits on everything. Poor customer support. Just all around a bad bank to do business with. Unfortunately, this was my first bank and I had no experience with anything else. Once I told a friend about my experiences with Bank of america, they recommended a better bank and I moved on. In this day and age, monthly maintenance fees and hidden charges are a thing of the past. These big banks need to catch up.","1380":"This is Bank America credit card is a pretty good card. I had pretty good credit when I applied so I have in the lower range for my APR which is one of my biggest concerns when I choose a credit card. I also really like the introductory rate of zero percent for the first fifteen months. It comes with overdraft protection, I have never used so that does not really matter to me. All banks seemed to have raised their late fees up and this one is no exception to that. The twenty five day grace period is nice but the cash advance feel is steep and the APR for cash advance is almost twenty five percent. It does have a smart chip and online banking as all banks should these days and all in all, it is a decent card I have had no problems with.","1381":"Wow, the BankAmericard Travel Rewards card offers a lot of points as well as reasonable interest rates. For anyone who travels a lot, this card would a smart decision. Not only does it offer 1.5 points for every dollar spent (my current card only offers 1), it gives you 3 points for every dollar spent on travel. With the price of airfare being what it is today, those points will add up quick! Add that to the $100 dollar bonus you get for signing up, and this card is definitely a winner.","3419":"Worst Bank Ever This bank is by far the worst big bank I have EVER done business. They are so money hungry they charge you for every little unreasonable thing, and I'm not just talking about OD fees (I opted out of those and use my account wisely). If you are an unhappy customer, they dont care about anything you have to say. They'll just close your account and not even ask why you're unhappy. ONLY ONE EXAMPLE: I had missed two CC payments on ANOTHER CC UNRELATED to BOA (while I made sure to make BOA CC payments on time and more than minimum) and the CC department decided to take the liberty and lower my CC limit based on the two other late payments. WTH??? If I'm current with you and you are getting what is owed to YOU, what difference does it make? When I went in to close both my bank account and my credit card (like I needed the extra \"burden\" of another card) they didn't even bother to ask me why I wanted to close my account to try to keep my business. Maybe had they done so, it would have calmed me down and I would have stayed with them. The fact that they did not do so just goes to show that they have poor customer service and dont care a bit about the customer. My payment history on ALL of my cards, bills and payment schedules are all current, on time and never late, so the ONE time I was having financial problems with ANOTHER institution (nothing to do with BOA) they decided to cut my limit. I have plenty of \"good credit\" cards that I didnt need another one...the only reason I got this one was because it was a promo offer and for a separate business account that I hadn't used for business in awhile anyway, so it's not like it hurt me one bit to close that account. They only stabbed themselves in the foot and now will not see another hard, earned penny of mine go into their institution. My advice? Shop around. There are plenty of other big banks that would love your business and make sure you are happy (within reason) before closing a perfectly fine account. The problem with BOA is that ALL customer request seem to not be \"within reason\".","1388":"For a savings account Bank of America doesn't really offer much. I had heard bad things about bank of americas customer service, but I never had to deal with them personally. My main issue with this account is that, it is basically like any other savings account, except they charge ridiculous fees on top of it. I signed up with them off of brand name alone which was a big mistake. Once I realized just how much they charge you just to store your money there, I closed the account and moved the money to a free savings account. The fees are just too much and are completely unnecessary.","1384":"I have had serious problems with overdraft charges in the past. Before the Obama administration changed the rules, I had several situations where an unexpected charge would come in and cause a cascade of overdraft charges. For example, I recall having a Starbucks charge for 2 dollars and something else came in and created an overdraft of less than a dollar. All the other postings for that day then were also overdrafts . And each overdraft created a fee of 35 dollars! I am on a limited retirement income, so these occasions were total disasters. I've forgotten now how the rules have changed, but since they did, I have not had this situation arise again. On the rare occasion when I have had a single overdraft fee, the customer service people have been wonderful in reversing it.","1382":"I love my BofA checking account. There is no monthly fee if you have your paycheck automatically direct deposited into your account. I have been a customer with them for years, and have never been disappointed. The mobile app is very useful for depositing checks, checking balances, paying bills, etc. They do not charge for bill pay, which is nice. My only complaint is that occasionally in the past, they post transactions in an odd order, so I've been hit with an overdraft fee when I really shouldn't have. But they will sometimes waive it, if your argument is compelling enough. Other than that, I love this account!","1383":"I've had a Bank of America checking account since 2006 because it was convenient for college and had no fees. Except that I don't really want to find a new bank I have no reason to stay with Bank of America. Their locations are convenient but their customer service leaves a lot to be desired. They're a huge banking institution and nickle and dime their small customers. ATM card not working? $5.00. No free checks. Nothing for loyal customers, no exceptions. If there were other banks convenient to my home and office I'd leave in a heartbeat.","1387":"I have had Bank of America since Junior year of high school which is now 7 years. I started with a savings account then opened a checking account. The account I have has low interest, and I haven't been able to find another bank with such a competitive rate. I love being able to snap a picture of my check and have it deposited into my checking account without stepping foot in a bank. Awesome feature of their bank. To avoid the fees all you have to do is keep a minimum of $1500 in your account which has never been an issue! I have over drafted 4 times and they waived the fee every time!! So awesome bank overall!","1386":"I have two separate checking accounts with BOA. They are both Core Checking Accounts. One I use for my bills (i.e rent, utilities, car payments, phone, etc.), the other I use for general spending. I have not really come across any problems except for the monthly maintenance fee. I think that $12 is too much for a month. Since I get direct deposit in one of the accounts, the fee is waived, but the other account gets it each month! That is $144 a month which I think is a little high.My Debit card that is linked to my account has also been flagged for \"fraud or suspicious activity\" and been cancelled a few times. I don't mind them monitoring my card, but inform me or call me and ask if its \"suspicious\".","1385":"I have been with Bank of America for about 10 years now. Their savings account is easy to maintain a $300 min. balance. I also get the monthly maintenance fee waived by linking it with my checking accounts. For this I am happy. I also am enrolled in a \"keep the change\" program\", which rounds each of my transactions in my checking account up to a whole number, and transfers the \"loose change\" into my savings account. This helps me inadvertently save money. Although it seems small, I invest a good amount into my savings via the program. I have never been charged a fee in my savings account, and have actually gotten some money back from BOA since they matched some of my Keep the Change money back when I opened the account. Until something goes wrong, I won't be going anywhere.","3420":"Bank Of America I tried out Bank of America for about 1 year. I decided to switch to a credit union. The customer service was great but the fees were too high.","1389":"I love this credit card! I use it almost everyday for my purchases. I make 3% back on gas purchases, 2% back on groceries, and 1% back on everything else. It really is a good way to save extra money just by running my purchases through my credit card and paying off the card before the end of each month.","2082":"The BankAmericard Cash Reward Credit Card is great for points, 1 percent for normal purchases and 2 percent on groceries and gas. Also, getting $100 back just for spending $500 is great, I would have spent that much anyway. The downsides of this card are that the foreign transaction fee is high. 3% is pretty high especially when it is usually free nowadays. Also the late fee is a little steep at $35, people make mistakes and pay late sometimes, and $35 is a huge setback for something so small.","2081":"I like that this card has a consistent reward system. My BankAmericard cash back system offers different points for different purchases, and will change depending on how many you use. The AAA card does not have that issue. Plus along with my AAA membership, this card makes offers towards travel vouchers and I spent a lot of time traveling, so this maybe very useful if you travel a lot. But, with high variable rates, you have to be sure not to keep a balance, as much as possible with this card.","2080":"The BankAmericard Cash Reward Credit Card is an excellent card for earning cash back through daily spending. There is 1 percent back for all purchases, 2 percent on groceries, and 3 percent back on gas purchases. There is also a $100 bonus for spending $500 within the first 90 days, very reasonable. With that being said, I really love the card and the bonuses that are included (they update cash back bonuses regularly), but the reason I gave this card 3 stars is because of the customer service. I recently had my card stolen and I called to cancel the card and was informed that I would have a replacement sent to me in the next 10 business days. It is currently March and I lost my card in the first week of February, I still have not received the card. I called back again to express that I had lost my card and the customer service support line was confused and was not aware that I even called in the first place. I would like a little more communication on the customer support side of the card because I really do love this card!","3421":"The best big bank I've had business with! I've held accounts with many different banks over the years - Wells Fargo, Chase, Community, Bank of Texas, various credit unions... I've had the best experience with Bank of America so far! I've had an account with Bank of America for about a year now and I am very pleased with their customer service, both in my local branch and also over the phone and chat. The last time I had an issue regarding an overdraft fee a few weeks ago, I promptly spoke to an agent through the online chat. The agent was able to resolve my issue and was able to waive the fee for me! For people saying they have bad customer service experience with BOFA (or banks in general), part of it can be the way you approach the issue with the agent. If you start out rude and angry the agent may not feel like helping you to the best of his or her ability. Just a thought!    Anyways, I'm happy with BOFA and I will stay a loyal customer.","2085":"Stay away from this card. Spirit mileage program is very bad. I used it for two years and they cancel your air miles suddenly. If you try to call spirit customer support they will cut throat to say there is nothing you can do get it back or will not explain the reason why they expired the miles. Also you don't earn miles and when you book the travel using these miles they now increased miles for travel and you need lot of mileages. I strongly advise to stay away from this card. This card is not worth it. Choosing 1 star since I cannot rate it 0.","2084":"I love my MBNA card. Have been a member for over 20 years. I have used it multiple times for balance transfer, simply because they would offer me zero percent for an extended period of time. That really adds up to some saving on interest charges. Some of the other cards go nuts with their interest rate. I did take a cash advance on this card as well, it is high interest, but that is to be expected. I do not plan on getting another advance anytime soon. I do however plan to keep this card and to use continue using it for balance transfers when they offer a good rate.","2083":"The BankAmericard Visa Credit Card from Bank of America is a great card to use for daily everyday purchases. It's convenient & easey to use, secure, and it's backed up by Bank of America's great customer support. I have been using this card for over 3 years and never had an issue with it. I pay my bills, groceries, and even go out shopping with it on occasions. It's slick design makes it cool to carry around in your wallet & it's mobile banking feature is excellent. If you're looking for a Visa, this is one that you'll love for years to come.","3422":"Mostly satisfied As far as the services themselves, I love Bank of America. Transfers and deposits happen quickly, and I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m not dissatisfied with the amount of fees when they do happen. I like that their website has a chat function so I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have to call or go into a branch every time I need to talk to someone. If I have to go into a bank branch or get an issue resolved that's unusual, I tend to be a little let down. As polite as they are, they tend to speak with confidence about things they don't know about, and others will be somewhat rude and callous when you come in expecting something based on what you've been told. However, they've refunded a good amount of fees and are generally very reasonable.","2087":"I have been a long time Bank of America customer. I have their core checking plan. I at one time had an unexpected withdraw and my account was overdrawn by a very small amount, less than 5 dollars. They charged me the 35$ overdraft fee and then, to my surprise, said I had 5 days to bring the account current. Since I was on vacation this was quite a challenge. I asked a friend to make a counter deposit, which occurred n the 5th day. But I was STILL charged the 35 dollar EXTENDED overdraft fee, in addition to the other overdraft fee. I called the bank and they would not budge. I think that is poor customer service and I will always remember how the treated me, all for less then 5 dollars. I also posted this on the Bank of America Facebook Page.","2086":"I have been a customer to BOA for over 10 years. I have really had no issues that I can recall. They're customer service department is always very helpful and polite. I did have one issue with my checking account being overdrawn, but they were able to reverse the charges and fees as a one-time courtesy. I also have a BOA credit card and have had to contact customer service there as well. Again, very accommodating and helpful. I highly recommend Bank of America.","3423":"Mixed Bag Bank of America is one of those large banks that doesn't really care to be anything special.  I have 2 personal accounts with them, a credit card, and used to have a business account with them. For personal things, it's fine. They don't really gouge you with fees, but I would not suggest business banking with them unless you are a larger company.  If you are a smaller company, or a just starting out, look somewhere else. You'll lose a good bit of money to the fees they charge and if you're bootstrapping, you probably can't afford to do that. It all adds up pretty quick.","3424":"Ebanking Accounts Converting i just got word at the branch that my ebanking account will be no more. Boa will start requiring a direct deposit for the account. Or min of 1500 or 250 direct deposit monthly to waive fee.","2088":"I have had the Spirit card for several years. Whenever I have had any issues, it was taken care of fairly quickly. I have not been happy with the amount of miles I can earn with this card. They add up much slower than some other cards I have used. I also had a hard time using the points in the same way that they said I could when I signed up for the card. The flights were many more points than I had been made to believe when I signed up. I will probably cancel the card this year.","531":"Overall, I found this to be a great bank offering many services to a consumer. While I was with this bank, I did not find any serious issues. One of the issues I find with my current bank is the hours. They have very limited hours. They open at 9:00 am and close at 4:00. They also have no weekend hours. I find this to be very inconvenient.","530":"I've had this bank account for years. It is the first one I opened on my own after moving to college away from my parents smaller city and thus away from their smaller bank. For the most part, I haven't had many issues with this Bank of America account. The customer service has been acceptable, and I feel my questions and concerns have been sufficiently dealt with. Until I turned 23, I did not have to pay any fees to maintain the account, which I very much appreciated. However, now that I am 23, I either have to maintain a 1500+ balance, have a 250+ direct deposit, or pay a 12 dollar monthly fee. While none of these are outrageous, it is my one qualm about the account. However, I remain loyal to the bank and have no plans to change. I very much appreciated the advance notice they provided about the switchover when I began being charged the monthly fee, and if I recall correctly, I believe they even waived the fee for a few months.","532":"The BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is one of the best cards I have seen to date. The points earned are phenomenal at 1.5 \u2013 3 per dollar spent. The interest rate is very competitive at about 15% to 23%. Most cards I\u2019ve seen are 19% to 24%. Their late fees are about average but they offer an extended grace period of 25 days! The cash advance interest rate is competitive with cards I have previously used at 24.99%. My last card was 36%. The overdraft protection helps prevent embarrassing situations at the register too.","2089":"I've been using this savings account ever since I moved out on my own and had to choose my own bank separate from my parents. I'm pretty sure that I am not being charged a fee, so I very much appreciate that. The only minor complaint I have is that I wish they had been more clear when I first opened the account about the limit on transfers out of savings each month, but my understanding is that the limit is actual a government rule, not an institutional rule, so I understand it is not their obligation. Overall, my experience with Bank of America has been positive.","533":"It would work better if I could qualify","535":"I have been with Bank of America for 8 years. They have excellent service and friendly staff. The have a very fast updating service so I always know how much money I have in the bank. I do call myself a loyal customer and have enjoyed their services. I have recommended Bank of America to several of my friends.","534":"Bank of America has always been super helpful and open to providing any information I need help with. One time in particular when I went into a branch to submit for a replacement debit card I spoke with a representative about how I could change my address now that I am in a different state without having to change my account number. She informed me the best way to do this and facilitated everything through her computer. I have always been a huge fan and have had accounts with them since I was 18.","536":"I have been a Bank of America customer for years, they were my first checking account ever. Now I am considering switching. They have recently begun charging me a $15 monthly \"fee\" if I dont have direct deposit or keep at least $1500 in my account at all times. I have been with them for 9 years and up until last year there was no \"maintenance fee\" on my account. So what has changed? Also I recently lost my debit card. So I called and cancelled it and ordered a new one thinking it wouldnt be a big deal. They charged me $20 for a new card because my old one wasnt expired yet. Stay away from these people.","537":"I have been with Bank of America for about 6 months now. I have had a very positive experience with them thus far. I had a fraudulent charge made on my account. I received an email stating they canceled my card. Everything was taken care of the very next day. Their online banking is also the best I have ever experienced. You can do just about anything you need online without having to go into the bank or even call them. I would recommend this bank to everyone I know.","538":"With average credit, it is not easy to get all credit cards. I originally had no credit cards in March because of past experiences. My score has gone from average to excellent in eight months. I got approved for their three average cards I have gone from average to good to above to excellent. Everyone will be different in terms of things like past negatives and other various but over time,, if you manage credit wisely, this would really help to improve credit. They are great for people with average credit in terms of own many cards you can get. I hear they are good for people with bad credit with their secured card. After using their cards to build my credit, I now have my pick of the excellent credit cards from American express to the Venture card. I highly recommend them for average credit. Their credit cards really helped me rebuild my credit. As far as I know, I think they offer more cards for people with average credit than any other company.","850":"The BankAmericard Cash Rewards\u2122 Credit Card is a great card! It has smart chip technology which is very useful for international travel. The only downside is the 3% foreign transaction fee. I like the tiered rewards system with 1% on everything, 2% on groceries and 3% on gas. Groceries and gas are two of the things I spend the most on, so this is very useful. Overall, it is a great card!","3425":"Best Bank I really love Bank of America. I have a checking, and savings account, and a credit card through them. I also have my auto loan serviced through them. They have been absolutely amazing throughout my entire experience. I originally opened up an account with them because I liked the interest rates they had on their savings accounts, but then decided to open checking with a debit card along with those others loans and credit cards. Their customer service is superb. Every time I have had to call to ask a question, I always talk to an American who has a clear view of my account and knows exactly how to solve whatever problem I am having. They are always very willing to work with me and surprisingly friendly for a large company. I would recommend to anyone!","539":"The only advantage of the AAA Member Rewards Credit Card is the reward program. I think that it\u2019s great that you can earn 2 points per $1 for gas & grocery. These are the two primary reasons I use my credit card. The 3 points per $1 on all qualifying AAA\/ travel purchases are only beneficial if you travel and use AAA. I think the rewards offered are better than my current card (Chase Freedom Visa) which offers 5% cash back on categories that change every 3 months. I do not like how the categories change because they you will lose rewards for a few months. This card offers better consistent rewards.","851":"Why ?? Does the card NOT WORK at Pipes & Cigars but work other places ??","852":"I had a lot of problems with Bank of America which is why I ended up switching to TD bank. The first problem I had was with the application process. It took well over an hour to set up my checking and savings account. A second problem that I had is that my account had to be under my fathers. The bank told me that I would be charged a monthly fee for my account because I did not make enough money. As a student, working part time, I would be unable to keep up with the monthly minimums required to not result in a fee. I did not have a problem with my account being linked until I realized that my father had access to see everything that I purchased. However, I was forced to agree with this in order to open the account. I also tole the banker multiple times that if I did not have the funds I would like the card to be declined. However, I still got signed up for a program where the bank would take them from my savings. When I contacted customer service they told me that is what I signed up for. I know a lot of other people that have had problems with the customer service as well. This is not a bank that is looking to solve your problems. As a 25 year old independent woman I feel that I should be able to open a bank account without have fees charged and should be respected as my own customer. I am glad that I switched banks.","855":"I used to use bank of america for checking and savings accounts. After all the monthly fees and surcharges I felt like I was being nickle and dimed every month. I had no major problems with the account, but Bank of americas customer service is horrible. So I eventually moved my funds to a credit union and I really couldn't be happier. No more fees and random problems. The savings account wasn't bad, except for the fees that is. But I really didn't want to have to deal with bank of americas horrible customer service. So I didn't bother staying with them.","854":"I had a frustrating experience trying to replace checks. They would not provide free checks but wanted over 25 dollars for them even though I hadn't replaced them in years. They are also not honest about their fees which is very frustrating. I never know what is needed to ensure I do not receive any charges with my account. I cannot trust them as a company and only keep them because of the convenient ATMS.","856":"Years ago I used to use bank of america as my main checking account. My parents had used them so it was only natural I would as well. I regret that decision. I had some many problems with them. I once was charged incorrectly on my billing statement and I had a very hard time getting it reversed. Not to mention the unnecessary monthly fees and such. I switched to a credit union and couldn't be happier.","853":"I have only honestly had one really bad experience with this checking account. Every time that someone would transfer me money inside a banking institution, it would charge me $25, even if it was someone at Bank of America. I was never told this when I first opened my account, which frustrated me even more. After a couple of times of this happening I went into a local Bank of America and discussed what could be done about this, and they ended up refunding me the amount of money that had been charged in fees to transfer the funds. I had an online and ATM type account at the time, they then set me up with a basic checking account so I would not incur these fees anymore. They were helpful in fixing the problem, I just wished I had been informed when I first opened the account about this particular fee.","857":"Bank of America has a solid checking account. I recently added an account with them in order to gain access to a Bank of America Credit Card. Their checking account is a little bit more stringent than others, but is absolutely manageable. In order to have your monthly fee waived, you need to keep an average of $1500 in you account or have at least $250 directly deposited into the account each month. As compared to PNC (my other checking account), these requisites are more strict and held to a higher standard. All-in-all, I am happy that I chose Bank of America.","858":"This bank is just like any other bank; they are designed to separate you from your money. I really have a problem with the fee for the overdraft charges. God help you if a check does not clear for whatever reason...I am talking, of course, not about the checks YOU write but a check given to you as a payment. If that does not clear and as a result, your checks do not clear - this being, in my view, NO fault of your own - then they are more than happy to charge you $35 per overdraft. In all other respects, this bank is only average. Average customer service. Average products. I would, and did, put my money elsewhere.","3426":"Cutting Services I just received papers from another bank for an inheritance. They require a medallion guarantee stamp before they will process the paperwork and BoA delightedly told me they stopped offering this service a year ago. My brother's small bank in which only has two offices offers this but BoA, which is one of the largest won't. I can't get this money without it so will be opening a new account in another bank as BoA is too stupid to keep a simple service like this for their customers. I've had this account for 20+ years but this means closing my account. It will take me months to get my direct deposits and new checks, etc (which means months before I can complete the needed paperwork) settled elsewhere when one simple stamp which takes no time at all would have kept them a customer. Also try and negotiate through BoA website in order to find a way to contact them. LOL...not much chance of that.","880":"I actually really love this checking account. It's easy to attach my credit card, pay my bills, and check by balance in one fell swoop. The only problem is that I wish there was overdraft protection, but I think that this account definitely serves it's purpose. While I've only had it for about a year, I can honestly say I'm happier with Bank of America than I have been with any of my previous banks. Also, when first contacting Bank of America about opening this account, they were extremely friendly and explained exactly what I was getting with this account, which was a plus.","859":"My only bank with a checking account. I joined as a student. Being an international student in USA, it is quite difficult to get a bank account, but BOA has helped me and lot of us in creating a bank account, getting started and that too with a starting balance of 0$. It was amazing how well the customer service is with them. The check depositing with mobile scanner is hassle free, so is the money transfer from other country and to other countries. Thinking of even starting a savings account with them. Hope fully they will continue the same customer support they are providing now.","3427":"Great Bank I would recommend this bank to anybody and everybody. They gave me a checking and savings account when nobody else would. I had problems at first going on line with them and I went to the bank and they were extremely helpful and friendly. They solved the problem really quick.  I have never been in the bank that everyone was not extremely friendly. I do not deposit very much money, but the bank always treats me like gold. I often go negative in my accounts, and they have never charged me a fee. I recommended this bank to friends, and they have all been totally satisfied. I would not ever consider changing banks. They are the greatest bank I have ever dealt with.","881":"just wanted to add that I applied for this recently, wasn't approved online instantly but got a call from Visa and all it was was to confirm identity and that you actually applied for the card yourself. Was approved no problem and wasn't bumped to another card. You do have to have a moderate income and credit rating but for a card with those kind of awesome benefits, that's to be expected. I have yet to use the miles or anything like that but based on the companion fare ALONE, this card will be worth it!","3428":"IRA Rollover When I first started my direct rollover process from Charles Schwab to Bank America I worked with a Financial Advisor that was nice, but not very helpful. He would not answer my emails regarding what I should list as an account number for the check that Charles Schwab would write to rollover my retirement funds. When I went to him in person he was not helpful either. It felt like he was answering my questions, but really wasn't answering them. However, he did submit the necessary paperwork to Charles Schwab to initiate the transfer. One day I received a call from Charles Schwab that they couldn't accept third party paperwork. So I went to Bank America again to ask for an account number. Luckily, the previous Financial Advisor was moved to a different location. The new advisor was able to answer my questions and give me the information I needed, which was the account number. As a result of the delay in receiving the account number Charles Schwab did a force pay out of my retirement funds without my knowledge and the check was already mailed to me. I only found out about the check because the new Financial Advisor was able to give me the necessary information and I called Charles Schwab to update them. When I received the check taxes were taken out, which was different from the usual direct rollovers. As a result, I had to open an IRA account that reflected this or I would be taxed again. I even had to add back into the Bank of America IRA account the taxes that was taken out of the Charles Schwab retirement funds. With the help of the new Financial Advisor I was able to get this stressful nightmare over with. Even though this process was a nightmare the customer service that was given to me by the second advisor improved my overall view of this bank.","882":"What really turned my eye to Bank of America for a checking account is that they offered payment reminders and alerts that I could set up for my own needs. I find being able to work with my checking account via my cell and being able to receive text information from them a real bonus. I'm not always able to get down to a branch and I'm not always near a laptop or computer. Knowing I can access my checking account via my phone is a huge relief. Most banks already have it so that you can set up your checking account to pay this or that bill. I didn't like that too much because it was always too easy to forget about having paid XX bill and then using my debit card and becoming overdrawn. I don't have to worry about that anymore since they have those payment reminders. I'm so glad for those!","3429":"Pretty good overall, convenient. I've been a customer for almost seven years now and I've never really had a big problem with them. I was given the student account when I first applied, and it gave me no fees or anything so that was a really nice perk. Once that expired I was given a regular checking account, no problem. I then switched to an online-only account which is far better in my opinion. I do all of my banking online, on my phone app or on my laptop. Depositing checks is incredibly easy. The only downside to this is if I have to, for whatever reason, speak to an actual teller, I will get charged a fee because it wasn't 'online' specific. If someone were to wire me money or something, I'd get a fee for that if it went through an actual person. The fees aren't too high, but I still think that's a bit unreasonable. And the overdraft fees aren't too kind, either. But, over all, pretty good.","883":"Don't like the way they compute miles","3430":"Bank of American Revealed I was with Bank of America (BoA) for about 2 years. They lured me in after graduating from high school and after the barrage of the typical letters in the mail you get from banks you get as a vulnerable high school grad, I decided to go with BoA. Obviously I wanted a cool and trendy bank, and of course Bank of America fits that in all honesty. Everybody has BoA and knows about BoA. However, I did not know that you pretty much had to be a well-off individual to ENJOY Bank of America... You will get fee'd for something as silly as maintaining a small balance on your account and you will continue to get fee'd until you bring your balance up over these made up thresholds. It's incredible. Also, don't even think about overdrafting, you get fee'd daily if your balance is negative. Sure they have an appealing website, mobile app, and locations everywhere. But unless you have a big balance, you will get drowned in these \"convenience\" fees. There's nothing convenient about being fee'd all of the time!","885":"BEWARE: If you apply for the Visa Signature card, Bank of America can open a credit line on ANY tier of the Alaska Airlines cards. You will only receive the advertised bonus miles if you are approved for a fairly high credit limit that earns you \"visa signature status\". And a high credit score alone is not adequate to get to that status. They do not have a system in place that extends you a counter-offer if you are not approved for signature. You will simply receive a lesser card in the mail and you are stuck with it. Even if they are able to approve you for a higher limit and upgrade to signature after the fact, you still will not get any of the bonus miles advertised in their offer. Without the bonus miles and signature benefits, the Alaska Bank of America cards are really not worth the fees.","884":"I have had this card for 9 months now, and I never had any complaints! I am trying to build credit with it and I have never ran into never sort of trouble. All the payments and transactions go through fast and easily. The cash rewards are an extra bonus that suits me quite well. They have plenty of great opportunities to go ahead and get some cash back on your purchases. I mainly use this card for gifts or beauty products but it is not just limited to that! I would definitely recommend this card for anyone looking to build credit or just purchase items without having to worry about transactions going wrong.","3431":"You need to have money though. My biggest complaint with Bank of America is that they have way to strict transfer and withdrawal limits. They have let me go into negative balances with my recent struggles all too often, and I wish they could be more lenient. Not the best bank for college students. They do have great customer service though. I recommend going with a more flexible credit union if you're young.","3432":"Wonderful BofA Branch Experience I visited a branch of Bank of America in Texas a couple of times to establish new accounts for checking, savings and a credit card. I was extremely pleased with the way they handled my situation and the pleasant attitude of the bank personnel I worked with. Both times I visited the branch without making an appointment to see a banker. While there, I only spent about 10 minutes waiting to be seen. During that time I was was given water and was given updates that it would only be a few minutes more. The first visit to open the accounts took only about 30 minutes and I was given all the information I needed to make a decision easily regarding the specific type of accounts I wanted to open. The banker answered many questions while entering my information.    The second visit was due to an issue with the email address associated with the accounts which I discovered after registering with the bank's website. The email address needed to be linked to a couple of the new accounts but not to the third. I could not find where this type of change could be made on the bank's website and after calling the bank's support line they directed me to visit the branch once more - so I did.    This second visit was just as pleasant as the first visit. After I explained the issue to the banker, it was taken care of within just a couple of minutes. The banker explained that since the update was made at the branch, it was immediate whereas an update via the bank's website would take somewhat more time. The banker also provided some examples of how she used online bill pay to avoid using checks and receiving paper statements which I thought was very helpful.","886":"I am disappointed in Bank of America once again. Because I do not keep enough funds in my account they charge me. It doesn't make sense. The less money you make the more they charge you. How is that fair? Then they double charged me for checks. They just keep taking and taking.","887":"I have had a checking account with bank of america now for about 3 years. Their online banking is good, as it is user friendly and mobile accessible. However, my biggest complaint is the amount of fees they have - 35 dollars for an overdraft! I do still stay with them because of the amount of branches they have all over the United States. It is easy, no matter where you are, to find an ATM either at a branch over or a drive up ATM. It is for that reason I will not switch to any other bank!","3433":"Decent for students, afterwards a nightmare. When I started college, I opened a student checking account with Bank of America. Through those years, it was pretty good. No checking account fees, though I did have fees for my Savings Account. After 4 years, they basically pulled the rug out from under me. I have been getting $12 per month fees for checking, and $5+ per month for savings. $17 in fees is ridiculous, and I get more fees thrown on if I transfer too much money or use my debit card too often, and I think I have been charged for using an ATM more than 3 times. What is that about! It is MY money, I should be able to transfer and use my money as often as I please.  Their mobile and online banking is pretty good- you can deposit checks from your phone by taking a picture of the checks. This has come in handy. But overall, I have been dissatisfied by Bank of America, the king of the hidden fees.","888":"I had a Bank of America checking account for a few years and they had been pretty good for the most part until I had an issue with a check that someone wrote out to me that bounced. I deposited the check and waited the time period for the hold which was five business days. But on the 12th business days the bank withdrew the amount that the deposited check was for saying that the check I deposited had bounced. Now, yes, it did apparently bounce but I did not understand why it took so long and by the time they reversed the deposit I had written checks of my own out against it. I feel they should have contacted me much earlier because they had to know much earlier that the deposit did not go through. When I called and asked them why it took so long, the answer I got was, \"well sometimes it takes us longer to do something about it\". Really, that is not a good answer.","889":"I just recently switched from BB&T to Bank of America because I moved and there were no BB&T locations in my area. Overall, I'd say this checking account was the easiest to use on my smartphone. The overdraft fee is also lower than most other banks. I've never had a problem with using mobile banking at all. In fact, they are reasonably quick with all transfers. Most gas stations have bank of america accepted ATMs, so the annoying $2.50 fee does not effect me at all which is nice.","1300":"I have had Bank Of America for about 2 years now. I signed up because it was a bank that was local to my area. When I went in to sign up the application process was pretty simple. The staff was nice and helpful to me. I got a student account with them because I was in school at the time. This offered a few added benefits. The bank offers reasonable hours and the ATM is always available outside the bank. I would recommend this bank to those in the area.","3434":"Not as great as it used to be I have been with Bank of America for 10 years now, but I am just about ready to close my account as I'm switching to a credit union very soon. I have had many great experiences with BoA in the past, but I have received poor customer service in recent months. On one occasion, I received 4 overdraft fees on a single day, and I am 100% certain it was not my fault. I am very careful with banking, and have never made any mistakes in 10 years until the online system failed me (seriously, it was not my fault!). I was only credited back $19 out of the $140 charge. I felt cheated, but oh well, it's their loss.","3435":"BANK OF AMERICA DESONEST NO LOYALTY I had account's with them for at list 30 years.Without any notice they closed my accounts and cancel of the points I had in my credit cards, at list 100000 point. They gave me a number to call but all there is an answering machine saying there is nothing to do. My Credit is perfect, I always pay all of my balance in my cards in full. My credit to income is about 3%. In my branch they tried to reach someone to get an explanation without any look.The only reason I kept the accounts opened for the last 14 years was because of my credit, and hopping they would come around.I have lowered my balance in this last 14 years because I thought they were treating me very bad.And had much better service in other banks.But never the less they close my accounts. I think because my low balances even though they were more than 4 figures usually.","1303":"This account does what it is supposed to do but I did not like the fees. $5 a month for this service is too much for what it offers. You can do this on your own by transferring a set amount every money manually to a savings account. I would not recommend this and I quit using it when I had it. The interest rate is low and I can\u2019t economically understand why the fee is so high.","1302":"The only good thing about Bank of America is they have branches everywhere I go and their online website works well. All the rest are just the lowest quality. I had to wait for an hour to see a banker. While the banker was constantly helping customers, I saw three guys just walking in the lobby checking in a few customers. The checking account is ridiculous. If you are not careful, you will see fees on your account. You cann't find a free account at all at this bank and it changes its rules on how to avoid a fee all the time.","1301":"I have been a Bank of America customer since 5 years, and opened my first ever checking account there. I use all their features like online banking, online bill tracker, bill payer and their mobile apps too. I have never experienced any fraudulent activity or any sort of mix ups with my BOFA account until now. The customer representative has always been helpful in answering my queries. Few times when I found out there were incorrect charges on my account, they resolved the problem through call. A very good checking account and in comparison to other banks I have found BOFA provides low fees and low over draft fee. The balance requirement is also low in comparison to other banks.","1305":"I have never had a problem with BofA's customer service, but I have occasionally had my bank account frozen for no particular reason other than I made a payment that was slightly higher than the last few chargers. I like cautious banks, but possibly a bit too cautious? Overall, pleased with service, credit interest, etc.","3436":"Leaving After 20 Years I've been with BofA for a long time because their online banking and website were so easy to use.I put up with their fees and watched their customer service go down. I thought that switching to a local bank would be a big hassle,. I also wondered about having few branches and ATM machines to use.But I was wrong! Moving my online payments and direct deposit was super easy and my local bank's online bill pay is also easy to use. As long as I remind the bank about ATM charges, and don't go over $10 a period, using another bank's ATM is no problem. And my local bank does have a few, so using theirs is an option too! Moving money to my online accounts has been a cinch.So, after 20 years in BofA, I'm gone!","3437":"Bank of America is decent I started off with a student checking account with Bank of America about 10 years ago. The main thing I love about Bank of America is how convenient the ATMs are. I have found the ATMs to be located in shopping malls, airports, random street corners, parking lots and various other places. There are quite a few within walking distance of my workplace as well. Their rates have never really been too competitive. The savings account interest rate is pretty much nonexistent. Recently they added a minimum balance of $1500 for my checking account which is very manageable, but I find it annoying to have to constantly keep my eye on it. The few times I have had to step in a branch to do transactions or get service on my account have been very productive. Their branch employees are well trained and professional.","1307":"I like the rewards program for the AAA Member Rewards Credit Card, and the overall offering is favorable for a person with good credit habits. If you are a member of AAA or use their services, you can make good use of the AAA vouchers available for points, and you can also get triple rewards on AAA related automotive and travel expenses.Assuming that I had the credit rating to qualify, I'd get this card, especially since you get rewards on all purchases.","1306":"Can't complain about a hundred dollar bonus to sign up. The card itself is decent. With a zero percent introductory rate for twelve months, it makes a lot of sense to transfer other cards to this card. The rewards are good, and if you have a bank of america account the ten percent bonus really can add up. Would recommend to most, especially if you have a bank of america account already.","1304":"A good checking account overall. I've been with them since I was 16, so around 8 years now. I generally appreciate their customer service. I've over drafted a few times and about half the time, they'll help me out by waiving a few of the fees, so that's nice, not a lot of banks will do that for you. I did have trouble with a representative at one point who wasn't honest about a fee that I was incurring. I thought that I could set up overdraft protection for free and it would automatically draw from savings if I didn't have the funds. The rep made it sound like this was free, when it really wasn't. A good account overall though! I would recommend this checking account service, but like anything, read the fine print!","3438":"BOA Tripled My Negative Bank Account I do not appreciate this bank, and have not since I've started banking with them. I understand an overdraft fee if the funds are not returned within a 24-hour period, but if I have a check being submitted for deposit and you KNOW that, don't charge me an overdraft fee. Their late fees are ridiculous as well, and if you can get to a customer service agent, I don't know why you bothered because they won't help you. I've talked to multiple agents about both good things regarding my account and bad and each one didn't care to do anything above and beyond what was placed in front of them. I have worked in a call center and I know it can be taxing but suck it up and do your job.","1309":"Pretty standard checking account over all. I appreciate the low fees and the fairly low over draft fees as compared to other banks. I really do NOT like the fact that the balance requirements are so high- maintaining upwards of 10k in a checking account is kind of unreasonable. But the fee per month is only 25, so it's not a huge problem. Customer service at BOA is kind of awful though. Overall there are a lot of better accounts in this range I'd recommend before this one.","1308":"When I went of to college several years ago, I needed to have a savings account at a bank that had a branch nearby. I decided to go with Bank of America and I was at first rather pleased with the bank. The most appealing features that this bank offered to me, at the time, were low to no monthly fees depending upon my balance, and the option to enroll in their 'Keep the Change' program. The 'Keep the Change' program helped me save a little extra each month by rounding up any purchases I made using my debit card to the nearest dollar and depositing that money into my savings account each month. What was even better, was that for the first year they matched the amount each month! After graduating from college, when the low monthly fees disappeared I decided to close my savings account with Bank of America. If you are a student, or already have a checking or credit card account with Bank of America, this is a great savings account, but if you are not, there are certainly better options available elsewhere.","1430":"I recently switched over from TD Bank to Bank of America and signed up for the Core Checking Account. My favorite feature is the Keep The Change option. Anytime you use your card it'll round off the purchase amount to the nearest dollar and adds the change to your savings account. The best part is for the first 3 months they will double what ever Keep The Change transactions you make up to a certain limit. It's a very helpful way to stack up those cents, you'll be surprised at how well it works,","1431":"I've had this card for a really long time and maybe only used it once. It came with our membership with AAA. AAA itself has some really awesome benefits (hotel discounts, rental car discounts, flight discounts, etc.) and has gotten me out of a bind many, many times (towing services, roadside assistance). Fortunately, we haven't had to charge to this card much but it's been there if we needed it. Additionally, they have some awesome customer service so don\u2019t be afraid to call. I\u2019m definitely a fan of AAA and if you had to get a card, this wouldn't be a bad one.","1433":"I have been with Bank of America for almost 10 years now and I love the convenience of it. I've not encountered a situation in which I was unable to use my debit card. The customer service is always polite and helpful. But that's as far as the positives go, unfortunately. The massive amount of hidden fees pile on. They are so quick to tack on transfer fees and the fact that they call it a fee \"for doing the transfer work for you\" is beyond obnoxious considering it takes about two keystrokes to transfer money from one account to the other. I stay with Bank of America because of the convenience but I often wonder if it's worth it.","1432":"I opened my first saving account with Bank of America when I was 18 years old, I am now 31 and have stayed with them the entire time. There are aspects of my Bank of America experiences that have been very negative but out of all of them, the savings account has caused the least amount of headaches. I love that I get Keep The Change money put in there with each transaction. That money accrues quickly and I love that extra source of cash flow. There is one thing to look out for though that I just recently found out about. There is a certain type of savings account that charges you $12 monthly for having a balance lower than $1000. I cannot imagine how many times I was charged this fee, unaware that this stipulation was on my savings account (yes I now pay closer attention to my banking than I have in the past). When I brought up the charges with Bank of America they changed my account to the regular one. I don't know why that account stipulation even exists on a checking account?? There is literally no other difference between that type of account and the regular no-limit savings account. I just wanted to give a heads up about this to anyone who maybe doesn't pay super close attention to their account.","1434":"The Bank Americard Travel Rewards Credit Card has a decent interest rate and lets you use reward points towards airline miles.Compare to the Delta Travel Rewards card and you have a card that's a little more well-rounded.It's a good card though, especially if you travel.","2870":"Overall a good bank with lots of branches. The app for check deposits is good.","1437":"I got this checking account when I first went to college and have had mostly good experiences. I like that you can link it to a savings account with a monthly deposit and a Keep the Change feature that takes the misc. cents of any transaction and deposits them into your savings.I've had issues with fees a few times when I made too many transfers in a given month for made a deposit at a teller instead of online.","1438":"I have been with Bank of America for almost 2 years now . This journey has been pretty smooth for me . I never had any major issues with their services . Although few times I found out that their were incorrect charges on my account but they got resolved over the phone very quick . Overall I can say that I am happy with my decision of sticking to the bank. It often helped me in distress . It gives a lot of importance to its customers.","1435":"I've had my B of A checking account for more than ten years. This bank is great about protecting its customers from fraud, but I do wish that the monthly fees were smaller. One thing that is really annoying is that they seem to keep an eye on your balance, and if it falls low, they will wait until it is CERTAIN that a new charge will put you in the red so that you have to pay them overdraft fees. It's frustrating because unless I take a screenshot of my account every single day, I am not able to prove that they do this. By the time I get the notification that I'm being charged an overdraft fee, my account statement no longer looks the way it did before, it pushes everything up so that my balance gets dramatically smaller and then goes in the red. I'm thankful for this bank for the way they've handled my debit card info being stolen, but I feel like I've racked up what they saved me just by paying them overdraft fees later.","1436":"I signed up for a checking account when I started my first job as a teenager. Overall, the checking account was satisfactory. There were low monthly fees if any at all. The online banking is set up to be very user friendly and secure. I found online bill pay to be very useful. The only bad experience I had with BOA, which ultimately led to closing my account, was how long it took for them to correct their mistake on a check I had deposited that I needed to pay my rent. Due to a technical problem with their machine, my check deposit was delayed, despite having my receipt from the deposit. I ended up with a late fee for my rent payment. After contacting customer service, there was no resolution.","1439":"I've been a customer with bank of America and they do have the typical low interest rate like most banks that has a monthly fee unless you have $2500 dollars in account or a monthly direct deposit. However, their customer service is phenomenal which is very helpful and patient whether doing business with them over the phone or in person. I would suggest putting money rather in their money market account, another type of savings that offers 3 times the amount of interest as in the normal savings account.","740":"This was the first checking account I ever opened, and I still have it 7+ years later. While there is a monthly fee, it is easily avoided if you have direct deposit set up for your salary. You can also link it to a BofA savings account, and set it to automatically take out savings deposits. This includes Keep the Change, an optional program that takes the extra cents off every debit card purchase and puts it in your savings account. Additionally, you can set up Bill Pay through the checking account, which is very convenient.The customer service for the account has been awesome, too -- typically a quick response, and they have even forgiven an overdraft fee once or twice. I'm very happy with this account.I do wish there was a way to avoid the foreign fees, such as ATM and transactions while abroad. I travel a decent amount, and I end up trying to get cash to avoid most of these fees. BofA does allow you to withdraw cash for no fee if you go to specific banks like Barclays or Deutsche Bank.","742":"I've had this card for about 3 years, and I really like using it. The tiered cash back system (3% on gas, 2% on groceries, 1% on everything else) is nice, especially since I primarily use the card on gas and groceries anyway. I also got a $100 bonus for signing up!If you get this card, I recommend depositing your cash back rewards directly into another Bank of America account (checking or savings), because it gives you 10% extra if you do that. Applying it to the credit card statement balance is not as good.There is no annual fee, which is great. I've had cards with much worse rewards that charged me an annual fee. Overall, I like it a lot!","741":"This is a great credit card! If you pay it off each month, the interest rate doesn't matter. The companion fare each year is a wonderful perk not to mention the mileage earnings and bonus incentives for signing up! This allows my husband and I to take an extra trip each year without breaking the bank.","744":"I had a Bank of America standard checking account while I lived in Lawton, OK. I loved all the features of the account, especially the online bill pay and the BOA app. It allows you to deposit checks by taking a picture of them, which was a huge time saver for me. It saved countless trips to the drive thru window. There were no fees, and the ATM fees were competitive with other local banks. The only issue I had was locating Bank of America ATMs. If I lived in a bigger city, I don't see this being an issue. However, in a relatively small city, there were only one or two I could go to without being charged a fee. Overall, I would definitely recommend Bank of America for a checking account.","743":"Started this account when I entered college. They surprised me completely out of the blue with a fee that overdrew my account. There were no notifications sent to me at any time and when I tried to resolved this, they refused to negotiate the fee. Instead, they tried to get me sign up for more services. Worst bank I've had in my life and worst service I've had from any company in general. Highly recommended you avoid this bank as a College student.","745":"The BankAmericard offers year around cashback on groceries and gas that are almost unbeatable. Redeeming your points is simple and you even get an additional 10% for depositing it into another Bank of America account. No annual fee along with BofA's customer service has made this card a staple.","747":"I've been with Bank of America for about a decade now, and don't see myself switching away anytime soon. Good customer service, very quick to help with any issues either in person at the branch of over the phone. I honestly can say that I feel very comfortable banking with Bank of America.","746":"I really like the Core Checking Account. I have had BOA for many years. I have never had any issues with them. I like how I can deposit checks from my phone (taking a picture) or any BOA ATM. I haven't been in to a branch for a VERY LONG time, and I am happy about that. Setting up direct deposit was easy. It is very easy to move money to different accounts from your Core Checking as well.","748":"I signed up to use the Spirit airlines credit card while we were on a Spirit flight. Our family travels frequently and are always looking for good travel deals (i.e. free miles or flights) and the announcement for all the free sign-up miles with the Spirit credit card was too good to pass up. At first we were mainly interested just in the perks of getting the extra bonus sign-up miles, but after our first statement we realized that getting 2 miles for every dollar spent was an excellent perk! At the rate we were racking up miles from our purchases, we figured we could count on at least one domestic trip for 4 each year absolutely free. And that is very good news!We will be using this card for quite a while!","749":"I have been a customer of BOA for several years and it wasn't until the change where they are charging fees at a high rate just to keep your checking account open. This change has clearly convinced me that the fees are too high and I rather take my business elsewhere locally where I can have a free checking account and not have to worry about having to keep a certain amount in my checking account each month and be penalized. The customer service people are great and I applaud them for their hard work but when it comes to the rates and services they really have changed for the worse. I've had enough of this and have decided to open my account with a local competitor.","164":"The BankAmericard is a very enticing card to get with all of the features that it offers. Getting 2% and 3% back on grocery and gas purchases is nice and the $100 bonus is really a good reason to get this card. It's also really nice that this card does not charge an annual fee and it gives you a generous 25 day grace period, and with the built in smart chip, there is always a peace of mind when you use this card.","163":"The AAA member Rewards Credit Card is an alright card. It is nothing special really. It has rewards that are AAA related such as car repairs and vouchers good for travel, but it also rewards you with a point system that gives you 2 points per $1 on gas, groceries and drug store purchases. This is a pretty decent amount of rewards for one card and it is especially beneficial to me because I travel by car a lot. Unfortunately, this card does have many drawbacks. For example, the interest rate on this card is a lot higher than a lot of similar cards I looked up. I have also had a couple issues with their customer service department when I tried to call in and dispute a couple of late charges. Their staff was pretty rude to me. Overall, I like this card because it gives me a lot of rewards so I am not going to cancel it, but I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone either.","161":"I have been with Bank of America for 2 years now. No concerns with their products or product offerings, however I have several complaints regarding their customer service. In my experience with them, customer service has always been very curt with me. One time I closed my savings account and a few months later they reopened it and started charging me fees for not having the minimum. It was a pain to get that resolved. Like I said, poor customer service. The checking account works fine for it's intents and purposes, but I don't trust them enough to leave large sums of money in there. I use other banks for my everyday use checking accounts and only keep my Bank of America because it is not worth the time to close it.","162":"I have had a checking account with Bank of America for several years. Of all the banks I have used, I find Bank of America to be the most helpful and professional. I like their bill pay service. However, their fees on my checking are a little higher than I would like.","160":"I love mt Bank of America savings account! I can access my money easily by ATM or on my mobile phone. The application process was painless and I haven't had a single issue with the account since I opened it nearly two years ago. It's wonderful to have an account at a nationwide bank with so many branches! I can always find a bank near me and the tellers are always there to help. I will be staying with Bank of America for a while, simply because of how satisfied I am with this account.","165":"I have been with Bank of America for many years and I have to say that I really like the checking account. I have it linked up with the savings account and find it very easy to manage. I refuse to pay yearly fees! The online access is easy and excellent. I also like the Online BillPay feature and mobile app, which allows you to make payments in any amount to any of your bills for free. This is great, as I was once paying a large bill in small amounts and it was fun to \u201cchip away\u201d at my balance in small increments. I happened to get \u201cskimmed\u201d a few times, and Bank of America quickly replaced the stolen money from my checking account with no questions asked, as they continued their investigation. It has been a great experience having a checking account with Bank of America!","166":"I've been a customer for a long time with Bank of America. The customer service is great and they do have a lot to offer. However, the interest rates they offer for the checking's, savings, etc. is somewhat lower than a lot of other banks. I also don't like how they don't offer any accounts without a monthly fee.","168":"If you're looking to do a lot of travelling, the Bank Americard Travel Rewards Credit Card is a great option.Zero foreign transaction fees, a very competitive interest rate, and lucrative reward points make for a great card.Compare this to the Capital One Quicksilver which has a higher permanent rate, not nearly as many rewards, and foreign transaction fees.If you're going to be travelling, you can't do better than the Bank Americard Travel Rewards Credit Card.","167":"I have been a Bank of America customer for about 2 yrs now. I have never experienced any issues with them or have any complaints. The customer service representatives have helped be during situations were I needed to verify information ASAP. Would recommend this account to other business owners, who can keep the minimum balance.","169":"This card is terrible. I called over 1 year ago to ask that my mom not be charged for an AAA membership since she wasn't driving any longer. They said no problem. Of course when it came time to renew they did it automatically. When I called to have it rescinded they said they couldn't do that unless they got the card back. That is BS since I am a member of AAA and they bill me annually. I can choose to renew or not and no one asks for the card back. We sent the card back over 2 months ago and they still haven't credited her account. Well my mom died 2 weeks ago and I wanted to pay the card but not until the credit was on there. They asked me 20 questions and finally I said look either give me the credit or I am not paying the bill and you can sue a dead person. They got a supervisor on the phone who said that the deceased department would have to call me back. I said no now or never and they said later. So screw you AAA eat the whole damn bill and sue a dead person. If you can avoid this card by all means do so. Automatically charging for the membership should not be a requirement. Worst card ever.","3439":"Great Bank With Great Employees I first got myself a Bank of America banking account back in 2009. At the time I didn't end up using it so I closed the account and ended up reopening it in 2012 when I started my business. The staff is always friendly which is the reason I went back after three years. They are helpful and always have a smile on their face.  I ended up being overdrawn when I moved all my funds into a different account and a previous purchase went through. I called them after putting the amount needed to cover the fee and purchase back in the account and asked for a one time refund if it was possible. I didn't have high expectations but was able to get my $35 back and have been with them since.  Overall, Bank of America is great, they will make you happy. Give them a shot!","380":"This card is really nice. I like it a lot and know someone else who uses it too. Few credit cards are so flexible with their reward points. Its reward system that allows cash the flexibility of cash back is similar to my Chase Freedom card, I can use my rewards for cash or gift cards. The AAA Members Reward Credit Card looks promising, especially to those traveling outside of the country with its acceptance in 130 countries! Not many cards boast of that attribute. All in all it is a decent card.","3441":"hometown feel It is great to walk into a bank where they make you feel at home, even though most of your transactions are done on your phone They greet you at the door, ask where they can help you and take care of all your banking needs right then and there. If they are not positive on the answer it is only seconds and they are on the phone making sure they have the right information for you before you walk out the door. It is great to know that their customer service is on top of keeping it friendly. The other day I went in to check on my equity loan I was personally met by the branch manager ready to assist in anything I needed. Due to more online transaction I was amazed that they still remembered me from years ago when I first opened the account. Things might be going high tech in banking but every once in a while you have to actually go in and it is nice to be remembered.","3440":"hometown feel It is great to walk into a bank where they make you feel at home, even though most of your transactions are done on your phone They greet you at the door, ask where they can help you and take care of all your banking needs right then and there.

However, I do remain with them for one of my savings accounts. I like their \u201cKeep the Change\u201d feature that automatically transfers money to your savings account. Over time, this little bit of change adds up and it is a nice little treat to see extra funds in your savings. Also, their rates on savings accounts is one of the best I have come across, and I can say this because we have 3 savings accounts with other banks.","3442":"Bank Review I have been banking with Bank of America since 2002. It has had different names over the years. It is now Bank of America. My husband and I are happy with Bank of America. We have had no problems with them over the years. We once had to get new atm cards, because I lost mine and then I called in for a new one. We could not get my card to work, so we stopped by Bank of American to correct this problem. The person who helped us was very friendly and courteous to my husband and I. It took about twenty minutes to correct the problem. We were satisfied with the service and left feeling good. I tried my card before I got home. It worked just fine. problem solved.","382":"I have had a Bank of America checking account for about five years now. Although I usually prefer small banks, I have been impressed with Bank of America. When I was trying to get a loan from them, I was able to meet with someone in the bank, and he was very honest about the situation. I was impressed with his customer service. It is very easy to access my account online and review charges. Compared to other banks I have used, their online services are easy to understand. I can view photo images of every check that I deposit. It is nice to be able to access a Bank of America ATM wherever I go","383":"I have mixed feeling about the Bank of American Core checking account. I've had one for years with few issues, and as a student I appreciated the low monthly fee and the fact that my age allowed me to avoid paying any extra fees. However, I did find it annoying that after I turned 24, my monthly balance had to be 1500 dollars in order to avoid being hit with recurring fees. The over draft charges were crazy as well. Now that I'm older the account is pretty much a dud. I barely use it because I don't want to be slammed with fees. The lack of interest on the account also makes it less than great when you look at other banks. Also, this is worth mentioning- their customer service is HORRIBLE. On the few instances where I had issues with my account, they were rude and unhelpful. Overall I guess the account is OK if you're young, but for an adult over 23 it's just a pain.","384":"I am planning on closing my account with this bank after the tax year is up. I have had nothing but problems with Bank of America and their fees are astounding. Their customer service, at least that of the branch I visit the most, is poor, the tellers act as if they are annoyed if you do business with them. I love the versatility of online banking, but sometimes I have to do business with the cashiers to deposit and transfer money or get cashiers checks and between the customer service and the price for certain transactions I have chosen to switch banks as soon as I can.","385":"I have a Bank of America personal checking that is linked to to an overdraft protection account, which is very helpful to me. I also have the \"keep the change\" which puts a few coins aside for me. I have been with Bank of America for almost 9 years now, and find it to be an \"okay\" bank. We did have a mortgage through them and in return had free checking and free savings, however we sold our home last summer and no longer get free checking and are paying $25 a month for a checking account and another $8 a month for our other account. We will be closing the more costly account soon and open an account with a Credit Union that offers free checking. I liked Bank of America while they were our mortgage bank, however now they are not, it is time to part ways.","386":"I opened a checking account with Bank of America a few months ago for a small business I was starting up. So far it seems like a pretty good bank. It was pretty easy to sign up for BOA and the customer service was fantastic! I\u2019m definitely looking forward to doing business with them in the years to come.","388":"I have had my savings account with Bank of America for 4 years now. I opened the account along with my Checking. While I am not a big fan of how Bank of America handles their checking, I do love my savings account. Since it is directly linked to my checking, I can easily transfer funds from my checking to my savings online. My favorite feature of my account, however, is the fact that whenever I make a debit card purchase, the change is transferred into my savings. So if I buy something with my card for 18.48, 52 cents is placed into my savings from my checking. It's a great little way to slowly add to your account. The only thing I would change is the interest rate.","1561":"Its great I love my Bank of America checking account and I have never had any problems. People have complained about the overdraft fees but I have yet to encounter this problem . Overall I feel like Bank of America's checking account suits me well with it being local and very customer first.","387":"I have had a checking account with Bank of America for 3 years. I switched to them because of the current promotions that they were offering at the time. Who doesn't like free money?I like the convenience of the mobile app. They also offer many network atms. It is easy to speak with a live representative if I need to.","1560":"I have been with Bank of America for a little over 4 years now. I made this my major bank account because we did not have Wells Fargo in the area. I do love this bank because it has a very functional online banking site and an abundance of bank and atm locations throughout my area and most of where I travel. However, even when I was a student they did not offer me free checking. I had to (and still do) perform all my banking online and via the ATM. If I use the tellers inside the bank, I am charged a monthly fee of about $10. For this reason, I have a new bank and use this as a secondary account.","389":"The bank of America savings account is just what any person is looking for . Its easy to use and withdrawing its not a strenuous process . Interest builds up pretty quick and I have already made several dollars since my activation. If you want a local bank and savings account Bank of America seems like the way to go.","1565":"The BankAmercard Travel Rewards Credit Card is pretty impressive. This card seems like the perfect option for people who are consistent travelers like my parents. The amount of points you get that can be used for future travels is pretty impressive as well. I like that you can use it for not only planes and hotels but cruises(which is not something you see everyday). I can see that it sucks you can't translate the rewards to cash but I would rather travel to be completely honest.","1564":"The BankAmericard Travel Reward cards looks like a good credit to have with many features that are not offered by other cards. I have two credit cards, one through Chase and one with Discover, and they both only offer 1% cash back on purchases. I also like how they offer an annual 10% customer bonus point if you have a Bank of America account because many people do have bank accounts where they have credit cards and so it's a nice reward.","1563":"It's ok. Service at my local branch isn't the greatest, and after the ATM almost cost me a deposit I go inside to do all my banking now, which makes the less than stellar service ever less appealing. As for the actual account, it does everything I need it to do. Money goes in, money goes out. It does a brilliant job of that. If your local branch has some competent people at it it would be a fine account. But keep looking if your branch doesn't have decent people\/service at it. There are plenty of other banks with comparable accounts, so I think the service you get at each of your local banks would be a big factor here.","1562":"Bank of America's checking account is a pretty good banking option. You can make deposits from a cell phone or at ATM machine. The only issues I have is that the branch managers don't have much authority if you have a problem that needs resolution. I also don\u2019t like how banks are so open in that when discussing your personal information everyone can hear. Additionally having to enter a long account number on their automated system for my balance is pretty inconvenient.","1567":"I have been banking with bank of america for 2 years now. I liked the service at first but started noticing the outrageous overdraft charges after over drafting 1 time. Another thing that I don't like is that in my area all of the atm machines are drive up only with a machine just sitting in the middle of the parking lot on a cement island. This does not seem safe at all, and I even had my bank card skimmed which I think may have a lot to do with the way the atm machine is set up.","1566":"I have had this account for about a year or so now, and I really wish I had the money to change accounts.. There are some good things I do like and I will list those first, the online and iPhone interfaces are great and secure, and the web app is too, the money transfers are fast when going IN to the account, and even faster coming out and that leads me to my issues. The fees. The fees that bank of America charges are insane. 15.00 out of a money transfer regardless of amt, 12 dollar monthly service fee, overage fees, 'maintenance' fees... WHAT?! I am really really disappointed with this bank and it's checking accounts.","3443":"Good Guidence As I'm new to the USA and was supposed to open a savings account, but I was bit hesitant to ask questions. The bank members helped me to overcome these barriers and enjoy banking. Now I'm familiar with all the common banking transactions, and I thank BoA for helping me.","1568":"I have always had a good experience when dealing with Bank of America. The people are very friendly and always help me find a solution to any concern that I may have. I would fully recommend this bank to family, friends, and anyone who wants to deal with professional bank employees and avoid the hassles that other banks tend to put you through. Another thing I like is that I never wait too long in line to get to a teller.","1569":"I like the rewards and how they waived my first late fee.","490":"The AAA Member Rewards Credit Card has the smart chip technology that puts your mind at ease when using it at a store or online, with all the credit card fraud happening this is a great feature. It is always nice to earn rewards while using it also. All in all it is a decent card.","3444":"Lots of fees Bank of America has many ATMs which is convenient and has local branches available throughout the country which allows me to do banking even when I am travelling. Since I tend to travel quite a bit for work as well as pleasure, access becomes a problem with many of the smaller banks. This is generally not a problem for BoA.  Bank of America charges fees for everything however. If I happen to be somewhere where there is not a local ATM, use of another ATM results in several dollars in fees for each transaction. Credit card fees are high. Overdraft protection is available and you can link a credit card to your checking account to prevent overdraft fees. Unfortunately, if you use the overdraft protection you are charged a significant fee. If there were 2 pending transactions in your account they will transfer money to cover the first and charge a fee then transfer money to cover the second and charge another fee.  They allow mobile deposit now which is a wonderful convenience, but it takes several banking days for funds to be available. Getting an \"acceptable\" picture of a check can be challenging but otherwise the mobile deposit process is easy. Unfortunately funds are delayed in getting to my account. For my last deposit, that meant funds were not available for 6 calendar days and my account was then \"overdrawn\" when my bills were paid despite the fact that I had deposited over $2000. I was then charged overdraft fees for the account and over draft coverage fees for each transaction. This means that near the end of the month when my mortgage is due, I need to drive to the bank to deposit my check instead of using the mobile deposit feature. This defeats the purpose of mobile deposit.  The mobile site and website are fairly user friendly but are down often, especially in the evenings when many people are available to bank. Online bill pay was easy to set up and consistently pays my bills on time.","491":"The BankAmericard Cash Rewards card provides everything that you could want with a credit card, and the $100 bonus makes it real enticing. But the thing I like best is they do not charge an annual fee that a lot of other cards charge. And the chip technology puts your mind at ease when making purchases either in a store or online.","3445":"Wouldn't Suggest Bank of America I've been with Bank of America for several years and although they are an okay bank I wouldn't say they were the best bank I've ever banked with. My biggest complaint would have to be the overdraft fees, or rather the fees they charge in general. Seems they try to find any and every reason to try and charge a fee. I cannot count how many times I've gotten charged an overdraft fee for my account overdrafting even if I put money in my account that same day to save my account. According to them one doesn't get charged an overdraft fee until all charges are cleared and not pending anymore but I find that is not the case at all with them. I've put money in my account while charges were still pending and have still been charged fees. I also notice they will charge several overdraft fees back to back for different charges unlike most banks who charge one overdraft fee altogether just for overdrafting period. The only reason I've even been with them so long is because I've grown so used to being with them that I don't want to go through the hassle of switching all of my information over to another bank as far as my direct deposits and bills.","492":"The Bank of America savings account has many benefits. I like the on-line access, the rewards that you get. At least monthly I go online and select from a wide range of retailers that if I buy something I get cash back. Sometimes it take a little while to get the funds redeposited but they always end up back in. I have been banking with BOA for about 15 years and they are great. The savings has a low balance requirement in order to get the account for free.","3446":"Father Died 2 1\/2 Years Ago, Still Waiting For Money My father Carl, died April 16th, 2012. you Bank of America sent me forms since my Mother and I were not on his account. My Mother is 90 years old and blind. We filled out your forms, had them notarized twice sent them twice went to the branch (6) times. They called your small estate unit. I was promised last month the check will be in the mail within 24-48 hours, since all this time his checkbook has been charged a service fee because he died and you can't get your act together. The last small estate form I filled out I went over it with your people and they said everything was correct? Now you send me another letter telling me these forms are out of date so go to \"google\" and find one and fill it out! I hope and pray in your lifetime you never have to have to go through what we have been through. I've lost my Dad, I'm taking care of my Mother, we are not rich, wow talk about the worse customer service. I will say a prayer that no one else has to go through this, what a disappointment you as a banking institution have proven to be. I'm so happy in my life I treat people better than this.","493":"I have had this savings account for close to a year now. I like that there is no fee for this account and it is very convenient for me to transfer funds to it from my checking account. There is some interest but it is really minimal. You don't get this account for the interest really.","494":"I have had the BOA core checking account for about 5 years now. It's not too bad. I really dislike the 12 dollar maintenance fee if you do not have direct deposit or do not keep the high dollar amount in the account. I do love mobile banking. I do not think I have been inside a branch in years. They have been great about fraud protection. I would give 5 stars if the fee was so not high.","496":"I was looking for a free checking account with some type of interest. The Bank of America checking account did fit the bill for me. The one thiing I'm not fond of is the high overdraft charges.However, there are Bank of America branches pretty much everywhere. The convenience of this is worth it to me. I have had my account for about 6 months now and do not have any major complaints. I also like the convenience of having a Bank of America app.","495":"I\u2019ve had a checking account on Bank of America for a few years. I have not had many problems with them. There have been times where I was charge without consent and ended up over drafting. Their overdraft fees can get very expensive, and they keep charging more and more until you pay. I called and explained the situation I was in, and they were able to waive those late fees as I sorted out with the company that charged me without my permission.","3447":"New to banking. I dont do that much banking seeing as I have only been paid in cash. When I was younger I would have my parents deposit money for me to my savings account for me. I guess I still do that but not I can go online and check my balance. I am a huge spender and quite a miser when it comes to spending money. Overall Bank of America seems like a solid bank and I dont have any real complaints. I did wish they had that Amazon Rewards credit card like Chase has.","497":"I run a wedding and event planning business from my home, and this was the first credit card I received to build my business. Cash Rewards for Business MasterCard credit card can't be beat for the small business owner of today. Most cards provide us with no real incentive to use it for a business person. Many times the rewards aren't monetary in nature. This credit card provides actual cash back instead of gimmicky \"rewards programs\".I highly recommend this card to new small business owners that I meet. It is perfect for getting started and saving money.","498":"As we all know bank of america is nations leading financial institution, I could say it is also the best financial institution. I have a checking and savings account and I also own a credit card with them. The customer service is really awesome, they talk to us with real patience and I always clear all my questions and get the perfect solution to my problem.","2360":"I\u2019ve had Bank of America now or about 3 to 4 months now and I love it it\u2019s easy to access my money and they don\u2019t charge a high fee in order for me to use the banking\/checking account I would recommend a lot of people to use Bank of America checking accounts my family has always used them and the wont do you wrong you the interest rates are amazing","499":"I opened this account about 2 months ago.It was easy to open -- did so on their website; I already have existing checking with them.I linked this account to my checking to cover over draft and for ease of transfer in both directions.I think this setup would be fine for most users.","2362":"I joined Bank of America when I turned 18. I had $100 to deposit and went to the bank. My customer service experience was very pleasant straight from the beginning. When I arrived I did not have to wait long to be helped. The teller I spoke to walked me through every step of the sign up process. Any questions I had were answered thoroughly and efficiently. It did not take me long to have everything set up. It was a great experience.","2361":"Bank of America Savings Accounts pay a very small interest rate but they charge no fees and have no minimum balance requirement. I use the account to save money for any purchases I have planned out in advance and can set an automatic deposit from my checking account for a certain timer interval. It is a no frills account, but that is typical with most savings accounts from branch banks.","3449":"Won't Go Near Teller Counter I stopped going to the teller counter when B o A started a practice of discussing my personal banking arrangements in front of other customers while they wait in line. Nor do I want to hear them discuss another individual's banking while I WAIT in line and delayed. B of A has shown NO RESPECT for my privacy, nor do they understand the word No. I have told them many times that I am not interested in what they are peddling. The last straw was when I was in a branch and overheard a meeting between the manager and staff (in the open) about what questions to ask their customers when they come in. I asked them once to put a message on my screen to stop this - didn't work. I won't go near the counter anymore. I'll do my banking by ATM. I also avoid certain branches where their manager is brain dead. Shameful lack of concern for customer privacy and service. I do business with two other banks and never run into this - I will shift more business to them. I have years of bad experiences and can't wait to shift banking.","3450":"Won't Go Near Teller Counter I stopped going to the teller counter after several episodes where I just wanted to deposit a check, but was questioned by the teller on whether I wanted the cash rewards card and other matters that should have been privately discussed, instead of out in the open in front of other customers waiting in line. First, the specifics of my banking arrangement are private - not to be discussed in public without any forewarning. Secondly, if I want to change my credit card, etc, I will call or set up an appointment. I find this encounter in such POOR TASTE. I conduct business at three banks - B of A is the only bank that does this. Yesterday I overheard the bank manager strategizing on what questions they need to ask their customers. Finally, I have told B of A that I do not want a particular credit card that they have pushed on me several times. They don't get it - so I avoid doing business in the branch. I am disgusted at this B of A practice and they should be ashamed of themselves showing so little respect for their customers' privacy.","3448":"Won't Go Near The Teller Account This is the third time I've tried to post a review - the bottom line is I hate Bank of America and give it ONE STAR. Now I have to rate this website a ONE STAR. I can only assume my previous two ratings have been blocked. This is so typical - I will now have to go into the branch manager's office at two branches and tell them off. Shame on Bank of America for having NO RESPECT for my privacy and taking advantage of customers when they just want to conduct banking - not discuss their banking details in front of customers who have to wait in line while B of A tries to peddle a different credit card, etc. I can only assume whatever change is being peddled benefits them, not me, or else I would have made the change myself. I am disgusted by B of A, and can go on and on about their 800# but what's the point? I can't even get this review posted.","2363":"Recently, I contacted Bank of America to determine how my credit card with them compared to another credit card (whose information I had received in a mailing). I was quickly speaking to a customer service representative and she was very pleasant to speak with. She was not defensive about the topic and answered all of my questions. Well, I\u2019m still a customer. That says a lot about her customer service skills and the options that my Bank of America credit cards offers.","2364":"I have a checking and savings account opened with Bank of America and everything has been fairly smooth so far. Once they made a mistake with one of my joint accounts and charged us for maintenance fees -- but once I notified them, customer service was quick to resolve the issue. I am applying for a credit card soon and I am considering their Cash Rewards credit card.","3452":"The Best is Truly The Worst to Me I was a member of Bank of America for about 3 - 4 years. Customer Service was spot on, most of the time. What I couldn't understand were the fees for every minute thing, and most of the fees were ambushes; meaning, you weren't warned before hand by the agents whom displayed such awesome customer service. This is a red flag to me. If you're smiling, I assume that you're trustworthy. But in the end it just seems like they're good at creating friendly environments for profit. There was no other bank that took $8 per month out of my account. This was for \"maintenance fees\" as they say, but I wasn't made aware of this. Then, there was a document that I read that said this fee would be removed whenever there wasn't at least 125 in my account. This wasn't made aware to me. After looking through documents of my own free will, and not after being recommended to do so, i discovered this. The bank has set a fee for just about every service that a you could think of, and in most cases wouldn't be a charge at another bank. My suggestion is go elsewhere if you want a bank that will HOLD your money, and not extort you legally, through contracts and misunderstanding. The banks name should be changed, as it gives the country a bad name.","3451":"Bank Review My experience with Bank of America has been a largely positive one. I mostly use online banking, and the website is easy to understand and to navigate. I am comfortable using it for my banking needs. On some occasions, I need to go to a physical branch of the bank, I have also encountered friendly customer service. Though the lines may be long, I feel that the tellers and staff do their best to serve me and my banking needs. I would say that the Bank of America is a good bank.","3453":"thank you Thank you again for helping me when Paypal tried to screw over my financial picture. Bank of america's staff were very understanding and helped me to open up a new account and transfer funds when paypal tried to steal my life savings.","2365":"I have a savings account with Bank of America because I have a checking account with them. At first I wasn't going to get a savings account but then I decided to try it out. I feel like it was a great decision because now I am able to save money. The savings account fee is waived because I have a balance that is greater than 300 dollars so there are no fees associated with my savings account. I feel that I will continue to have a savings account with Bank of America for a while.","2366":"I was looking for a checking account that let acquire interest and that is how I found Bank of America. Not only do I get interest on my account, but it is also a bank that has many outlets. There is almost a Bank of America on every corner, which is always helpful when I need to get some cash or deposit a check.","3454":"An Average Bank I've had a checking account with this bank for over five years now and I'm reasonably happy with the experience. I have heard of others having negative experiences with BOA, but those had to do with aspects of their business which I have no experience with. Speaking as someone who isn't looking for anything fancy in a bank I have no reason not to recommend them. The only minor thing I can say is that their online system sometimes wouldn't work for me and it was difficult to reset the password, but this was rare.","2367":"The BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card looks like a great credit card and I would like to apply for it. I use my credit cards to pay for most of my items, and I really like that I can get 1.5 points for every dollar that I spend, which is more than my current credit cards offer me. I also travel pretty frequently, as I have family members that live out of the country, so earning more points by using it on airline purchases is very beneficial to me. I also like that there are no foreign fees with this card.","1240":"I was happy with Bank of America for a while. They are a major bank, so I never had to worry about fraud, etc.However, twice while traveling I called and gave them a heads up that I would be in other states, etc, so that my debit card\/ checking account would not have a hold put on it. Of course both times, my debit card had a hold on it. This wouldn't have been a huge deal, except one of the times, I was in Las Vegas and it was Saturday of memorial day weekend, so I literally had to borrow cash from a friend to get me to Tuesday. I then had to take a cab to the off strip BoA location, which probably cost me 60-80$ round trip. The fact that this happened a few weeks later in Seattle was ridiculous.They also have charged me some ridiculous service fees at times, which is why I plan to leave BoA at some point. I gave them way too much business to ever be charged a fee.","1241":"I used to have a Bank of America Core Checking account.They would repeatedly give me overdraft charges because my bills came in automatically one day before my direct deposit. Every month, the same thing would take place for a full year. Being fed up with the bank I call to see why and they told me it was based on time and that they could do nothing about it. As my bills came in at 5 pm and my check came in at midnight. After much fussing and gnashing of teeth, they let me speak to a supervisor who refunded a full year of over draft charges and promised this problem would be taken care of. The next month gets here, and low and behold, the same thing has happened again. I've moved my business to a different bank.","2369":"I have had my bank of america account for over 5 years. It was my first bank--and i've gone to other banks for promotions but have always gone back to bank of america. They offer the most secure checking account and the best customer service I had experienced out of all the banks that I have been to. I trust them, and that's why I wouldn't ever go anywhere else! HOWEVER- IF YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH OVERDRAFTING BEWARE. Bank of america doesn't offer overdrafting forgiveness, and if you let the overdrafting go they continue to charge you extended overdraft fees which are over $30 each time. The overdraft fees are all outrageously high. That was the worse issue that I faced and pretty much the only issue. http:\/\/wallethub.com\/d\/bank-of-america-1001092b\/?r=1#","2368":"I just recently got the core checking account with bank of america. I find it to be okay. I think the fees are pretty high for a checking account but as of so far I haven't had any major issues. Every time I need to talk to a customer service representative they give me excellent customer service. I like the fact that I can deposit checks via my phone. I will be adding direct deposit soon so as soon as I do this the fees will go away and it will be a pretty much perfect bank account to me.","1246":"I have had less than pleasant experiences with Bank of America. I have had this account for over 10 years and I can't stand the fact that they rearrange your transactions so that you have more potential to overdraw your account. This has happened on several occasions and each time that I call to complain, I do not get my issue resolved. This has been a very frustrating experience to say the least.","1245":"I have this account and I like it very much although the only thing that I do not like are the extra fees that they have when your over drafted and they charge you a additional 35 for the extended fee I think that this should be taken off for the simple fact it seems a bit much and nothing should be like this on accounts becuase your already charged the intial fee why charge you a additional","1244":"I've been really pleased with the service and the customer service I've received whenever I've had questions about my checking account. Using the online chat feature on BoA's website to talk with a representative was super fast, professional, and my questions were answered completely. Definitely the best banking experience I've had so far, and it's accessible to me even while traveling. I massively prefer the online chat feature to get immediate assistance with whatever questions I have, as opposed to calling in, working through the automated menu, and being stuck on hold for what feels like forever before getting the exact same service. Opening the account was super easy, all the fees and ground-rules were clearly outlined (and I thought very reasonable), and BoA has never violated that contract. Great bank, great service, great checking account!","1243":"I've been very frustrated in the past with how quickly they'll stop my account with fraud or travel without consulting me. All of a sudden I won't be able to use my debit card and had no warning so will have to call to get to the bottom of the issue. It can be very frustrating when you can't access your own money and might be put in a bad situation. Monthly fees are annoying as well.","1242":"I have had BoA for about 2 years now and I must say that this is the best bank I have had the opportunity to bank with. I previously banked with a local credit union and didn't get near as good of service as I do with Bank of America. It's the small things the BoA offers that I really like, such as being able to transfer money to friends and family through their app, and being able to deposit checks by taking a picture on my phone. If at anytime I have an issue with a transaction I can easily chat with a rep via their online chat and get the issue resolved right away. I definitely recommend them.","1247":"I have had this checking account for over ten years; I do not have any complaints about it other than the fact that there is no interest offered. Bank of America doesn't charge any fees for me since I have direct deposit with them, and I'd rather have no-fee than an account that offers interest. Ideally they would offer a zero fee interest checking account (I'm not sure if any banks offer that currently)...but for now this account is ok for me.","1248":"I'm not sure I would recommend the Bank of America Savings Account to people who are looking for a new savings account. I've had my account for about ten years (just out of convenience, because I also have a checking account at BofA) and have considered switching to a bank that offers interest and low\/no fees. The only Pro of having this account would be pure convenience for me. Cons would be that it doesn't have competitive interest rates, and the bank charges a fee for a certain number of withdrawals per month.","3455":"Not Too Bad I've been with Bank of America for about 7 years now. I enjoy their mobile app and especially their keep the change program. They have always had excellent customer service-especially when you call. I just wish they didn't have so many fees and requirements unlike other banks. I feel pretty confident that my money and identity is safe with them.","1249":"This card is pretty good, It gives 2% back on grocery stores and 3% on case for the first $1500 combined purchases of those two every quarter. There is no way I would spend more than that on those two items every month. This is stuff I would normally have to buy for my day to day needs and it is nice to get good rewards from it. The $100 reward for $500 in purchases in the first 90 days is pretty neat as well. There is no other rewards on the other hand, just the usual 1% on everything else. I like how it gives an extra bonus to be redeemed into a BofA account.","3456":"Great for what I need Bank of America was my first bank and it is a bank that I have stuck with throughout the years. When I first signed up, it was painless to set up their e-banking account so that I can access my bank account online from anywhere. They consistently release new features, such as a smartphone app that allows you to directly deposit checks using your phone's camera.  The only bad thing that I could say about Bank of America is that there are some fees that are questionable. For example, I was under the impression that if I had to use a brick-and-mortar sites' services, I would be charged $8.00 or so (I was told this around 2010, I'm not sure if the policy has changed since then). This is a bit limiting, but since I never go the actual site, it is not an issue for me.","3459":"Great, reliable bank I've been using Bank of America for about ten years now. I have to say that I've had a wonderful and positive experience with their company. Their online banking makes money management extremely simple for me. Any time I need to know my balance or what I've spent, I just log on and click around. It makes staying organized very simple. Their customer service has always been top notch as well. Any time I need to call in, aside from a bit of wait time, they're always courteous and professional. When I have to go into the actual bank, they're always nice as well. I never get any fees or any problems with my account, so I'm very happy with the service.","3458":"reliable but overrated I have been with bank of america for a long time. Although it serves its function as a bank pretty well, there are times when the bank will impose absurd random fees. The good part is that if you call them up, they will waive the fee. However, it is still a needless hastle. Another lame thing is the luck of meaningful benefits. Could they not go an extra mile to retain the business of me as a customer?","3457":"Bank of America Review Bank of America is one of the major banks in the United States. There large size almost ensures that regard less of where you are living, there will be a location near you. This is very convenient for someone that frequently travels. Furthermore, the customer service is outstanding. In previous experiences, a quick call to the bank and my problem would be solved within minutes. The current programs also allows for a free of charge checking, savings, and credit cards. Bank of America is the ideal bank for all of your banking needs.","3460":"Great, reliable bank I've been using Bank of America for about ten years now.

I never get any fees or any problems with my account, so I'm very happy with the service.","870":"I have done business with Bank of America for years, and had boasted about it regularly but, six years ago, I closed my account. The service had deteriorated, and my balances were affected by their change of policies. They were not knowledgeable in the products that inquired about, and were unable to answer my questions regarding my existing account. They responded with apathy. This, and their lack of attentiveness lead me to believe that they did not care, and I was possibly right about my concerns that they were making accounting mistakes. What was interesting is that I experienced almost the same level of customer service across the board. Like I said, that was six years ago. Maybe they've changed but, I would definitely test their customer service quality because I've learned that there comes a time when it really does matter.","871":"I recently opened a Bank of America checking account. Everything was going fine with it until i checked my balance last week and i was charged $35 for being 3 cents over drawn in my account. I had used my check card at Redbox and somehow it made it go into the negative 3 cents. I called the Bank of America customer service and explained the situation, they were very nice and friendly and right away refunded the $35 fee they had charged for being overdrawn. The girl on the phone had a bit of a laugh they they did that over 3 cents. Great customer service on there part and i was very please i was able to resolve this issue without much effort.","876":"I love my Bank of America checking account. They have really great customer service. It was very easy to sign up for - all I had to do was fill out an application online. I received all of my information (account number and routing number) and debit card less than a week later. My wire transfers only take a couple of days, much better than my old bank. Banking online is really convenient.","873":"My account became a BoA account when they bought out my bank years ago, so I didn't really choose them. I would say the only thing I enjoy about this account is that BoA has many ATM locations which make withdrawals and deposits easy.However, there are still occasional issues with the fact that I opened my account in one state and now live in another. BoA keeps saying that they are trying to integrate systems which will end these issues but it never happens. It's not a big issue, the problems rarely crop up, but solving their \"integration issue\" doesn't seem to be a priority, despite what I have been told. As a premium account holder I have also tried to have legal documents notarized there once - but they insisted on charging a fee, whereas other banks do that for no cost. It just seemed a typical practice of \"fee creep\" that seems to be rampant at BoA (and other banks to be fair) since 2008. Considering their part in the mortgage scandal and recent huge government fines related to that I mostly feel I should move my money elsewhere. I get a bad vibe about their ethics.","875":"I was a Bank of America checking account customer for several years. I initially opened an account with them because it was who my employer banked with and it convent. The initial process of opening the account was easy. They even urged me to open a second checking account and convinced me with would also be free with added perks. I had no need for this account, but agreed for the perks. At this time charged started racking up on my first account. This went on for several months, I tried over and over again to get a clear answer from customer service and everyone gave me a different reason. When I was finally fed up and tried to close my account, they gave me issue with that as well. I encountered bad customer service and hidden fees. I will never bank with them again!","872":"I have had several accounts with Bank of America for quite a few years now (checking and credit card), and I recently added a savings account. I couldn't be happier. The fees are inexpensive to non-existent. If you keep a minimum balance of $300 in your savings account, they waive the monthly fee. They have also been very easy to work with and they have a great online platform. I hardly ever have to go into a branch because I can do everything online or in my phone.","874":"I recently opened a Bank of America account after receiving a credit card from this bank and enjoying their rewards program. What I liked about the savings account is that you do not get charged monthly if you have the three hundred balance in the account at all times, which I usually do. Also I enjoy I am able to link my accounts online so I can see the activity in all my bank of America accounts at once. The people have been very friendly and worked with me right away.","3461":"A solid bank I've been banking with Bank of America for a few years and I've had very few problems with them. The customer service at every location I've been to has been great. Once time I even needed some notary work and they were more than happy to help me out free of charge. The Bank of America mobile app is easy to use and great. I've deposited money, moved money around in my account, and even applied for different banking needs all from my phone. The only caution I would give is when setting up the account. Bank of America will try and add unnecessary monthly fees. Just make sure to avoid those and you'll have a great experience.","3462":"My Bank my Choice. Bank Of America Weston Commons I personally love Bank Of America. I have a fairly new account so they really don\u00b4t know me. I had a case to were I had cancelled a withdraw from an insurance company. Of course, they tried to take the money anyways, and made my account negative. I called Bank Of America, and spoke with a very nice rep. You can totally tell that she wanted to help me. Long Story short lets just say my account is back positive and I will be staying with them!!!. The only bad thing are the fees for annual credit card, personally I think is a little to high.","879":"I have had a bank of america account for over five years now. Bank of Americas customer service has always been second to none in my opinion and anytime i have encountered a problem i was treated as a valuable customer. I had a problem with my checking account about a year ago after i had lost my wallet. I figured i had left it around the house somewhere as i often have however when i saw multiple transactions posted to my account online i realized this was not the case. I called customer service fraud department and they assisted me in cancelling my card and recouping my lost funds with ease. It was an overall pleasant process considering and i will continue to be a loyal Bank of America customer for the foreseeable future.","877":"I've had this checking account for about 5 years now. It started off as a student checking account and then after some time it transformed to this one here. It does what I need it to do. If I ever have a problem come up it's usually nothing that doesn't take more than a phone call to fix. Problem is that it can take between 15-20 minutes to get someone on the phone. I've had a few problems avoiding the maintenance fees. I'll never understand why I have to pay someone to hold MY money. Not to mention that BofA likes to list your withdrawals not in the order they receive them but by deducting the largest ones first thereby maximizing the overdraft fees that can occur. I can't wait to take my business elsewhere.","878":"I have been with Bank of America for about 5 years or so now, and I couldn't be happier. For me, at the end of the day, it's all about customer service. Bank of America's customer is second to none. Everytime something comes up such as fraud comes up (rarely) it is fixed no questions asked andthe money is put back into my account the same day. I have never had to wait while they investigate. Everyone in the branches is always very nice and friendly. I would recommend (and I do) Bank or Amrican to anyone.","2300":"I used my Bank of America credit card at a restaurant and after checking my account online I noticed that the charge was significantly higher than it should have been. I called Bank of America and the customer service rep called the restaurant with me on the line. The customer service rep had the restaurant change the amount charged to me and let me know that if I had any other problems to call back and they would be taken care of.","3463":"Great Bank, Great Customer Service If you are looking for a bank that doesn't treat you like a number, then Bank of America is for you. Yes it is a huge bank and there are lots of branches, but I never feel like a number. They help me by always being available if I have any problems or questions with my account. I also was able to get a great deal on a credit card through them. I also have a savings account which helps me save for a retirement in the future.","2301":"I had an account with BOA years ago. When I first started with them everything was perfect. However after a few years, I began to notice they would approved the big transactions first even when smaller transactions were made before the larger ones. This incurred overdraft fees well over $400. Needless to say after it was over and done I decided to switch banks. The one this I did like about them is the ease of getting everything situated out.","2303":"I just recently opened a checking account with Bank of America for small business purpose. The customer service, as well as the application process, was great. I discussed my goals, activity, as well as business purpose with the bank's employee, and I felt that BoA would be a good choice. I have a number of other bank accounts for various purposes, and so far feel that BoA matches up very well. In terms of disclosures,I felt that there was some confusion at times, but due to a helpful staff, and seemingly proper conflict resolution, my doubts were set to ease. Also, BoA is very prominent in my area with his helpful for both my business, as well as my employees. Overall, I would recommend BoA,","2302":"I don't have many complaints about my Bank of America savings account. The account is very basic with no ways to earn points or rewards of any kind. However, if you are linked up with a checking account you can earn cash back offers which is beneficial. With Bank of America, they have a 0% liability policy. So, if you call and report that there has been fraudulent activity on your account, they are usually pretty good about taking off the charges immediately. I've never had any problems with this whereas with banks in the past this has been an issue. Overall, I don't have any complaints. This savings account does it's job and I'm happy with its simplicity.","2305":"I couldn't be more happy with this card. It has become my favorite. People complain about the high annual fee, but it is well worth, and inexpensive compared to American Express. The rewards are great, and multiply fast. My favorite part is the companion ticket I get every year. It makes our flights for our annual trip much more inexpensive and allows us to spend the money on other parts of our trips!","2304":"I've had this card for a few years, and I'm not completely sure how to feel about it. While this is the main card I use, I don't necessarily feel as though there needs to be the huge yearly fee that is charged. I'll admit, I've had to max out my time in their grace period more times than I'd like, which was a good feature for me to have. I would recommend this card to someone who doesn't mind paying the large annual fee.","2306":"I have been with Bank of America for almost 10 years now and have not experienced any issues with them. Since opening the account the customer service reps have been very helpful and accommodating to any requests I have had. Every time I have gone into the bank with a question they have always been very helpful and quick with responses. I would recommend them as a bank to anyone who is looking for a bank account that doesn't hit you with a lot of fees all the time.","2307":"The interest rate Bank of America offers on their checking accounts is about as low you can find. They literally offer .03 percent on the almost 20,000 dollars that I keep with Bank of America. Most other banks would offer 20 times this rate. The money market accounts are almost as bad and just make it harder to make large transfers. I would recommend banking else where if it is at all possible.","3464":"My experience with Bank of America I have my checking account with Bank of America from 2006. I am very pleased to say that I am a customer of Bank of America. Their online banking and mobile applications are one of the best in the industry and very secured. I like the way they secure customer personal information and identity. They are in the industry for ages and they are one of the oldest bank in the USA history. They are very reputed for their excellent customer service. Though their fees are reasonably high I would still go with my back for their excellent customer service and their competitive products. Overall I can give my rating as excellent and I would always recommend my bank to my friends and relatives.","3465":"Long time account holder I have been a long time account holder with Bank of America. When I visited the bank for the first time it was not with the intent of opening an account, I had accompanied a friend who was opening an account with the bank. The customer service was so high in quality at the bank that I decided to open an account as well. Since that day, 10 years ago, I have held an open checking account with Bank of America and recommended it to all my friends that were seeking to set up checking or savings accounts. I feel Bank of America has always went above and beyond the necessary requirements to insure any issue I have had with my account was resolved in a manner most beneficial to me, including the waiving of fees in more than one situation.","3466":"Bank Of America NOW A Joke! I thought I would never say this about this bank until recently like within the last year. I have been a customer since Boatman's bank which turned into Nations Bank finally into Bank of America. They make up the rules now as they go. I made a payment to one of my bills which should take a full day to process and then it will go in the next day. Nope, they charged me 35 bucks with the 24 hour rule. Never had this problem before and the people on the phone who can't speak English tell me...\"no it's always been that way\"...after explaining to them that I know better. Excuse after excuse and they don't even listen to you. Another time I made a car payment that was suppose to go through the following Monday...after I made the payment on the previous Thursday! Yeah they think I don't know how they make money holding my money in their precious bank. NO more BOA! You guys SUCK!!!!!!! Look them up on Forbes BEST-AND WORST-BANKS. http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/kurtbadenhausen\/2013\/12\/19\/full-list-americas-best-and-worst-banks-2014\/.","2308":"Earning cash back on all purchases is simply the greatest point any card company can make when trying to recruit new customers. When I learned that that was the case, I signed up right away and started using my card. Needless to say; I charge everything to this card and have not had any problems for over two years. I pay off the balance every single month and do not carry over any balances. Very good card if you need something simple, easy, straightforward, and the rewards are just a great perk!","2309":"I have been with Bank of America for over 10 years and have rather mixed feelings about them. I really like the mobile banking app and the fact that BOA has locations just about everywhere you go. I don't like that I have to pay $5 a month for a savings account that doesn't even bear interest. I really don't like when they hold back large checks for two weeks because they need to \"wait for them to go through the clearing house.\" As someone in the finance industry, I know that this process can be completed in literally seconds. BOA has never been able to explain to me why their process takes two weeks. I am in the process of switching banks as we speak.","1020":"I recently applied for a BOA core checking account. Applying for an account was fast and easy. I received my checking account number within a week, and a few days to joint my amazon payments account with this. Customer service was friendly and helpful. I haven't received my ATM card since applying, and I called to find out that Bank Of America somehow never ordered me an ATM, so by asking me all these questions, which some were private, manage to confirm some extra informations they needed in order for them to order me one. Despite this account having a fairly huge monthly fee, it shouldn't be a problem as long as I have money coming in regularly. So far so good with this company.","1022":"We just signed up for this credit card to take advantage of their low 3% balance transfer and no interest on transfers for a year. In addition to the $100 bonus for spending $500 in the first 90 days. I also love the 1, 2, and 3% rewards all the time and the no interest of the first year. I look forward to using BankAmericard for most of all of my future purchases and redeeming rewards at the end of the year for Christmas gifts! Its definitely a card I would recommend to my friends and family!","1021":"Well originally I had the campus edge checking which they automatically switched to this one. It is 12 dollars a month if you don't have a balance of 1,000 dollars or a direct deposit. I was fine with that because I wasn't getting a monthly fee when I was working, now that I am not 12 is a bit much for a checking account especially when other banks and credit unions have completely free accounts. BOA has been my bank since I opened a checking account, their customer service is great for the most part except when I had someone from India trying to help me. I do think BOA is trying to make it whereas people who don't have a lot of money find another bank. However, I do like all the ways you can interact with the bank without actually having to go to the bank. I like to get my receipts e-mailed to me to save paper and load it into an excel sheets to keep track of it.","3467":"Decent Bank of America is what you would expect from a large bank: plenty of locations, higher fees. I really have nothing negative to say about them, other than they can be pretty tight with extending credit or loans. Overall, it really isn't horrible.","1023":"The AAA Member Rewards Credit Card seems like a good credit card. I normally dislike point based rewards, because I have a Capital One credit card and reward points are definitely not worth it. But getting extra points on groceries and gas is an appealing offer. This card also seems unique in that you can get exclusive AAA rewards such as travel and car repairs. Having money or credit that you can use for car repairs is always a good thing, because you never know when you might need it! If it was a card I used often, and was able to redeem the AAA vouchers, it would feel like a nice safety net in case of emergencies.","1024":"I wish the credit cards I have had the perks of this one. Right now I have a Capital One card and I only get Reward Points, which aren't useful for anything. The $100 bonus cash and cash back on purchases (especially the groceries one) on the BankAmericard seem very rewarding. The interest rate after 1 year seems fair and similar to most credit cards. Overdraft protection is always a good thing as well. If I'm ever in the market for another credit card, I will definitely consider this one. My only downside is I don't have a Bank of America bank account to receive the cash back, but using it as a statement credit would be useful as well.","3468":"Camden best bank I am surprised to see such bad reviews, I have had only great service from Bank of America. Excellent customer service.I was at Bank of America in Camden ,N.J I meet the bank manager Tracy. I had the best customer service from Tracy. Good customer service is treating customers with a friendly hand, helping the customer right away, giving the customer all of your attention, answering all of their questions, and also be respectful even if they're not respectful to you.Good customer service means helping customers efficiently, in a friendly manner. It's one of the things that can set your business apart from the others of its kind.","3469":"The Best and The Worst Bank of America has a great customer service if you're calling the 800 number, but walking inside the bank and talking to customer service can be a different story. In my experience I have come across a few impolite and rude workers, this could be due to location.  Bank of America has a great web\/mobile site that I trust. I trust its security more than some of the other banks like Farmer's Bank.  This bank worked with me to get me the best checking and when I was struggling at first to stay in the black they put limits so that I couldn't overdraw. Not all banks do that.","1027":"The fees on The Bank of America MyAccess checking account are pretty high, with a high threshold to avoid the $12 monthly fee. I had this account a few years ago and did not keep it long. The overdraft charges are piled on and i once received 3 overdrafts for a charge that was broken up into separate payments by them. The only positive is they have locations everywhere near me but the fees got to be too much.","1026":"Bank of America to me has always been kind of a stuck up bank. They charge high fees and high overdraft fees. They are able to do this because they are one of the top banks in the game. I left this bank years ago because they seem to make up policies as they go, i have never been able to resolve a issue with them in a way i saw as fair to me. The only plus is that they have locations everywhere but i rather pay the ATM fee of using another bank than bank with these guys again.","1025":"We have been with BOA for over ten years. We started out with student accounts when we were in college and we our now enrolled in the MyAccess Checking. The number one thing that I LOVE about BOA is the mobile banking. We don't deal with a lot of checks anymore, as we have money directly deposited, but we occasionally get them and we don't even have to go to a bank. Not that there isn't a bank anywhere we go! We live in Charlotte, NC and there are BOA's everywhere, but we don't even have the hassle of driving up to the teller anymore. We just scan the deposits from our iPhone and the money is deposited. Way to go BOA, you have always been upfront with the technology. The only reason I gave 4-Stars is because sometimes when I have had to call the customer service number I have got a few different responses or felt like the people I talked to couldn't always answer my questions. But that is few and far between!","1028":"I used this checking account only for a short time because I found that the monthly fee was extremely high, and the minimum balance requirement to avoid the monthly fee was too high for me as well. I was just out of college at the time and working at a low paying job. Although I like the Bank of America credit card that I used several years later very much, the checking account was just not the right match for me at the time. I should have taken more time to find a suitable checking account, and I believe the representative who assisted me did not have my best interests at heart as well. Years later when I had a better job this might have been a suitable card for me.","3470":"Bank of America is terrible Bank of America is terrible. I closed out an account with Bank of America and withdrew all of the money from the account, however the bank waited to close the account and charged me an insufficient funds fee. I do not think this should be legal, this bank is full of crooks and no one should ever use them, but the government will just keep giving them money so that they can continue to abuse us. When I called customer service to figure out what was going on the person was quite rude and blamed me for their fraudulent actions, its like they are trained to never take responsibility for their actions.","1029":"This has been a good card for me, although the customer service which comes with it has by far been what sets it apart from my other cards\/experiences. It takes awhile to rack up enough points for rewards to kick in, but travel rewards are only one vein of rewards available with this card, so I can't complain.","920":"I have been a Bank of America checking customer for over twelve years. There have been some hick-ups along the way but the majority of my experiences with their customer service department itself has been excellent. Most recently, I had a $20 check overdraft by .25 because of the \"Keep The Change\" program deducting money from my account and me not realizing it. While the CSR I spoke to on the phone could not remove the $35 overdraft fee, I felt like I had her sympathy and even if I walked away disappointed, I was at least able to resolve the underlying problem and get \"Keep The Change\" removed so it never happened again.","921":"I have had many bank accounts through out the years so I know what it is that I want out of a bank, and Bank of America meets all the criteria for a great bank. They are attentive to my banking needs , no hidden costs, and in the event that I ever do end up needing something they immediately handle everything with excellent customer service over all I have no complaints.","922":"I've had my checking account for about five years now and although it is slightly better than other accounts I've had, it's still a typical bank. Their method for dealing with fraud charges is ridiculous and almost impossible to win. Also constantly have new debit cards sent because the old ones are compromised, which is irritating. Overdraft fees are about the same as other banks ($35). Customer service is average. I like that I can deposit checks from my phone and ATMs are prevalent.","3472":"A solid bank I have been a customer with BoA for about five years now. They were my first bank and were very kind and knowledgeable when setting up my initial accounts. Since then, I have used their customer services occasionally to deal with any problems or questions; they were always professional, courteous, and extremely helpful. They are not a perfect bank however. They do charge a fee if your account is overdrawn, even if there is more than enough funds in another account. Their credit card 'deals' are not the best and can be hard to decipher the actual package you're signing up for. Finally, their politics are not the most flavorful: they're a large, corporate organization that will do pretty much anything to stay in the black. But what corporation isn't? This is a good starter bank, but I will be switching to a credit union in the near future.","3471":"Bank of America - America's Bank I have found Bank of America to be a very convenient bank with the number of locations, and ATMs. Bank of America does have good fraud detection is willing to work through any issues that come up. Recently I had an issue and Bank of America was very helpful in reversing fraudulent charges and not assuming I was part of the problem. The issue with Bank of America is it is a large bank so you will never get the community bank feel. Their products aren't flexible and not really made for the communities they necessarily work within.","923":"I have had MyAccess Checking account for about two years now and I can honestly say that I am a very satisfied customer. I never had a problem with any transactions and whenever I visited the bank the customer service was delightful. I recommended the services to all my family and friends.","924":"Had the mistake of opening multiple accounts with BofA in 2008. That bank is the WORST! They blocked my credit cards and froze my accounts when I was in Montreal on business. Had to call a friend to pay for my return ticket back to the USA. When I arrived I CLOSED all accounts; do NOT do business with Bank of America; atrocious service. Use at your own risk.","925":"Bank of America is the best bank I ever dealt with. The customer service is second to none. The customer service is always willing to listen to your problem and help you resolve the issue either over the phone or in person. The fees can somethings be a bit of a pain, but it better to bank with a bank you trust than one that talks down to you. I can say in confidence that I trust Bank of America.","3473":"BOA Review Overall, my experiences with BOA have been quite poor. They are good in the fact that they provide many services, but are poor in a lot of aspects. They have many hidden charges that they do not really tell you about nor provide ample warning about. This makes it so you need to put more effort into doing your banking to ensure things are all good. Also their customer service is quite weak and take a long time to connect to and get a response from.","926":"I opened my Bank of America checking account about 10 years ago and have been a customer ever since. Any time I have a question or concern, someone is there to help me 24 hours a day. The only issue I have had is that my debit card number has been stolen 3 times in the last year and used in different states. However, the minute I contacted Bank of America, the issue was resolved, money replaced, and a new debit card issued with little to no hassle. I would receommend Bank of America to my friends.","928":"The Bank Americard credit card offers amazing perks. If you apply online, you get $100 cash rewards after making $500 in purchases within the first 90 days. This is a great card if you have a large purchase planned in the near future. The APR of 12.99-22.99% is reasonable and comparable to other credit cards that I have. While I do not have this specific card, I do have a different card through Bank of America and their customer service is wonderful.","929":"The AAA Member Rewards card looks to be a good and useful card to have. The ability to use the reward points for everyday expenses like gas, car repairs and even cash back is a major benefit. Few credit cards are so flexible with their reward points. Its reward system that allows cash the flexibility of cash back is similar to my Chase Freedom card, I ca use my rewards for cash or gift cards. The fees and APR seem to be relatively standard to most credit cards, making it an easy choice if comparing cards. There is no annual fee, which is a major plus. Overall, this is a good card to have, I will be getting one soon.","927":"I love this credit card. The service is great, the APR is low, and the benefits are wonderful. I first opened the card to transfer a balance from another card and the low APR helped me pay off my card faster. I love logging on to see how many points I have earned!","1610":"i think this TRAVEL card requires the Highest Excellent Credit from all the B O A cards, NOT everybody will be able to get it, i DON'T like that i can only get the rewards towards TRAVELING expenses, i want CASH!...","1611":"The BankAmeriCard Visa Cash Rewards is Great, if You Apply Online it gives you $100 if you spend $500 in the first 3 months, has NO annual fee, it gives you 0% interest for 1 year, you also get 1% Cash Back on Purchases Unlimited and 2% for Groceries and 3% for Gas for the first $1,500 of every 3 months or 6,000 a Year, and if you have a Checking or Savings with them, you get an extra 10% Cash bonus reward, it is a Visa, so it is more accepted than any American Express or Discover Card, The downside side is your FICO has to be 750 although some people get approved with less than that........i think The BankAmeriCard is #1, American Express #2, Capital One #3 and Chase #4 when it comes to Cash Rewards, Although now Chase gives an extra 10% Cash Bonus Rewards when you have a Checking with them...","1612":"i like the B O A Cash Reward Card better than this one....","1613":"The rewards buildup is very easy and even with regular spending you can earn rewards quickly. Credit limit can go up quickly.","1614":"I applied for the travel rewards card to use while living overseas (Japan) for one year. It seemed like a good deal at the time. Beware when you try to use it overseas! When I arrived in Japan it worked fine for a couple weeks. Then one day I tried to make a small purchase of about $15 and it was declined. Went to another store and the same thing happened. I contacted B of A and was told that the card was declined because the amount was inconsistent with my previous purchase patterns. What??? I had only used the card for about 2 weeks at that point. Are my purchasing patterns established in a two week time frame? I asked for the restrictions to be removed and was told it was impossible. I would have to call each and every time the card was declined. Ridiculous. The support that I received was totally inadequate and given that I was overseas I was not able to call easily to talk to someone who could fix the problem. A major pain in the neck..","3474":"Student Account I recently opened a student account with Bank of America after having an account with my small-town, local bank since age 12. Overall, I am very satisfied with the new account and all of the online and mobile banking capabilities that go along with the Bank of America experience. It is now much easier to manage and transfer funds between my accounts on the go, a priority for a frugal college student.","1619":"Bank of America's basic checking account is great. I have been a member for over 10 years and throughout my membership, they've been head and shoulder above the competition when it comes to innovative technology. They were one of the first I can recall that allowed ATM deposited checks, and it is fantastic!","1618":"I love my Bank of America checking account. Their customer service is great! They are very approachable in the branches. My account is a student account, I have not been a student in quite some time but their banker advised me that I could upgrade my account or just keep the one I have and be \"grandfathered\" in without paying the monthly fee they now charge. I just decided to leave it alone and keep the account as is and make no changes and they were very sweet about it! Their communication is awesome!","1617":"Bank of America could have a phenomenal checking account if it weren't for one major thing for me. The number one problem is with customer service. It literally takes 10 minutes to go through the drive through for something even as simple as depositing cash into the account. The things they do well though, they do extremely well such as fraud protection. I have had a soft hold on my card twice because of possible fraud usage. All that was needed was a simple phone call to clear it up and the one time there was a charge that was not mine, it was returned to my account before I had even noticed it was missing. Also, the turnaround time for things like check deposits or bank transfers from things like PayPal is very quick with BoA.","1616":"I've had this account for over ten years; it was the first account I had. This is Bank of America's basic checking product, and I wouldn't really recommend it except that Bank of America is everywhere and has some nice features: $10 ATM machines, instant deposit of checks from the store-branch ATMs, 100 instant credit to your account from the deposit.The downsides: it is basically nearly impossible to avoid the monthly $12 fee. This account also used to be notorious for obscene overage charges, but changes to banking law since 2010 have made this account less obnoxious - in that you can turn the overdraft \"feature\" off now so your debit card will bounce if you can't cover the cost. Prior to this, every overage would be charged $35, even if you say, went over by .5 cents.Also, the cost to refill your paper checkbook is astoundingly $35. For paper checks!The meh: Bank of America is heinously zealous about protecting you from identity theft. Which is great - unless you travel a lot. On multiple occasions I have informed BoA of my travel plans only to have them shut down my account once I'm on the trip. Doesn't matter where you go - it happened once in Denver and once in Paris. Which, since this is my primary checking account, is no good at all, especially because getting your account reactivated requires calling a stateside 1-800 number between 9-5pm Eastern time. Enjoy figuring out how to do THAT when you're halfway across the world.If you absolutely MUST use Bank of America, then this is a good product despite those downsides for BoA's convenience and reliability. But otherwise I would advise against it.","1615":"I have myaccess checking account for a couple of years now, five years i believe. I wasn't kin on a bank of america checking account because of the stories of the crazy fees that i have heard. When I eventually did, I like it. My friend has it and i needed to send money to him every so often, There aren't crazy charges or fees as i had anticipated but when i bought an air ticket on vacation outside the country with my debit card, i was slammed with ridiculous fees. I called the moment i got back and it was reversed. By and large the checking account works for me.","770":"My Bank of America checking account almost always performs the way it should. However, when there's a problem, there's REALLY a problem. My last large issue is that my debit card was voided by the bank more than a year before it expired, however I never received the debit card they sent out to replace it. As a result, I ended up having a late payment on my credit card with them because they would not receive an electronic payment from my student credit union. After having gone to the bank they explained that, had the debit card been stolen, I would not have been liable for any charges against my account but had no explanation for why they would send out another debit card without notifying me.Thankfully it only took one hour of waiting and nearly forty-five minutes speaking with a person inside the bank, something that I am always wary of doing because they are within their rights to charge me for such a service because of how this account is set up, to right the late payment as well. After all, I informed them that I had initiated the payment with my CU nearly two weeks before so that it wouldn't be late.All in all, it does the job. But BofA is not without their headaches.","771":"So far my time with Bank of America has been great. I move around a lot so I needed a national chain for a bank account. The only very frustrating experience I had with them is they canceled my card on me when I made a bunch of orders. I deposited money into my bank account and ordered a bunch of stuff basically draining my account. I got a letter and an email telling me my card was canceled and to visit a location to get another. It wasn't that big of a deal as it was more annoying than anything, but it's better safe than sorry.","773":"I love bank of america! Signing up was clear and easy. Everything I needed to remember was printed and placed in a folder for me to take. I absolutely love the keep the change program, it actually really helps me save because I use my debit card for everything but I never touch my savings. Those pennies really add up! The customer service was amazing and any questions I ever have are answered quickly and efficiently. Wouldn't bank anywhere else.","772":"My Bank of America Checking Account is quick, efficient and free (as long as I keep over the $5,000 minimum.) I would give it 5 stars but I did have one issue with them. I deposited a check, only to have it denied 3 weeks later because of a small rip in the right hand corner. This caused my balance to go under $5,000 and i was hit with a monthly fee. I was able to get the check back and redeposited and was also able to get the fee reversed, but it was a hassle. I give them 4 stars, and will continue to use them in the future.","774":"We have been customers of Bank of America for almost 9 years. We have had a checking, savings and at one point a mortgage loan with the institution. We like how atm's are easy to find when traveling. The fees were minimal. We like the keep the change option. The only disappointment we had was our mortgage loan being sold by BofA to another institution. We liked the convenience of having everything centrally located.","775":"The BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card seems like a great card for someone who does a lot of international traveling. The rewards are great for a traveler and has a lot of perks in that area. The requirements to get this card includes having a very high credit rating, which is hard to obtain these days. Also, the late fees seem to be very high and that can be very frustrating. I have a Chase Freedom card and it also has a rewards system, that when purchasing goods you get a percentage back. With that card, though, there are a lot more opportunities to get that cash back pretty easily.","776":"This Bank of America account isn\u2019t bad for the general consumer, seeking a basic savings account.But \u2013 there are absolutely NO benefits for this type of account:there are no points, no rewards, and let\u2019s be honest\u2026 the APR \/ APY is joke.But\u2026 it\u2019s a basic account for those that need something simple.I\u2019ve had mine for years.And \u2013 it works for me.","3475":"After Banking Reform, Great Bank It should be noted I am reviewing this bank in the light of it being after new banking regulations had been put in place. Now that the government makes them automatically decline transactions, instead of allowing you to overdraw, I haven't had any issues with them. I do question whether at heart they are looking out for customers, but as far as post banking regulations, they are a great bank.","777":"When I first started looking for a savings account, I needed one I could open online that offered online banking and paperless receipts. The overdraft protection has saved me on more than once account, and it is extremely easy to report fraud if someone uses your account. Also, I have a bad habit of losing my debit cards, so it is very convenient that they are willing to send me a new one every few months for a very low price.","778":"I opened my checking and savings account together a few years ago, and I have been very pleased with my savings account, it only cost $25 to open which is very affordable and I've never had a problem with it. My favorite feature of this savings account is you can hook it to your checking and enroll in something called keep the change. When you use you card if you spend 5.80, the leftover .20 goes in your savings acct. it's an easy way to save money without even realizing it. And I also like the overdraft protection.","3476":"Bank of America falls short on customer service Bank of America can compete with any bank when it comes to technology, products and competitive rates. Their mobile banking is easy to use and they have multiple offices that make banking convenient. That being said they also charge convenience fees for actually using their branch locations too much. When calling their 800 number I encounter long wait times and I'm often give different answers from each customer service rep when asked the same question. From my experience their customer service reps have been less than friendly and I feel more like a bother than a customer. Overall the technology wins my service since I don't require much personal interaction with Bank of America employees.","779":"I like that this AAA Member Rewards Credit card's gives rewards on the things most people consider simple, yet very necessary like gas and groceries. Moreover, this card offers better benefits compared to others I've used in the past. One example is the American Express credit card that I used in the past which really had a high maximum amount i had to spend in stores in order to be eligible for a reward. This card seems offers good benefits and I will be getting one in the future.","3477":"Bank of America My first banking experience was and continues to be with Bank of America; I have a student checking account and a savings account with BofA that costs me no monthly fees. Their touch-screen ATM software is awesome, and the machines always read my checks. No matter where I move to in the U.S. there is always a BofA branch\/ATM nearby. Their web site is well designed and informative as well. My only complaint are the fees for over-drafts and such, but typically one can resolve their issues with BofA by going in and talking to someone at a branch and explaining the issue.","2170":"I have recently started banking with Bank of America with multiple products. My experience so far has been good in reference to the application process and customer service. I hope it continues that way in the near future as well.","2171":"I applied online. I received my 15K bonus miles within 2 weeks of using the card. I was surprised to learn that this card has so many beifits (see the benifits of the world mastercard) Most were not advertised on the spirit air site. I called the Master Card support number 1-800-307-7309, and was given an opportunity to speak with the World Mastercard Concierge, I spoke with someone in benifits and obtained a long list of benifits of the World Mastercard. Here is the link for the World Mastercard benifits:http:\/\/www.worldcard.mastercard.com\/content\/world\/ap\/en\/experiences-offers\/travel.htmlI have not used any of the benifits yet.I agree using the miles requires a very flexible schedule and very early planning. I scheduled round trip air to Costa Rica (From Fort lauderdale, FL) in May of 2015 for 5,000 points per person. (value of $300\/person, but requires a fee of $23\/person each way making it worth $254 per 5000 miles or about 5 cents per mile) The available 2500 point flights made me either go a day shorter or a day longer than I wanted to go, but for 5000 miles and $46 for the round trip, I made it work.","2172":"One of the problems with this card is that it has a high interest rate even for those who have near perfect credit. The other major PITA about this card is that should you slip up and miss paying the balance off in full within the grace period, there is a minimum finance charge each month of $10.00. I charged something for $5 then forgot the grace period was 20 days and not 30 when I paid it off in full before the closing date imagine my surprise when I was fined twice what the original charge was, just for the privilege of using Bank of Satans crappy card. If I wasn't concerned about it negatively affecting my near perfect credit score because I have had this card forever I would cancel it in a heartbeat. Much better cards out there with better rewards and less screw you gotcha's. YMMV","3478":"Meh, BOA. To start off, I didn't want Bank of America. I had to go with them while I was living in a rather large city. I wanted a private local credit union, but I couldn't get accepted until I had lived here at least three months. So I was off for three months with BoA. At first they seemed okay, but I got monthly fees that I did not like, and they took off some fees for god knows what. Their customer service was okay, but the biggest thing I hated was how they took my money and never mentioned it. You won't earn anything being at this bank, all they will do is rob you blind. Go somewhere else, if you have to bank here, make sure it's for a small amount of time or else they will steal everything you have. Be safe about Bank of America.","3479":"My initial Bank account opening in US I just reached US 7 months bank...Initially when I came I was in a confusion to choose which bank for opening an account. I just walked in to nearby some bank but didn't get attracted by their services \/ benefits. When I went to BOA, I was pleased with their services. X person came and directed me with their available benefits , explained me about debit , credit card facilities and everything happened in no time that I opened an account there , got done with all formalities...Though it is bit far from where I live, I opened an account in BOA...","2173":"When I first applied for this card, there was an annual fee, and even though it says there isn't one now, I'd be skeptical. I get charged $60 every year, even if it's been empty for a long time. This was my first card, and I got it right when I graduated college. They gave an 18 year old a $4000 credit line, which I feel was irresponsible not only for me, but for them. On top of all that, my credit score is good, and I still have an APR of 14.99%, which they've never reviewed and tried to lower. Over the course of 10 years that I've had this card, they've also never once considered raising my limit.","3480":"Pleasant I have always had pleasant experiences with my bank. There were a few times I mistakenly overdrew my account and I called and they were really nice as a courtesy to remove overdraft charges. That lets me know they go above and beyond the call of duty and truly appreciate my service. The customer service both in the branch and on the phone has always been cordial as well. They hire I believe nothing but the best and thats what makes me proud to be a customer of Bank of America.","3481":"Fees My bank punishes me for not having enough money. If my checking account falls below a certain number, they fine me a monthly charge. I recently lost my job and every dollar counts. The twelve dollar a month \"service charge\" is my food for a week. This rule upsets me very much. Unfortunately there is not much I can do because my new job direct deposits my money\u00a0into that account. Oh well. I guess will keep banking with them.","2174":"I opened a savings account through BofA as soon as I opened my checking account and I haven't had one issue with either accounts. I started my savings as a students so I didn't have a lot to fund it but their $25 minimum requirement is very easy to meet monthly. At the time, I received an extra $100 incentive to open my savings account and was very glad I did so. There are no hidden fee's with the account and I am even able to use my savings for overdraft protection of my primary checking account which has come in handy a few times already. I am very glad I chose BofA to bank with with for savings and checking.","2175":"This mileage program stinks!!!!!!! I had almost 1million miles in 2002 and have only been able to use under 200,000. Every time I book, there are no seats. Back in 2010 I tried to book some flights to Turkey. No seats for my date. So I extended my search to a 6 week time span for my date to ANYWHERE in Europe only to be told there were no seats available at all. I can't begin to guess how many times I've tried to redeem my miles with no luck. Not to mention the many many hours trying to use my points. Latest attempt\/refusal....that was today. The saga continues.Needless to say I've switched my plan to capital one and thus far have had no issues. Also no problems with my American Express card of 30 years or my Wells Fargo card.....only with Alaskan Airlines. I strongly suggest not getting this plan.","2177":"Ok for the Cheapo.... If you work the Math the signup bonus equals about $124 ish, enough for a 1 way ticket with a small bag and no drink.... Assuming you travel during a peak time of the year like summer. I est. 121 miles are equal to about $1 spent at Spirit. After the 1st year you would have to charge about $3600 to cover the $59 annual fee. Still not a bad deal if you don't mind dealing with Spirit Airlines and you are willing to make sure you make charges every 90 days or less (to avoid loosing your earned miles). Some points with Spirit airlines.. You can NOT cancel your ticket after 24 hr without paying a huge fine.... Generally about $115 or more dollars.... You have to pay to get an assigned seat. $5 to $15 or you get what you get (not a big deal), You have to pay for baggage... Anything bigger than a purse or small backpack... Don't try to bring you 20\" roll on bag to the gate without paying ahead of time... They'll charge you $100 after they start loading the plane. If your not sure about your bad, ask at the gate attendant before they start loading... Carry on or Check in bags are about $47 +\/- a few bucks each way if purchased a head of time. Add it when you purchase your flight. You can print your boarding pass at a kiosk by the baggage check-in or online. Don't do it at the counter or they will charge you. Don't call or they will charge you more, just make the changes online. I est. you can earn something around 1.5% with this card, but you need to make sure Spirit has flights that you would like to take. There are not many places I would fly from this airline. Not sure I would want to take a long fight, but the short ones are alright. I figured I would try the card out for a year and see how it goes. Off season you can fly for much less and you could easily get a round trip or several round trip tickets with the 15000 miles. Good luck and read the fine print on Spirit's website. Family and Friends if you're interested then let me know, I can send you the 15k bonus info and I'll make 5k for my troubles. Thanks for reading..","2176":"Spirit takes a very very long time to apply the 15,000 bonus, because it has been almost 2 months since I have started using the card. Other credit card companies for example Barclay automatically updates miles and bonuses. This is not a customer friendly company, because you can never get to speak to a customer service rep about the issues, you only speak with the machine...terrible...horrible. If you ask me, try Barclay arrival card, their services are much better, and they offer similar benefits","2178":"I enjoy the MyAccess checking because I do 99% of by banking through direct deposit, online, or at an ATM. We can use a teller if needed, but generally it's never required. We get all the perks of the higher tier checking accounts without the huge fees, huge minimum balances, or credit requirements. I love B of A!","3482":"Very bad experience I have been banking with Bank of America for quite some time and am counting down the days to closing my account. They charge fees for any little thing you do. Their overdraft protection is filled with fees, basically doing the opposite of what it is intended for. I absolutely hate this bank and cannot wait to end my relationship with them. The customer service is not the worst but there are many things they cannot help with or are not willing to.","1861":"After doing business with this branch for nearly 20 years now, I have come to trust and respect Bank of America for all my banking needs. The customer service is polite and knowledgeable, deposits are initiated quickly, transactions are posted to my account promptly, and any disputes I have had with them over the years has been handled with accuracy and timely results. I trust any checking system that Bank of America offers. This particular checking service is worth the little extra in fees. You will have the confidence of knowing your information is secured.","1860":"I have had my Bank of America, MyAccess Checking Account for about 8 years now. I enjoy the account and am happy with the service on the account. The only thing that I do not like on the account is the fee that is charged if there is no direct deposit during a month. When I was on maternity leave and not receiving income I was charged for each month that I did not have a check direct deposited. Other than that I am satisfied with the account and benefits of the account.","2179":"I like that this card offers bonus points by signing up, but it has a transfer fee. None of y credit cards have had transfer fees in the beginning.","3483":"Too Big To... Care About Customers Yes, Bank of America may be one of the largest in the world, but that does not give it the excuse to be terrible to its customers. Matter of fact, if it wants to retain this reputation and position, it should be one of the best in terms of service. This wasn't my experience at all. Not only does Bank of America have terrible rates, it's employees just do not care. For them, just working there is enough; the customer does nothing for them. Even when I decided to cut off my services, the employee's last words to me were, \"You'll be back.\" Really? How arrogant.","1862":"Its a standard credit card. The rates aren't too high but they aren't spectacular either. I mean its not like 30% apr with a huge annual fee but the fees and rates still aren't excellent. The rewards are nothing to rave about either. Bank of America seems to be satisfied with an adequate product and surprisingly so am i. It is not because i have low expectations but because most credit cards are crappy and a hassle. I would prefer it to have more variety and quality with respect rewards but not if it makes my life more difficult. This one may not be great but its alright and clearly not a hassle. Its a mediocre product frills free product that won't save you a bunch of cash or take up too much of your time or energy. There are no best features its all just middle of the pack.","1863":"I just signed up for this card after doing some quick math about the rewards offering. It is a no-brainer. I've been a BOA banking customer for about 15 years. A few years ago, they offered $600 to open an investment account with ML Edge, so I did. Three days ago, I logged into my BOA account and they said I qualified for benefits as a Preferred Rewards Platinum Honors Client, which included a 75% bonus to their credit card awards. So, for this BankAmericard Travel Rewards, for every dollar spent, I earn 1.5 standard points + 75% bonus + 10% bonus points = 2.89 points\/dollar minimum. That beats my Chase Sapphire Preferred and my Barclaycard Arrival which pays 2.14 points\/dollar including their redemption bonus. And the BankAmericard are free with no annual fees! I signed up for the Cash Rewards one too just for Gas and Groceries since it effectively pays me 5.78% on gas and 3.85% on groceries, 1.93% on all others. And both of them give you $100 statement credit after spending 500$ in the first 90 days. These two new cards are now without a doubt, the best credit cards I have. It's amazing to see BOA offering such great rewards on their credit cards.","1865":"I have had this account for years, including when i was in college. I have had no problems with Bank of America, and in some cases they have taken care of me when i had a problem with a company automatically deducting unauthorized payments out of my account. In this situation they were on my side and helped me to get my money back and even refunded all fees they had charged me. I never have had a problem with a customer service rep and I could recommend this bank\/checking account to anyone.","1864":"I have Bank of America checking account for 7 years and have never wanted to switch banks. I began with a student checking account and have worked up to add credit lines and savings accounts with BoA.A year ago when my wallet was stolen along with all my checking account information, BoA resolved the problem by canceling my old card number, overnighting me a new debit card and changing my account numbers within 15 minutes. I felt safe and had great customer service.","1866":"I like that there is a $100 bonus for using the card the first couple of months. I also like the 25 day grace period, but I don't like that there is no image of what the card looks like on the page.","1867":"I like that the card gives you 2 points used per $1 on gas. I don't like the color or image on the credit card itself, it's really kind of ugly.","1868":"I had always heard that Bank of America was the worst company ever, and I picked up an account with them because it was the primary account of the university I attended--I was always afraid to overdraw for an onslaught of fees, but when it finally happened, they just waived it off like it was no big deal.I have had no issues with this account--I love it: simple and effective for my needs, and I recommend one to anyone who is willing to learn how it works, and simply follow the rules for a simple, yet effective account.","1273":"I've had the Money Market Savings account for about 3 years now and I can't stress how much I love it compared to my other savings accounts. Bank of America has been my go to bank as far as savings go because the minimum requirements to maintain the account are probably the best in the industry, With my Credit Union, the only way you can even apply for a money market savings account is if you meet a ridiculous balance. Sure, the interest rate is a little higher, but I like that with Bank of America you have other options that keeps your savings account free such as having a mortgage or maintaining a reasonable balance between numerous accounts.","1869":"Bank of America has always been good to me. Whenever I have a problem with my account, they are just one phone call away and there is a zero waiting time to speak to an associate. I have a checking, savings, and car loan account with them. As a student, it is very important for me to receive alerts on the balance of each of these accounts. Bank of America always sends me texts or emails, which allow me to know the status of each of my accounts. I think it would be wrong of me as a student to pick any other bank!","1272":"The checking account at Bank of America has a lot of advantages over other banks because of the large number of ATMs available. I can deposit cash or checks easily or even deposit a check by using my smartphone. These features make online check banking so simple.However, customer service and the fees they charge are outrageous so you have to be careful when using this bank. I was charged $12 for a returned check that wasn't mine. I don't see how I am responsible for making sure someone else does not write checks that bounce. I should have not been charged for an error that wasn't mine. Customer service would not waive this fee.","1271":"The Bank of America savings account was easy to sign up for online. It only took a couple of minutes. I liked that you can sign up and easily transfer money from your checking account to your savings account. This helps a lot of if your checking account balance is low. You can transfer money from your savings account to your checking to avoid any over draft fees.There are also settings on the online banking site that allow you to have the bank send a notice when your balance is getting low. This helps avoid fees as well. You can also transfer money to other Bank of America users. I have a college age student. When she needs money, I just go online and transfer money to her account. The savings account helps me keep her up to date as well.","1270":"I opened this account to replace one i had with a previous bank. it has serve me well. I have manage to perform banking transactions online, which is more than what I hoped for. The downside? it pays very little interes, so you are better served in some other type of account if good interest rates is what you are lookng for. (good luck with that one). But, for a regular user of banking services, this account serves very well and, at $5.00 per month, i find it a very good deal.","3484":"Review: Bank of America I have been a loyal customer for this particular bank over 10 years and counting. i have not had any issues with my information being lost, with my money transfers. everything goes smoothly when i do have issues that need attention. i am able to make contact with customer support frequently if needed. my bank statements are provided with all the relevant information. in person encounters are very helpful and informative if i do have any questions.","1274":"The BankAmericard Cash Rewards credit card is great for anyone, with a great cash back reward system a great customer service base there is much you could ask for. Since it is a credit card depending on your credit this card can have a pretty low APR which is great because no one wants to pay interest. There is not much wrong with this card so my advice would be to apply","3485":"Medallion Signature Guarantee BOA is no longer offering this service at any of their branches, even if you have an account with them. If you have a brokerage account at Merrill Lynch they \"might\" be able to work out something.","1275":"this is the worst card I have ever had. I pay my bill on line with auto pay and my card is still denied when I try to use it. I am paying this off and NEVER using it again. I will never recommend it to anyone, not even my dog. that bank of America sucks too, since there the ones who control it.","3486":"Decent I've never had any major problems dealing with Bank of America. I've only dealt with their customer service a handful of times and my problem has always been resolved promptly and to my liking. I also do most of my banking at ATMs when I need to use their services and I've always found them to be very easy to work. When I have to talk to someone, the employees are nice and helpful. The drive-throughs are nice too because they can be more convenient than parking and going inside. Also, they often give out candy if you have kids in the car and dog biscuits if you have dogs with you.","3487":"Pretty good bank This bank is pretty good, in terms of providing access and customer service. I wanted a simple checking account that would allow me to add and withdraw money easily. This bank does that, providing a lot of options with ATM's and overall great service. The overdraft fees are little expensive, but not as bad as they used to be.","1276":"I have had this credit card for over a year and honestly I could not be happier. When I make an out of the ordinary large purchase the \"freeze\" my account until I verify the purchases which may be slightly inconvenient but I would much rather have my card secure than have my money stolen from me. I love the reward system and the customer service is always top notch.","1278":"I keep this card and use it sparingly. I appreciate the deals on APR that they periodically offer. I've transferred a couple of my higher interest rate cards onto this one. The last offer I was sent included an option for a low interest rate with no transfer fee. The checks they sent really came in handy when I went on vacation. I knew I'd only be paying 4.99% through 2015 -- by which time that $500 will long be paid off. They are very consistent with their customers and don't throw any charges in out of the blue. I've been with them for several years.","1277":"Overall, my experience has been positive. I generally have had good customer service with Bank of America regarding this card. They have been pretty good about keeping me in the loop about potential fraudulent charges. It has been easy to contact them when I have questions. I do like that you get extra rewards for groceries and gas, since those are essential items that I have to buy anyway. It is very easy and seamless to use this card if you already have a Bank of America account. If you redeem your rewards into a Bank of America account, you even get extra rewards. I do also like being able to check my balance on the online banking website or on the smartphone app. This card is very convenient.","3488":"Good online banking I have been a customer of Bank of America for approximately ten years. With them I have held a savings and checking account. They unfortunately don't have branches closer than 20 miles from where I live, but the online banking and customer service has been great. The biggest downside is fees. Overall, I recommend this bank.","1279":"Really a rather standard credit card. The interest rates, late fees, cash advance fees and reward points accumulation is very similar to my Capital One Quicksilver card. However, the reason I give this card a 4th star over a 3 star rating is the 10% customer bonus points on total purchases with a Bank of America account! the maximum penalty APR is 29.99%, which I find a little excessive, but pay the bill on time and no worries.","520":"I signed up for a Bank of America savings account after seeing a commercial for the Keep the Change program and the promotion for a 100 % match by BofA for the first three months (it is a 5 percent match after the promotion ends). The promotion matched up to $250. Who could pass that up? What the program does is round up your debit card purchases to the next dollar, and the excess amount goes into savings (for example, from a $5.10 purchase, $6 will be deducted from checking and $.90 will go into your savings account.What I did to make sure to reach my match is to go grocery shopping late at night, when there are no crowds, and use the self-checkout to ring items separately or in pairs to make sure that I reached the $250 match. I think I ended up around $230, which was great and kept me as a Bank of America customer. I also really like how you can customize alerts, such as if a deposit has come through or if the amount has dipped below an amount that you can preset. I have a BofA checking account too and transfer $25 from checking to savings every month, which means there is no fee for the savings account. Great all around deal.","521":"I have been a Bank of America customer for years, I have the checking account and the savings account. It is simple enough to transfer money from my checking to my savings which is great but the interest I am accruing is very very minor and Bank of America has a lot of rules. Your balance must always be above $300 or you get a monthly fine, and you may not withdraw from your savings more that 3 times in a statement period or you will get a fine. I am sure there are others I have just never come across yet.","522":"I hated having this account. The fees were insane, and the overdrafts are calculated in such a way that it would maximize the overdraft charges. When I asked about this, they said they order it that way because they assume the largest debits are the most important, and that they should get deducted first. This is BS because they pay the overdrafts anyways! So glad I've moved on from this soul-less corporate greed.","523":"The guaranteed 1% cash back on every purchase is my favorite feature of this credit card. The schedule of fees is reasonable and I'm motivated to use the card for most purchases, especially food and gas, due to the increased cash back. Right after getting the card I had to buy repairs for my bicycle and earned the $100 cash rewards bonus, which was very competitive and was helpful. I have not used the card for loans or international purchases, and have not had to communicate with customer service. However, Bank of America has provided good customer service when I have had to contact them about my other accounts, so I would feel comfortable contacting them about this card. I honestly don't think there are better options out there.","524":"I think the intro rate on transfers is high as well as the regular rate. My capitalone card is 0% for the first 6 months","525":"I opened up my Bank of America Cash Rewards credit card a few years ago. I immediately took advantage of the 12 month 0% on balance transfers and purchases. I have utilized the online account management website on a monthly basis and find it user friendly. On the rare occasion that I do need to call customer service, I am able to successfully navigate the phone menu and the service representative is friendly and accommodating. I have not had any major issues with this credit card and would recommend it to anyone.","527":"The BankAmericard Cash Rewards\u2122 Credit Card is amazing because of the 1%,2% and 3% cash back despite the fact that they have a limit on how much cash back you can earn, the limit is reasonable and there 1% is for every transaction. Nothing beats this offer because you can earn cash back as you spend on regular things you cant avoid like gas and groceries.","526":"I have never had an issue with bank of America and I have been a customer for eight years and love them. The only time I have ever had an issue was when my student account changed without my knowledge to a new account and then began to have fees for balance and other hidden things. After a few phone calls it finally was resolved and fixed. I think it really just depends on the rep that you get at that moment. For the most part they are always helpful. I have realized if the rep isn't helping you just asked to be transferred to someone else because they aren't meeting your standards or understanding what you need to be done.","528":"The Bank of America Savings account is ok. They charge the normal fees that banks charge, and have a low interest rate. I have never had a problem with their customer service in the branches, but I rarely call their 800 number because I don't like to wait on hold which is typical. Other than that, I would recommend the account because they are a national company with branches everywhere you go, which is easy if you travel a lot like my family does.","1790":"I run a small individual business and it was easy to add a business account to my personal profile. I went in person and the customer service was friendly, helpful in answering my questions and would always take the time to help me out when I had any issues with my account after I had signed up. It's really great to be able to go online and find all my account information in one place with my other accounts. The fees are low and I do try to keep my balance fairly high so I don't get penalties, but that's pretty easy to check with the mobile app on my phone too. When I do find fees that I don't understand, like foreign fees, the customer service is really helpful and a big plus is they'll waive them most of the time, if it's your first time, which I think is really nice. Overall, it's been a very easy and smooth checking account to handle.","3489":"Bank of America is a good bank tio work with!! I've been with Bank of America for several years. There's only one time I can count that ive had an issue with them. Once I had acidentally over drafted my account by $7. A few days later they charged me $39.99. That same week they charged me 2 more $39.99 fees. They did remove 2 of them leaving me with only $47 having to pay them. They were able to fix my account in one phone call. Overall banking with them has been great. My direct deposit from my job is in the bank before most of my co-workers. That in itself is very nice.","3490":"Overdraft hell For the most part my experience was pretty middle of the road, but at one point with this bank I was allowed to overdraft seven times before I found out that I didn't have any funds available. Every other bank that I've been with before has processed one overdraft payment and then put a block on the card, but with this bank I was allowed to run up over $200 in fees, not counting what I owed just for the overdrafts themselves, before I found out that I had no money.","3491":"Mediocre Bank I had a mediocre experience at Bank of America. The customer service was never bad,but was never very personal. Several times I was put in a private room to discuss account issues with a someone on the phone rather than dealing with it in person, which was awkward. I ended up switching to a local credit union for more personal service, lower fees, and to more responsibly invest my money in a more local economy.","1792":"I have been a customer for five years and their service is really great. The best part about the account is that when you meet a minimum balance requirement the fees are waived which is a great thing for someone trying to save some money. The only discouraging part about the account is that their interest rates are quite low compared to other banks which means your yield is relatively low.","1791":"I have been a customer for five years and this checking account meets all my day to day demands. The great part about is that the fees are relatively low and with a direct deposit which is available in most jobs your fees are waived there are also alot of options to exploit so as to waive your monthly fees. On the other hand, the downside of the account is that the fees are steep when you withdraw from a non-bank of america ATM. Stay away from third party ATM's and you will be a happy customer.","529":"What can I say about my BoA savings account? Well I just love it. It's very helpful and convenient for saving money with no real downside. I am allowed free transfers from my Checking to my Savings account and I can even do a transfer right on my phone in just a few seconds. I know that having a BoA Savings account is what will lead me to reach my financial goals.","1793":"I have been a Bank of America customer for more than 10 years and the best part is that the bank is pretty much everywhere. I'm not big on all the fees if you don't have a direct deposit of a certain amount set up and I don't like being pushed to get a credit card when I am there to do simple tasks. I do, however, like that Bank of America seems to be on top of technology when it comes to making deposits from your phone, multiple check and cash deposit with no envelope at the ATM, etc. The only issue I have had is a couple ATM malfunctions. Bank of America isn't quick to want to fix when something goes wrong and they acted like I was lying when I said that the machine told me it was giving me $20 but the $20 never came out. It was too much of a process to correct the machine's error.","1795":"This has been a great simple checking account. The Bank of America iPhone app lets me manage all of my money between all my account (credit card included), pay my bills, get alerts, and I have unlimited access to tellers if I need them. This is a very good, low frills program that gives you a straightforward checking solution.","1797":"About a month ago I received an email from Bank of America's fraud department regarding my checking account. I promptly called the number provided and was connected with a gentleman on the phone. He informed me that I had recently used my debit card at an establishment where data had been compromised and police were involved. Due to this they were going to have to cancel my current debit card and send me a new one. He stated that it would take five to seven business days or I could go to a local branch to get a temporary card. However, there are no branches near me, and that is my only to pay for things he offered to expedite it, he said two to three days. I was very pleased with this, and received my debit card in two days.That was until I looked at my account and was charged $15 for the debit card being expedited. The man never mentioned anything about a fee, so I used their chat now option. I have used this feature many times, sometimes I have a pleasant experience, and sometimes it does not go so smoothly. This time it was the latter. I was connected with someone who was friendly enough, but was not very helpful at first. It took about 25 minutes for her to understand that I wanted my money back because I was not informed I would be charged for the fee. After she realized this it took only a few more moments to get it approved.While I got my money back within a day, it was still very frustrating to have to go through the run around to get the money back. Secondly, I don't feel like they should offer to expedite without informing of an additional charge. Lastly, I was not given any chance to withdraw any money before the card was cancelled which was quite inconvenient.","1796":"My bank account was recently compromised, and there were several small charges on it ($5 or less) that were later reversed. I noticed the charges and called Bank of America and the customer service rep acted rude and uninterested. She said it wasn't a big deal because the charges were reversed anyway. I had to ask her several times to cancel my card and issue a new one, because regardless if the charges were reversed or not, I never authorized them. When she finally agreed, she refused to expedite the shipping of my new card, and it took two weeks for me to receive it in the mail. I was very unhappy with the experience.","1798":"The Bank of Americard was my first credit card that I got before going to college and it has been an awesome card to have. While it does have a pretty high APR it is consistent with cards in this class. It also has some of the best rewards out there with 3% Cashback on gas, 2% on Groceries, and 1% on everything else, plus you get a 25% bonus if you transfer your bonus to a BOA account. It has been a really great card with all the bells and whistles and great rewards.","1794":"I've been a Bank of America customer for at least five years now, and I can't say I've had a single bad experience with them. The one time any problems arose was when my wallet had been lost, which had by bank card in it. I was worried someone may find the wallet and use my bank card, so I called Bank of America right away. I was panicking, but the rep was really nice and took care of everything! She cancelled my card and mailed me out a new one, which got here really quick. It was such a huge relief not having to worry about someone using my card. I love my bank! :D","1640":"I really enjoy having this credit card. I get cash rewards for things I am buying anyways, how awesome is that? The interest rate is pretty low and as long as you make your payments on time you should have no issues. Customer service is pretty nice too.","1799":"I have had Bank of America card for more than three years and I am very happy with it. When the card was stolen from me in a gym, I called them, they did everything they could to protect my money and credit and issued a new car within four days. Their customer service is great. I have never ever had any problem with acceptance.","1641":"Not a fan. I got the card almost eight months ago. I received my 2,500 mile in-flight application bonus after about a month. I received the card in the mail about another month later I used the card the immediately upon receiving it, and to date, my 15,000 bonus miles have not been credited to my account. It's difficult to find information on their website. It doesn't live up to the hype they give it.","3492":"A Decent Experience I've been banking with BoA for almost five years now. Since its a major, \"big\" bank, their interest rates, fees, and other products are not as competitive as smaller online banks would offer. However, it does have a robust and overall nice mobile app and website I can use to do my banking on the go. Also, the customer service I receive at their physical branches and on the phone is quite good.","3493":"Bank of America is great Bank of America is arguably one of the biggest banks in America. They have pretty good customer service and have many different products available to every customer. They are located everywhere and usually can offer the same level of service throughout all their locations. They hold my mortgage on my house and they have always been fair with rates and they don't nickel and dime me for little charges on my checking and savings accounts. I recommend bank of america to anyone that wants a simple bank that offers a lot for your dollar.","1642":"I was toying with the idea of opening up a savings account a couple of months ago, and I decided to recently open up one. The process was really easy. I was able to open up the savings account from my phone, which is very convenient. The biggest annoyance about my savings account is the five dollar monthly fee. The fee can be waived if you maintain a daily $300 balance. The whole point of having a savings account is to save money, so I don\u2019t know why you need to pay to save your money. I\u2019m not that good at saving my money, so I felt sticking it in the bank, would be a better decision for me in the long run! I just keep my balance above $300. I just have the basic savings account for right now and I use it for saving money for my trip to South East Asia next year. My next goal is to open an interest bearing checking account and BOA has some good options for those. I\u2019m very happy with BOA for my personal banking and my savings account. The only thing that I find annoying is their fees for maintaining accounts with them. They have great customer service, and when I went into make a deposit the next time, a representative even chatted with me about my savings account. She touched base with some options that I had. It was nice to know that representatives are aware of the changes or things that you\u2019re adding to your account as a customer. My savings account is can also be used as an overdraft protection for my main account. That is a nice perk! And I have access to my balance online and through my phone app, 24\/7.","1643":"Bank of America has one of the best service representatives that I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. On multiple occasions, I have had trouble accessing funds in my account because of outside issues. They always explain the situation thoroughly, and calmly work out a solution. Also, many times, accidental overdraft fees have been worked out just by talking to them about the situation. Great staff, and great local bank.","1644":"I have had my Bank of America card for about 10 years now, and it was one of the first credit cards I owned. It was fairly easy to get considering I had little credit at the time. I had an incident with fraud charges on my card and Bank of America was able to get the charges removed, and issue a new card to me. Overall I am happy with this credit card and I would recommend it to anybody that is looking for one.","1645":"If you are getting this card base on the advertisement that you will get some free flights off the bat, keep in mind this info. Only on certain dates out of the calendar year will you be able to fly at 5,000 pts round trip. Otherwise it cost 50,000 pts to fly on any given date. The initial points they give you is not enough to fly on any given date. Only get this card if your trips are flexible.","1646":"I've had this card for almost 4 years now. Opened my first line of credit with it and I've never had any issues with it. No security concerns, no weird stuff being posted to my statements.","1647":"Solid 1.6% awards ( if you are a BoA checking customer ) on everything applicable to travel rebates ( a lot of things count as travel, including bus fares, amusment parks and other things, so its no problem finding things to use it on ). I mostly got it to save on foreign transaction fees before a trip, as I was worried my Discover It card (which I usually use) would not be as accepted as Visa abroad.It wasn't that hard to qualify IMO, maybe because I'm a BoA customer. I only had about one year of credit history at the time, my fico was somewhere around 710, I had a pretty good balance with BoA. Yea the late fee is high but BoA makes the online auto bill pay pretty easy. I think $100 is an OK sign bonus for a card with no forex fee\/annual fee.","3495":"Very friendly My working relationship with Bank of America has been extremely good! I needed an account to direct deposit my SSI check and they opened it for me when two other banks turned me down. First off I had problems with getting online banking started so I went into the bank and they was very helpful and had the online banking going for me in a short time. Also I keep a low balance because of my fixed income and when they charge their fee for this it will run my account negative. They have never charged an overdraft fee for this! It has just been a wonderful experience in every way with this bank! Customer service is fantastic!! I would recommend them to everyone!","3494":"My First Bank Honestly, you are lucky if you understand banks when you open your first bank account at the age of 16. What I did like was that Bank of America was one of the few banks that let you open it at that age. I ended up learning a lot on how bank works and how you shouldn't just sign up for all their programs. I can't review every single program, but the one I disliked the most was Overdraft protection. It's supposed to help you not overdraft but all it is a program that charges you a fee to cover money checking into saving & also will let you overdraft and charge you two fees instead of one.","1649":"Bank of America has easily became my favorite for checking account. Unlike my other bank who charges you countless fees, Bank of America does not charge any hidden checking account fees. I accidentally over drafted last week, due to pending deposits) and with just one call and one representative, my problem was fixed. That was the first time I actually had a banking problem fixed with talking to the first person ho picks up the phone. I will be canceling with my secondary bank and making this my full time banking.","1648":"Bank of America has a thoroughly professional customer service staff. I was traveling out of state a month ago, and found myself in a tight spot with money, Bank of America cleared a check for me over the phone to get me emergency cash. I have also been able to have overdraft fees voided just by talking to a polite representative. I will definitely continue banking with BOA.","1671":"The point system on this card is very good. It is very easy to accumulate points fast because they are double when you use the card for gas and groceries. There is no bonus, but the rates are great! I recommend this card! It is just as good as my Capital One card!","1670":"The thing I like about the BankAmericard Cash Rewards card is that it has a grace period of 25 days. It also gives you a $100 bonus after spending $500 on it. That is something I know I will benefit from. This is actually a card I can use.","3496":"Great Service and Web Experience I was recommended to Bank of America by a friend of mine that banks there also. The customer service was very friendly, and when I first signed up I was walked through the process in a easy, simple to understand way. Banking online is an important thing for me, so I had to make sure the web experience was up to par. Overall Bank of America is a great place for me to do my banking.","1672":"Last year I was on a mission trip overseas and I was using my Bank of America checking account Visa debit card to do most of my purchases and also on ATMs. At first I was confused about the fees I was being charged by the bank after each transaction. I contacted support and they helped me understand that when you're overseas and make a transaction, the bank charges connection fees as well as international transaction fees. An other issue was when my Visa card reached the expiration date and I had to get a new one from the bank while I'm overseas. Shipping took longer than I predicted and so I had to spend some days without any way to withdraw money or make a transaction","1673":"I start using a regular savings account from Bank of America in 2008 and have been very happy with the experience. I always find help whenever I need it and this savings account has been my solution for planning financially for my long-term projects, saving for my needs, and of course sometimes using it to top up my checking account when it's running low.","1674":"Approximately a year ago I had a Bank of America checking account. I had had the account for at least 3 years and had never had any problems with them. However, my debit card information ended up getting stolen from me and multiple charges were made via the internet from various sites. I immediately called the bank when I realized what was going on (fortunately it was the same day) and their customer service was extremely rude to me. They acted like I had gone out and willing handed someone my information and told them to go run-a-muck. It took over a week and me hounding them continuously to get everything situated. I was very upset with the whole situation and was even more upset with the way I was treated. I ended up closing out my bank account with them a couple of weeks later. It was an unfortunate incident considering I had never had any problems until that point, but I felt so disrespected that I didn't even consider giving them a second chance. Maybe it was the area I am in or the people I was dealing with, but I wouldn't recommend Bank of America to anyone.","1675":"I have been with Bank of America for about 2 years and I am always amazed by the quality of their customer service and its flexibility. Recently I got charged a monthly fee of 12 dollars, two months in a row for having a checking balance below $250. However as a 22 years old student i am not subject to this fee. They immediate accepted to waive the fee and to reimburse me the $24 dollars already charged. I got very surprised because i was expecting to have to fight to get it back. But it turns out their are willing to do whatever it takes to keep their customer and they definitly gained my loyalty","1676":"Before switching from BofA to a local credit union, I was using them for roughly 12+ years, for the longest time I always had a free checking account with them. Then within a month of switching, I would say mid to late 2010 they started assessing fees to their checking accounts. Before the fees were implemented I was very happy with the level of service I received from BofA, I was able to get free checks, anytime I went into a location or had to call a CSR rep on the phone, they were always extremely helpful in regards to my account. If it weren't for the fees they they started I would likely have a checking account with them. Though I do still have a savings with them.","1678":"I have had this card for several years now and I've never had any problems with it. It's accepted everywhere, which makes shopping easy. Any time that I have needed to talk with customer service, they have been extremely helpful and pleasant. They have alerted me several times to charges they were concerned about possibly being fraudulent charges and I value this. The company itself has been amazing to work with and they are open to arrangements and discussions. This was my first experience with a credit card and Bank of America made it so positive, that I never left. I think this is a great card to have.","1677":"If I can give it a zero star, I would. It has horrible customer service. When I called to get my points converted to NCL on board credit. I was transferred 5 times, on hold for over 45 mins. The person finally said she can help ended up lecturing me. It's ridiculous. I have never had that much trouble getting my rewards with Chase or Capital One. I learned my lesson, not all reward cards are the same. I got so frustrated I finally told them to keep all my points, I don't want to deal with them anymore. I closed the account completely on my third and finally phone calls on the same day. My time is too valuable and I am not going to be transferred and hung up on over and over again!! Bank of America you just lost an excellent customer!","1679":"I've been with BoA for about four years and have never had any problems. I can't think of any real complaints, my general experience with them has been very satisfactory. Their checking account is very simple and easy to navigate. Customer service is great. I've only recently become financially independent and tend to be clueless about basic things, but their employees are always friendly and helpful and never seem irritated or condescending. I'd say it's a great account to have for someone who is just starting out and wants something uncomplicated and easy to navigate.","1890":"Overall I am very satisfied with Bank of America, despite a lot of negative press. I run a small business and this is a good checking account for me. I never have a problem avoiding the monthly fee, I have only paid it once and that was in the early days. I also do some business overseas and the low foreign atm fee is very helpful. I can also access the account from a variety of devices including my phone which is very nice. I would recommend the account anybody who is running a small business.","1891":"I very much enjoy the no annual fee, but the late fee seems pretty high. The 24 hour assistance is a great feature, however, as well as the initial bonus of 10,000 points. A very high credit history, however, is needed to get this card.","1893":"This has been my bank for seven years. They are always friendly and understanding. Anytime I have had an issue with this company they have went over the moon to assist me and work things out. Every member of this team I have gotten to work with has been very friendly. They have a mobile app so that I can check my account on my phone. This is one of my favorite features! I would recommend this bank to anyone and many of my friends have switched to Bank of America!","1892":"What was I thinkin', oh yeah, no FTF, No AF, no fees whatsoever, what a great card-!! Kidding right? Looks like others who chimed in with less than 5 stars do NOT have this card, or does not have perfect credit history, never traveled outside the USA, or just grumpy irresponsible...never mind, that's another subject, but COME ON-!! Cannot beat this card....works for me-!!!","1899":"I have been associated with BoA for nearly an year now. I am very satisfied with their customer service levels till date. When I first got associated with BoA, I opened a Savings account too, which I subsequently went ahead and closed because I did not see much use in having it. And, while both opening and closing the savings account, the customer service desk was immensely co-operative and suggestive of pros and cons. I feel cared when I interact with Bank of America CC executives. Also, every transaction related to my checking account clears and gets processed with utmost smoothness without me having to worry about the timelines.","1898":"i currenty have a savins account with both webster bank and bank of america. i have had tons of issues with bank of america as to fees and overdrafts and all sorts of nonsense. one year i ended up paying them over $400.00 for a 12 cent overdraft that i didnt know about because i had left for vacaton. webster on the other hand has been greative had the account for 3 years and never overdrafted they dont charge me for transfers or to maintain a limit. the account was safe and i even added my fiance to my ccounts for joint accounts. he got a card and it made direct deposit and paying our bills so much easier.","1896":"I love Bank of America. I have been with them for eight years. Through this time I have never experienced any problems with them. They have excellent customer service. I always find someone available to help me or answer any questions I may have. I love the fact that there is multiple ways to get in touch with someone in customer service. They offer customer service via telephone, online chat, and face to face at any of the branches. I had a few incidents with fraud on my account and they did everything they could, so I was still able to use my card and buy the things I needed. IE: gas and groceries. They always put their customers first and resolve everything in a timely manner. They switch out my debit card as soon as there are any potential threats and although it means I have to switch all my online payments, it makes me grateful that they're protecting me and my household.","1897":"My Bank of America savings account for the most part has served me well. Anytime I have ever had an issue all I have to do is call and it usually is solved right away. They offer excellent customer service. I do wish the interest rate was higher as I am a college student and don't have enough money to open up a CD which requires higher monthly balance. It's nice that the only requirement to keep the account free is a monthly $25 dollar transfer.","1895":"I have a regular savings account at Bank of America and there have been a few issues worth noting. Be sure that you are aware of the transfer and transaction limits if you plan on occasionally moving funds from the savings account to gain cash, pay bills, or cover balances in other accounts. If you do these things too often within the thirty day statement period you will incur a series of fees for exceeding the activity limit of the account. Additionally, it is greatly beneficial to sign up for the online statements and account management to not only keep track of your progress and activity, but also as a way to limit mailings and wasteful mail.","1894":"I have had this regular savings account at Bank of America since 2007. I've never had any acute problems with it; I've never been charged any fees or anything like that. My biggest issue has been the declining interest rate alongside increasing restrictions. I'm not sure the exact rates, but my interest rate definitely used to be higher. Now, for my more than $10,000 balance, I'm getting like 8-9 cents interest per month. As well, when I opened the account, you could withdraw 6 times per month without a penalty, which is now down to just three. On the other hand, this does provided a stronger incentive for me not to touch my savings unless I absolutely have to, so that's something. On the whole though, interest rates are terrible everywhere. I wouldn't trade the convenience of having my money in BOA for any other bank right now because there partnership with Barclay's allows me to have easy and free access to my money even though I am living in London.","2101":"This card seems pretty great. Compared to most cards it has a low interest rate at 13 percent but it doesn't have high cash back interest rate like some other cards such as bank of america card.","2100":"The most serious issue that I've hard with my checking account was when my debit card's security was compromised and the bank canceled my card. However, they did so without telling me and I was absolutely infuriated. There I was, attempting to use my debit card for a transaction and they failed to inform me that I had a new card. Therefore, I was unable to access my checking account and I was forced to transfer a big chunk of my money to my other checking in another bank account to utilize it. And due to the sluggish 3 day transfer I had to use, I was essentially broke during that time period and I was a teenager alone in foreign country. The worst part was that I was abroad.However the online access definitely makes it somewhat worth all the hassle bank of America has put me through.","2102":"What I really like about this card is that it offers a $100 bonus after you spend $500 in the first 90 days. There is certainly no reward like this with my capital one venture card or any other card that I have heard of.","3497":"B of A Review I have been a customer of Bank of America since I got my very first job when I was seven years old. Initially, I signed up for an account at Bank of America because of convenience--it allowed easy transfer of money from my father's own B of A account and there was a location only a couple blocks away from my house. Recently however, I have come to appreciate B of A all the more because of the protections offered from identity theft, something I recently became a victim of. Overall, I am happy with my bank!","3498":"BOA I've been using Bank Of America (BOA) since I was about 13 years old, as it's one of the more plentiful banks here in my area. I signed up for a student checking account at that time and had a savings account along with it. A few months into using my account, I had went over the limit on my checking account after buying something at a store. The next day, I found multiple $35 fee charges to my account due to insufficient funds.  On the bright side, I got my first CC from BOA back in December of 2012 with a $300 limit. I had gotten a secured CC as I lacked a credit history and, a year later, I was given the standard card. After calling customer service, I had the card upgraded to their 3-2-1 rewards card and my CL was increased substantially to 2,000.  I'd say as long as you have a steady flow of income going into your account, your experience with BOA will be a good one.","2103":"I initially got a Bank of America student checking account and linked savings account when I began college. I choose Bank of America because it was a national bank with many branches both at home and where I was heading to school. A few months after graduation, I was no longer able to keep my student checking account. I was at first annoyed that it seemed I couldn't stay with Bank of America any more if I wanted to avoid paying a monthly maintenance fee, but I was pleasantly surprised to learn about this account option when I met with a banker at my local branch. Since I had plenty of savings already to meet the minimum requirement and a steady job, it was a simple choice to get this account. I went from thinking I was going to have to pay for my formerly free account to actually getting paid (al beit a small amount) for keeping my money with Bank of America. The interest rate is not wonderful, but it's better than the rate I get in my Bank of America linked savings account, and interest rates are pretty terrible at most banks these days. All in all, I would definitely recommend this account for anyone who wants free checking and feels comfortable enough in their finances to maintain the minimum balance.","2104":"I have had Bank of America for almost 10 years, and after having issues with them early on, I have grown to love them. It is always nice to be able to go to a bank wherever I am, and not have to worry about fees for using non-bank ATMs. Most of the time, the Customer Service is great, with only a few exceptions throughout the years. This account makes it very easy for me to have money deposited automatically, and the new transfer options really help when my family and I want to transfer money to each other.","2105":"I love Bank of America. I have been with them for about four years. Over this time I have never experienced any problems with them. They have great customer service. I always find someone available to help me or answer any questions I may have. I love the fact that there is multiple ways to get in touch with someone in customer service. They offer customer service via telephone, online chat, and face to face at any of the branches. Another great part of having a Bank of America checking account is the cash back rewards that they now offer. I highly recommend a Bank of America checking account to anyone looking to open one.","2106":"I have a personal checking account with Bank Of America. I was impressed with the customer service representative who opened my account. He was professional, friendly and competent. I have been using the account actively ever since, and I am pleased with the service. I registered the Online Banking option and it has work flawlessly with no difficulties. I am able to access my account quickly and there are many online options to take care of my needs. I hardly ever have to call customer service on the phone! I am able to review all my activities and obtain bank statements with no delays. The checking account debit mastercard also offers additional protection for transactions that might be made online. The program is called secure mastercode, and I have found it to be quite effective in verifying online transactions and preventing fraudulent activities.Bank of America Checking is excellent!","2107":"I have had a generally good experience with BofA over the years. I have found that Bank of America branches vary in their willingness to serve the customer but have typically found that the bankers at Bank of America are typically helpful and go out of their way to help. The online banking feature is easy to use, and I love to use it on my cell phone. I can deposit checks through the app, which is incredibly convenient. The app also helps me locate ATMs wherever I'm at. Overall, I am a very satisfied Bank of America customer!","2108":"Their monthly fees are ridiculous. My family works for a small company that does not offer automatic deposit of our paychecks, so we paid $12 a month just for the privilege of using our own money every month for nearly a year. They refused to waive the fee. I closed my accounts when after being with them for over 10 years, they refused to take a handful of change as part of our weekly deposit. Last time I checked, all American legal tender is required to be accepted by law. Their loss. We found a local credit union to serve our needs without so much fuss.","421":"I have had the ABA Visa for almost a year, and am very happy. I joined for the signup bonus, which was the best in the business. I also like that the card is back by Bank of America, a very solid brand. It was available to me the second month, so very prompt and promise kept. There is no annual fee which makes this a premium card to have in my eyes, and the cash back bonus is the cherry on the top! 5 stars for the ABA card from a happy customer.","2109":"my debit card info was stolen from an online merchant recently. i called my bank and they cancelled the card immediately. a few days later i went in and they gave me a new card for my checking account and cancelled the debits made illegally with my card. very polite and expedient. this is the second time my card number has been compromised (due to online merchants lack of security measures) but NOT due to bank of america's site or operation. they are highly recommended.","420":"I have had the Spirit Airlines Credit Card for about 8 months now. We use this credit card as our main method of payment to earn miles. So far, we have booked a number of flights and have saved a lot of money. There are some negatives, however. Some flights cost an insane amount of miles and are not worth using your points. Also, there are blackout dates where you cannot book a flight. Overall, If you don't have very specific flight plans and are able to book in advance, you can really take advantage of this card.","422":"I've had this card for about 6 months now and have I have not had any problems with it so far. I love the fact that I can use it on my daily expenses with no problems. This is one of my favorite credit cards. The customer service is amazing and they are always easily accessible. Hopefully my credit score has risen tremendously so I can finance something in the future. I would definitely recommend this card to anyone especially if you spend frequently.","423":"I recently changed from Bank of America to a local credit union. It was a fantastic decision. The trade you make for more branches and ATM's is not worth bing treated terribly by customer service. On one occasion I deposited $100 into my checking account through the ATM. It was recorded as $10. I was understanding of the mistake but it took four business days to resolve. Crazy! My other major gripe is that if your waiting in line (which is almost always long) to see a teller and small business customer comes in, they are allowed to get right in. There is a special widow for these folks and they walk right in. Come on Bank of America!!","424":"The BankAmericard offers a $100 bonus after you spend $500 in the first 90 days! I have NEVER had any card that offered such such huge start-up bonus. I have always had the Blue from American Express card, and I never got this bonus. Also, the cash back is incredible, most of my sending is toward gas and groceries and I get extra on that. I especially like the fact that you can use it toward your statement balance. I appreciate that BankAmericard encourages responsible spending among their consumers. Paperless billing is a wonderful option since I am concerned about the environment, and I was surprised that Comerica did not provide this option.","2341":"I have had an account with BOA for over 10 years and have had little to no issue with their checking accounts. I started with a student checking account, which I then extended into a regular account. Last year I did happen to be a victim of identity theft, which I was able to go directly into my branch and speak with a customer service rep who helped me through the process. This was my first issue with the account, and I was surprised at how easy of a process the fraud claim was, contrary to what other people had told me. Although, I don't ever want to deal with that again, I really like how friendly and patient the customer service reps are. The only downfall is the monthly service fee of $12.00. I think this is a little high and would like to see this fee lowered, especially for customers of long time service.","427":"I opened up my bank of america savings account my first year of college. I have never had a problem with it so I have kept it ever since. I love that I can avoid the $5 monthly fee by simply setting up my automatic transfer of $25 from my checking to my savings. Another thing that helps me put some money into my savings is the Keep the Change which I usually forget about until I see it on my statement. The interest rate isn't too high but I didn't open this account with that in mind, I just needed a safe place to keep and save my money, and it has definitely served that purpose.","425":"Didn't really enjoy being a customer of Bank of America bank. I only had a account for a few months due to the horrible service I got once when disputing random charges on my card. When I was very new with the bank they seemed fine but a few months in the random charges started rolling in.","426":"Bank of America savings accounts are great! Signing up for the account was quick and easy. They helped me through the initial process since it was my first time opening up an account. The entire process only took minutes. I have the student account, so there is no monthly fee or anything for my savings account. There also isn't a minimum amount that must be in there. The keep the change program is a huge plus. It makes it easy to save. The change really adds up over time. The customer service is also really good. They always handle any problems I have with a smile and promptly.","2340":"I have no complaints about B of A at this time. Hatred of banks is popular, especially BIG ones, but I have found the bank and its employees to be fair, inexpensive, and always willing to help. My only little complaint would be the PMI on my mortgage. Perhaps the bank bust of 2008 requires it, but like getting out of jail early for good behavior, it would be nice if they dropped it after perhaps two years of on-time payments. Their online banking is fairly easy to navigate and extremely handy and it's nice being able to access not only my checking & savings account, but all my B of A related credit cards as well through the one log-on.","428":"I love that all I have to do to keep my savings account fee-free is to have a $25 transfer monthly. That's super easy for me. So easy in fact that the banker who set up my account scheduled it to happen automatically, so I don't have to worry about a thing. The Keep the Change feature is awesome as well! I know that because of that feature, I will be buying $xx.01 of gasoline just to get money to transfer to my savings. So effortless, BofA does all the work for me. The only thing I dislike is the limit on transfers between savings and checking. I usually transfer multiple times a month to cover my purchases, especially if I'm buying a plane ticket or something. That is literally my only gripe about them. Otherwise, nothing but good things with this savings account.","429":"Honestly, this is a fairly decent savings account. The interest is not very high, but it is extremely easy to transfer between my savings and checking account. I also like that Bank of America offers rounding up on my checking account, with the keep the change feature going directly to my savings account. My only problem with the account is that they require a minimum of $50 be in the account at all times or the bank will fine you. To me that is crazy, because if I want to spend all my money I have in my savings account, I should be able to do that.","2342":"I love this card I use it for everything. Plus the best part about it is I can see what purchases are happening as they are being charged. There customer service is great too I lost my card and had my number changed withing minutes and a new card with 3 days.","2343":"This bank is probably the worst you can choose. First of all, since it's one of the biggest banks you will always end up having to wait in line for about an hour when you go to a physical bank. Secondly, they have one of the worst fees in the world. they just rob you every month. Third, they really just treat you like a sheep. They pretty much treat you like sheep and they herd you into banking with them and taking the money off your back without you even noticing.Please do yourself a favor and choose another bank if you bank with Bank of America.","2344":"My overall experience has been good over the last eleven years, but the only problem I had was that the checking account kept wanting to link my credit card account for overdraft protection. When my checking account falls below zero, I wanted it to just decline the transaction. However, after unlinking the checking and credit card accounts, it would mysteriously link together again. It took a few tries to unlink the two accounts to remove the overdraft protection, but since my balance hasn't fallen below zero in a while (and I haven't been checking to see if they mysteriously linked again), I'm not sure.","2346":"Bank of America has been with me since I was a 10 year old child actor. They provide top notch service, especially within their branches that come equipped with money market managers who know everything about accounts and the market itself. I love the savings account I have with this bank, they make you aware of all the surcharges and brace you to prepare. They work with you not against you. BoA doesn't have many loopholes within their savings account, mostly just using the atm and not using up paper resources (which I am totally for). I think BoA will always be my Savings bank because I can trust them, the branches also make you a friend and ally...which is why I have never felt uncomfortable in a BoA branch.","2348":"I do like that there's no annual fee, and their customer service is friendly and efficient- not to mention easy to reach. I've had to use this card internationally when another card I had planned on using wouldn't work abroad before and I know from personal experience that it's great to travel with.","2347":"I only gave them one start because I had to. I wish there was an option for no stars. This bank is corrupt. There's no polite way to say it. Our mortgage was bought out from Country Wide, and had we known this would have happened, we never would have bought the home. During the economic crisis in 07-08, we got a few months behind on our mortgage. We stayed in contact, calling every week. We were told repeatedly that everything was ok, and that the bank had approved an agreement that would allow us to add the payment to the end of the loan. We kept calling, and tried to make payments. The bank REFUSED our payment, (claiming that they couldn't accept anything until the agreement was finalized, but again, telling us not to worry, after all, it was already approved.) About three months later, we received a denial on the agreement, and the banks reason was: (get ready to laugh), we made too much money. We were actually able to hold up our end of the agreement, but... we made too much money for them to give us one. I had seen these sorts of things on the news, and you never believe the people making these claims, but... its true. It happened to me. This bank should be closed down for fraudulent practices.","2345":"I have had a Student Advantage checking account for several years. It was very easy to apply and at the time they waived any monthly fees. There was a Bank of America ATM on my college campus so it made it very convenient to do banking in between classes. After graduation, I kept my checking account and it continues to serve me well.The few times that I had problems with charges that I did not authorize hitting my account, their customer service team investigated the charges quickly and it was resolved without any problems. As with most banks, the disclosures seem to be in a lot of legalese that I don't really understand...but that's to be expected with banks, isn't it?I like the online banking the best. I've been able to get some of my bills to come electronically to my Bank of America online account. BofA reminds me of upcoming bills and I can pay them electronically.","2349":"My experience was outstanding. Every time I go in they are always so helpful. I like to go in and get two dollar bills and although this is not a typical request, they go out of their way to help me and always ask if there is anything else I need. They are friendly, personable, and any time I have had questions they go above and beyond to answer them and ensure we are all on the same page.","670":"I like to save up the issues I have that necessitate in person visits and take care of them all at once. Well, the last time I went in, I brought up my four issues (all which were fairly straightforward) and the \"specialist\" had no clue how to fix or answer any of my questions. INSTEAD, he tried to get me to move my mortgage and retirement savings over to BofA! If you can't handle a simple checking account, why would I give you accounts that are much more complex and higher in dollar value?","671":"On many occasions, I have had an issue with Bank of America where unauthorized charges are posted to my account. I faced this issue a month back when unauthorized transactions were constantly being posted to my account. I had over 50 transactions being posted every day, transactions that I had not made or authorized. The amount of the transactions was quite small, but the fact that they were constantly being posted worried me. I called Bank of America and discussed this with them. Their customer service representative spent more than an hour confirming all the transactions with me and whether or not I had actually authorized them. At the end, the issue was sorted out and the entire amount was credited to my account. While this was not the first time that such charges were posted on the account, Bank of America has been supportive each time and has done everything to sort the issue as soon as possible.","672":"Bank of America is awesome. They have the best customer service agents when you call them on the phone. They always fix your problem as quickly as possible. I also love to walk into the location. They make you feel like a celebrity just for banking with them. They don't try to push their products on you unless one fits your situation. Great bank!","673":"In my 4 years of being with Bank of America, there have been multiple attempts at fraud on my credit or debit cards. Bank of America's Fraud department was quick to contact me and we were able to change my cards and information before any unlawful transactions occurred. I have also had great experiences with their local branches. The staff is always very professional and courteous. I've never had problems finding a Bank of America ATM near me.","676":"I've had a checking account with Bank Of America for over a decade. I recently checked my checking account statement and saw several weird charges. One of the charges originated in South Dakota and the other charge originated in Mexico! Since I've never been to either of those places and had not recently purchased anything in those amounts online, I called B of A immediately. I was told that both of the charges were showing that an actual debit card was swiped! Apparently, my debit card had been cloned and several people were attempting to verify that I had funds in my account. B of A cancelled my card immediately. The one thing that did bother me, however, was that the bank could not remove the charges until they were no longer \"pending\". That made me very nervous. The charges were reversed in the end.","675":"I opened up a savings account with Bank of America around the same time that I opened my checking account. At the time I didn\u2019t know much about investing nor savings accounts but I liked the idea of putting aside as much money as possible for savings. Well, that\u2019s what I did with the account, but with a checking account with Bank of America, you soon realize it is more of a liability than an asset with the amount of fees, charges and whatnot. I found myself constantly having to transfer from savings to checking which, of course, was subject to the transfer limit between accounts. And to top it all off, the pathetic interest rate I was getting with the savings account meant that there was simply no point to keeping any money in that account. I soon wizened up, closed the account and put my savings elsewhere, somewhere where I actually get a return on my savings.","674":"I have a Money Market savings account with Bank of America. I definitely don\u2019t think their services are as bad as their reputation makes them out to be, but that said I would still only give them a satisfactory rating. There are no hidden fees as long as you stay above the required balance. However there are a couple cons. One of those is the poor customer service. The regular employees who answer phones and deal with you at the desk are flunkies who can\u2019t really help you, so you have to wait to talk to their superiors. The rate also isn\u2019t the best.","677":"Compared to other cards (MasterCard, Visa), the BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card has a number of benefits: no annual fee, fairly low interest rate, 24-hour travel assistance, and a decent rewards program. I also really like the overdraft protection! The one major downside is that it requires you to have a pretty good credit score to qualify.","2871":"to reply from your famous bank of america COMPLAINTS OFFICE You Won't receive a complaint to your famous bank of america Complaints office you Won't receive anything direct to you instead take this OPINION!

This account is great for a working person who needs a no frills checking account. Your direct deposit will keep it so there are no fees, and one of the best parts about BoA is that they have ATMs literally everywhere. I never have to pay an ATM fee because I can always find a BoA ATM, even when I'm travelling. I've never had an issue with BoA in 12 years, a really satisfied customer. It's also really great if you have the BankAmericard Rewards credit card. The reward rate is pretty good for that, and it will just direct deposit the rewards right into your checking account. Mobile banking with mobile check deposits is amazing!","679":"I have learned to like (or at least tolerate) Bank of America Checking. I switched to this account when I got married about a year ago, as my husband had established his accounts there. Although I have never considered their customer service to be stellar, they have always been courteous and knowledgeable. I always find a convenient location, even when traveling. That has certainly been a perk of joining such a large bank!","2282":"I love my Bank of America cash rewards card. It is accepted everywhere and I never have any problems with it. When I make a large charge, I am glad the company is watching and calls me to confirm that it was indeed I that made the charge. It is also very convenient, there is a Bank of America close by everywhere I go! It's great.","2281":"I have had this account for around three years now, and it was my first savings account I ever set up. I really trust the Bank of America brand and even though the interest rate is not very high, I know my money is safe and ensured. I also receive very good customer service any time I need to access information about my account. I would definitely recommend to a friend.","2280":"I have had this card for about a year now and have had no problems. They alert me of suspicious activity. I can pay my bill online. It's great.","2287":"I love their Reward Platinum Plus Card. The cash rewards are simple and you can use the money to even pay your monthly bill! The best feature of this card is 'ShopSafe', which lets users generate a temporary card number for use with an online retailer. I find this feature very helpful in making purchases anywhere except the most trusted online brands.","2286":"I am not too over the moon about the Regular Savings account from Bank Of America. Being a recent college graduate money is a little tight so I decided to save up for a rainy day. So I started my savings account with BoA. $25 as a minimum deposit seemed fine to me and I had to maintain putting $25 in every month or I would be hit with a $5 monthly fee which wasn't too bad. Unfortunately, as someone starting their life after school, sometimes I didn't have the $25 to spare so I would miss a deposit and take the $5 hit. What I didn't know is that when you sign up they can set up the $25 to automatically be transferred from your other account. I hadn't been counting on that so when the transfer went through and took $25 from an account that only had $15 I was hit with a $35 Overdraft plus the $5 fee for not depositing a full $25 a month. BoA wasn't too sympathetic to my case. My advice is to read the fine print and if you want an account just to save a few extra bucks there are probably better alternatives.","2285":"I have had this checking account for about a year and have been pretty happy with it so far. I generally won't open a checking account that has a service fee, but Bank of America waives the fee if you have at least a certain amount direct deposited every month. I like that I can find branches and ATMs everywhere. We originally opened the account because my husband was travelling for business and we needed a bank that I could access in TN and he could also access in OH. I've been very happy with the quality of service I have received at the branch and via the CS line and I like the \"Keep the Change\" program they have for savings that you can connect to your checking.","2284":"I was excited to get a checking account at Bank of America but have not been too impressed with this banking institution. While the customer service seems to be decent and the people are helpful, they do not communicate overages and charges as well as they should. And the monthly fee for the account is ridiculous also, especially when you have your check directly deposited to our account. I think this is just an \"ok\" bank and am not overly impressed.","2283":"As a business owner for over the past 8 years I always strive to have a really good checking account with good features. Bank of America has always been good to me in this respect. The fees are low and I am rarely punished for having a low account balance. Sometimes if I do get charged a fee that was a direct result of something I\u2019ve done they are overly understanding and will most likely waive any fees. I like that feature. Good customer service.","1080":"The AAA Members Reward Credit Card looks promising, especially to those traveling outside of the country with its acceptance in 130 countries! Not many cards boast of that attribute. I like that there is overdraft protection and while there is a foreign transaction fee, there is no over-limit fee. This is awesome when I can't access the Internet to check my balances, but still need to make a purchase! And since there's no annual fee, this looks like a good card.","1081":"The Bank of America Cash Rewards card offers a very attractive cash back package.Unlike some cards that offer a 1% rate across the board, Bank of America will give you 2% cash back on groceries and 3% on your gas purchases. The card has no annual fee, a definite savings over other cards in this group.They have a 0% introductory rate for 12 months as well. Acceptance is widespread and the imbedded smart chip allows you to shop with confidence. Overall, this card is a good choice for those with excellent credit.","2289":"I've been banking with BofA for about a decade now. While their customer service has always been decent. I have always felt like BofA is out to gyp me out of dollars I deposit in my checking account. Over the years it's just been one type of fine or fee after another. While often when I notice a bunch of late fees\/overdraft fees\/minimum balance charges customer service waives some of them, I still feel constantly paranoid that my money is depleting without me even making a withdrawal.I feel as if there are methods BofA has to prevent these types of charges - alerts, overdraft protection etc. but none of them are enabled by default. Once I have finally updated my account to be as transparent as possible, I feel a little bit more at ease. But still, I won't ever be getting back the money I've lost banking with BofA.","2288":"I have had my Bank of America MyAccess Checking account since I was a student many years ago. I have never had a problem with the service and everything can be managed through the website or through the Bank of America phone app. The keep the change feature is great. It is a nice surprise to see some money that has accumulated in your savings account without any effort at all, when you go to check your balance.","2872":"I've been with Bank of America since 2007, and their service, products, and websites have gone down ever since.When I call their customer service associates, they are incompetent and do not understand my needs. Once my needs have been clarified, they don't really help. They love to cold transfer people to the wrong department so you get to explain your situation all over again. On an average call, this will happen anywhere from 2 to 5 times. Be ready to spend hours on the phone!As for their website, they have repeatedly made certain processes more and more complex. A simple transfer to my another person at Bank of America use to take 2 clicks and now takes 6 or 7 clicks. The website layout is not intuitive, and it can be very difficult to find what you need, because they move things around very often.As for their branches, I don't have the best experiences. The employees usually try to recruit me and take forever to help me with what I came in for.If you are looking  to open an account, look elsewhere.","1082":"The BankAmericard Cash Rewards credit card is great and if you know you're going to be making a large purchase soon, it gets even better. If you make a purchase of $500 within the first 90 days of opening an account you get a $100 bonus! Not bad.","1083":"I recently relocated to the area and opened a checking account with Bank of America. I originally applied for a checking account online and went to the bank with the intent of depositing a check only. While I was doing so, I was informed that I could get a temporary debit card until mine came in the mail. We also discovered that my address had transposed numbers. I was able to fix the address, get a temporary debit card, and made sure my account was secure by signing a signature card. The customer service I received was top notch! I listed Clear Disclosures as four stars; this has more to do with the nature of these legal documents being more complex than the average consumer needs. Great Job Bank of America!","1084":"I first got a Bank of America account because I wanted to cash my paychecks immediately and not wait for them to process. The company I worked for used Bank of America so this is what defined my choice. While I really appreciate the feature with which I can deposit checks from my phone there are some issues. The negative balance fee upsets me because I feel like the overdraft fee should take care of that problem. My biggest issue is that whenever I have a simple question I have a very hard time just getting through to a person on the phone. This often causes me to have to drive all the way to the bank to get a question answered. I honestly don't really use my bank of america account very much anymore due to some of the poor experiences I have had. that being said I still would recommend the account to friends because of it's many conveniences.","1086":"I have had this checking account for a little over a year now, and while I like the convenience of mobile check deposit and being able to transfer funds quickly and easy to my linked Merrill Edge brokerage account, what I wish this account had was some interest bearing options. For $12\/month, the least I could get is a nominal interest payment to make me feel like I'm actually not losing money on this checking account.","1085":"I have had my account at Bank of America since I was sixteen. Back then, I was granted a free checking account. Once you reach a certain age, as they do in all banks, your account is switched to a basic account. Though the account has a fee associated with it, mine is waived monthly because of my direct deposit. That, to me, is worth sticking around. After all, few banks offer free checking nowadays, and Bank of America at least offers you a way around the fee. My only concern is: I am a working mother and might soon take some time off of work and will, in turn, have no income coming into my account. With no direct deposit, I'd hate to have to pay the fee, but I'll cross that bridge when I get there, I guess. As for other account features, I never have to deal with a teller. I never have to wait on lines. Instead, I use their advanced ATM machine for everything, and I use their online banking to check my balance constantly (I don't keep a checkbook). All in all, my experience has been a good, convenient one. And one more thing: I LOVE their Keep the Change program! I've made myself quite a bit of money signing up for it!","1087":"I have had a checking account with Bank of America for 8 years. In that time they have been wonderful! Fees are fair and whenever I have had an issue they have been resolved to more than I could have expected. For example, I had an issue once where a check that had been written and then cancelled kept being run through my account fraudulently. This caused several items to overdraft and fees to be issued. I spoke with customer service and the check was cancelled through the fraud department and all fees cleared. I also like that if you do make a mistake in your accounting, they do not charge fees if money was in the account when you used your debit, even if there is no money when the final item posts. Also, as long as you deposit money into the account before close of business if over drafted, you will not be charged a fee. My only \"complaint\" is that I am currently in an area that Bank of America is not. The nearest branch is 60 miles away and although inconvenient, I will not change banks.","1088":"The most serious problem that I have faced while using the services offered by Bank of America is when my check card information was compromised in a country wide problem last year. This happened as part of a breach at a major retailer. The Bank was very quick to respond to this problem. They contacted my husband and me by mail quickly and sent us new debit cards. I hadn't really known about this problem and I am so glad I am banking with a company that keeps up with these things and keeps my money safe.","1089":"The BankAmericard Cash Rewards card is honestly the best that you will find out there. The rates just cannot be matched by anybody else right now. Throw in the awesome reward system and what more could you want? Honestly the card really shines in international usage and low loan rates. This is the only card that I have ever used for a loan and it really helped me out! Sending money overseas does not cost as high as others with this card.","300":"This card is great! I usually use it for my gas purchases throughout the week and any other little things that catch my eye. The low interest rate is helpful if you don't have that good credit and are looking to build. I also like the low cap penalty for being late and the option to get a loan if needed. It is nice to have that cushion in case something goes wrong.","301":"I have had this account for over 3 years now and for the most part it has been ok. When I first signed up you were thought of more as a valued customer no matter how much money you had in your account. Then they tried to raise their fees and make people pay for every little thing. After the backlash they changed some of those plans but still want to charge you to visit a branch. I have looked into switching to a local credit union as they have better rates but the lack of atm machines has made me less willing to do so. I would say if all you are looking for is an account to write checks or have a debit card then this is most likely going to work well for you. However if you need more access to a branch and the bank overall you may want to try somewhere else.","302":"I haven\u2019t had too many major problems with this checking account. There is another way to avoid fees, and that is to sign up for paperless statements. That\u2019s what I did, and it\u2019s been great, except for once. I am a college student, and I was laid off from my job. My mom had to talk to a teller about putting money into my account so that I could do my laundry at school, I had run out of clean clothes, and I had job interviews. I got charged the fee because she had to talk to a teller, and couldn\u2019t deposit money via an ATM. It was unfair, I live almost two hours from home, and they took money that I needed because my Mom tried to help me and didn\u2019t have the means to deposit money paperlessly. They could have waived the fee, they have done it before.","303":"Bank of America is an okay banking system. I have had some issues in the past, however. For instance I was once charged a series of $11 fees for money that was automatically being transferred from savings to checking - for a total of over $100. None of the fees were reversed no matter who I spoke with, even though the money was in my account and they could see it and I did not personally choose the transfers. Aside from that, the service is usually pretty good. I can do almost all of my banking from my phone which is extremely convenient since the nearest bank is a bit of a drive.","304":"I have not had the Bank of America MyAccess Checking account for very long, and I already do not like it. The fees are outrageous. not only do I get a twelve dollar monthly fee for my checking out but a fee for my savings account as well. as soon as possible I will switch to another bank. I shouldn't have to pay, to use the bank. I can have no money in my checking or savings, and they will STILL deduct the fees, then leaving my account in the negative. and THEN I get a fee for it being negative. all by their own doing. also, I can purchase something, and it's like they decide to finally process when It would put me in the negative. just an overall horrible experience with bank of America. if you have the option to use chase bank, do it.","305":"This was the first account I ever opened so I chose a bank that was well known and allowed me access to my money anytime I needed it. However after almost four years as a customer of this bank, I have really found that they seem to care more about making money than serving their customers. There have been many times where I have to either call or email them regarding money not being transferred to my account as I had requested. Or in one case way too much! Their comments have varied with some more understanding and willing to fix the issue to others who seem to want to keep on disagreeing with you. There have been many days when I have questioned why I have my money with them, the main one is due to access to nationwide atm machines. But now that you can get cash back at most stores, I would recommend that anyone looking to open a savings account with them first checks out the local options as they tend to offer better rates and less headaches.","307":"I have been with Bank of America for a couple of years now, and I must say they are absolutely wonderful! When I was looking into switching my banking account a few years back, it was almost impossible to find a good bank because of other bank's strict credit guidelines. I searched and searched. I had come across Bank of America online and thought I might as well try them, and I am glad that I did. They have been wonderful and more professional than other banks that I have been with. I am 100% satisfied with their services. They offer quick customer service resolution with no hassles. Wonderful!","306":"I have had my BoA checking account for about 2 years now. I was very happy at first, because i was a college student, and had a credit card attached to it. But after a while, i was incurring crazy fees associated with my checking account. They took money from my savings to cover overdraft fees, and it just dampened my whole experience. It would be ok if they just took the money from the savings, but they also charged 35 bucks to do it. Not cool. I have since stopped using the checking account as much because it just causes too much hassle.","308":"I was happy at first with my bank account until they started to take money out of my checking account to my savings account to cover the overdraft fee that had occurred. I am not thrilled about it especially since I could not afford to pay a bill because they took out some of the money to pay for the overdraft in my savings. I don't think I will stay with the bank once I move sometime in the Summer since this is now a new thing that they do.","309":"I have had my checking account with bank of america now for about 3 years. The thing I dislike about them is the fact there are various penalties and fees associated with the account. For that reason it is important to read over the rules and conditions when getting this account. They also have a \"keep the change\" feature which rounds your spending up to the nearest dollar when you purchase something and automatically puts the change in your savings account. This feature is cool because you are saving money and sometimes are not too alert to you. Overall though I dislike some of the fees associated with this account and am starting to hate corporate banks. I would suggest something like a credit union instead.","760":"I have been with Bank of America Since I was 16 and am now 23. Over the phone they are very difficult to get a hold of. I work 9 to 5 and find myself waiting for hours on the phone to speak to someone. I have a really good credit score for a young person and was calling to ask questions on getting a better credit card with a lower interest rate. I never got through to them over the phone so I gave up. I also have a checking account with them and that has been very smooth sailing. I love that they do not require a minimum because I am a full time employee but also a full time student and not having to worry about a balance is a great relief.","761":"I enjoy using this card, because there is never a problem with acceptance, on or offline. I have made recent purchases that were so quick and easy, I just couldn't believe it. And I always know that I can trust BankAmericard to protect my information.","762":"We have had bank of America for several years now. I have never had a problem with them. We opened a joint account before we were married and had an easy transition when changing our name. Going into the banks the agents were always very nice and helpful. They offered ways to help with rebuilding credit and any other question that we had. I have moved out of states and had no problems getting everything switched to the new state. I have the keep the change account and the savings account is great. I can transfer between accounts with ease by just clicking a button. Great company.","763":"I've got this card and i use it in the two quarters for gas that are not covered by my chase freedom card. The reason i use this card is for gas. There really are not many better cards in terms of cash back on gas and with the prices that gas has these days, 3% is 12 cents per gallon off. This card saves me 8 dollars a month. The only downside to this card is that after the 0% interest, it has a relatively high interest rate and that's the reason this card only gets 3 stars.","764":"As an AAA member, you can't go wrong with this card. The AAA Member Rewards credit card not only offers you a low introductory interest rate, but also a solid standard rate as well. The points you earn on qualifying purchases at gas stations, grocery stores and drug stores make this an even better deal. In addition to all of these outstanding benefits, you also have no annual fee. Excellent terms overall.","768":"I've had this account for about 5 or 6 years. I would not recommend using BOA unless you really have to. Since I live in a secluded area that only has BOA as a major bank company in the area, I am forced to use them. But throughout the years, they have not treated me well. They do not notify me about a change to my account and then wrongfully charge me. I have to call them up to change my account back and then they refund my costs. If they let me know in the first place and did not wrongfully change my account information, I would never have such headaches. Additionally their customer service is terrible.","766":"I have been a Bank of America customer since high school and couldn't be more pleased with the service I receive there. The Bank of America website makes it easy to review your account status and make transfers between accounts. Additionally, you can make deposits through ATMs and their mobile app. They offer branches nationwide, and it's always easy to find a location when I'm traveling. I've also had to use their online customer support. The agents were pleasant and quick to resolve the issue I was facing.","769":"So I've had a savings account with Bank of America for about 5 years now, and there isn't much great to say about it. It's pretty average. The fees are pretty low and avoidable if you have at least $300 in the account. The one great thing about Bank of America is that they are just about everywhere if you live in a big city like Chicago where I live.","767":"I've been a Bank of America customer for many years, despite moving to a state without a Bank of America location. Their mobile app makes it easy to deposit checks and online customer support is out of this world. Their staff is competent, friendly and eager to help. Additionally, their checking account allows a \"keep the change\" feature that rounds your transaction up to the dollar and transfers the difference into savings. It's been a great and painless way to save for the future. I'd recommend this account to anyone, and give them five stars if they opened a Mississippi location.","765":"I like that you can earn 1 point per $1 on purchases everywhere, that's great. I also like that you can earn 2 points per $1 for gas, grocery and drug store purchases and 3 points per $1 on all qualifying AAA and travel purchases. It's like the rewards card of Bank of America . It's great that there is no overdraft limit. The grace period is very generous. The only downfall I see is that regular is very high.","580":"Bank Of America is all you need to say! Great cost service and a great card for long term and even short term finance.","581":"The AAA Member Rewards Card seems to be a really good offer. The card offers very attractive interest rates. This one thing makes the card a really good deal. In addition to the great interest rates offered, there is no annual fee. This card offers more with overdraft protection. The AAA Member Rewards Card offers really nice rewards on all purchases. You can use these rewards for cash back, travel and hotel discounts, etc. It is easy to see that this card offer is a good deal for most people who seek a reward for purchases and a reasonable interest rate. The offer is attractive to most anyone.","583":"I was with Bank of America as I got my first job. I was in high school and not that knowledgeable about how the banking system worked. My account got too low because I hadn't transferred money from savings to checking and I somehow got charged 14 Overdraft fees because the bank wouldn't let me back date the transfer. This costed me over $400. I will not be doing business with Bank of America again anytime in the future.","582":"I have had Bank of America checking for years, ever since I was a high school student. I do not pay a monthly fee, and there are plenty of ATMs in the Bronx and Manhattan to avoid having to pay fees for using another ATM. Whenever I have called customer service, which is rarely, I have gotten a reasonable answer. Their online bill pay service is awesome. Many vendors, such as Paypal and my credit card company, are able to receive payments electronically. I don\u2019t have to use my checkbook as much. I would definitely recommend this account, as long as you are not paying a monthly fee.","585":"This is a great account as long as you are not paying for it . I have a mortgage with Bank of America, which gives me the ability to have an Advantage Checking account without paying any fees. With this account you receive free money orders, cashier checks, and regular checks; an additional interest checking account; and two money market savings accounts. $25 is fairly steep for a simple account that doesn't give you too much interest, so I wouldn't pay for this account, but I do recommend it if you have a mortgage or can hold over $10,000 in there at all times.","584":"I have been with bank of america for about 6 years. We are pretty happy with them, not to say we haven't had some hiccups along the way (i.e. not allowed to pull more than $300 out of an ATM at a time, claiming our signatures did not match constantly when we tried to withdraw money). Other than those gripes the checking and savings is good. I personally love the keep the change and also that we don't get charged a monthly fee because we have direct deposit. Bank of America has always taken care of any issue with charges we had or if our bank card has been stolen.","589":"I'll be honest, I recently closed this account, and I couldn't be any happier to get rid of it. The fees are ridiculous, the interest rate is terrible, and it doesn't help that Bank of America is already a terrible company that doesn't really care for it's customers. Get an account with a Credit union instead, it will save you big time.","588":"While Bank of America certainly has its competitors for convenience, I can't exactly say that I had a great time with having a Savings Account with them. Every customer service experience I have ever had with them has been nothing but a big pain. They are simply too big to care about the little guy, and let's be honest, the interest rates on this account are simply not up to snuff, and the maintenance fees can really get out of hand, especially for a college student. Over all, I certainly wouldn't recommend it.","586":"I'll give it to you, Bank of America does not have a great reputation, and certainly I'm not going to be the one to change your mind about this. HOWEVER, I will say I haven't had any issues. I use it as an overflow for my checking account and that's fine enough for me. It doesn't have any additional fees as long as you have a minimal balance and you can get to a branch pretty much anywhere.Would I pick this over a credit union? no. Would I pick this over stuffing hundreds of bills into my mattress, certainly.","1250":"I\u2019m quite content with Bank of America. My biggest complaint would be the twelve dollar monthly fee. The fee is cheaper than other banks, but it should not cost me $140 dollars a year to maintain a checking account. One of the best perks about Bank of America is the way I can deposit checks. I can just take a check to any Bank of America ATM and directly deposit the check into my account. I don\u2019t need to wait in line for the teller. That is a really nice advantage. I usually only deal with tellers, if I need to deposit money into my account, and I need the money to post the same day. I love having the option of interacting with the banking staff, or doing the banking on my own terms. My account has been overdrawn a couple of times, and I\u2019ve been able to get the fees waived, because of miscalculations on my part. I can honestly say that the staff of Bank of America, really goes the extra mile for their customers. I\u2019ve only been with BOA for about a year and a half, but it\u2019s been my favorite bank to have a checking account with, over all the other big banks that I\u2019ve tried. The debit card comes with extra security, as it offers the patron the choice of having their picture on their card. I personally think that gives my debit card an extra touch of flair. I also love the fact that I literally have a banking center right across from my campus. I would recommend Bank of America to my friends, and other people for their strong commitment to customer service, and the abundance of options that allow the customer to bank at their own terms.","587":"I DO NOT SUGGEST THIS ACCOUNT TO ANYONE. There is little interest that is collected, and with the lack of customer services, why would I want them to hold all my money so I keep a high balance and don't receive a monthly maintenance fee? For being a \"platinum\" customer, this account is horrid. I received 5 dollars last year... 5 DOLLARS. I' am now moving my funds to a credit union where I will be able to get more interest and hopefully receive a better customer experience.","1251":"This account has its ups and downs, the most annoying aspect being the fee of $12 if you have a balance lower than $1500. For some that's no big deal, but at some points in situation I couldn't afford to transfer money over or keep a balance that high. That being said, the service is very good as far as security and ease of use.","1252":"I have had this account since 1993. Honestly, I love it. The maintenance fees are waived because I use direct deposit. The most important feature, to me, is online banking. Bank of America\u2019s Online Banking is consistently rated the best, and most secure, in the industry. The fact that I can pay anyone, without writing a check, is fantastic. Moreover, I can bank on the go with the mobile app. I don\u2019t remember the last time I set foot in an actual bank branch.","1255":"This Bank of America Cash Rewards card at first glance seems like a great deal. The only problem is that after the initial flood of rewards in the first few months of spending, the rewards decrease rapidly. Also, one has to be careful as the intro rate is for a limited time. If you are the kind of person who pays the bill off every month this might be a good card for you. Just be leery of increasing interest rates.","1253":"I've had this account for over a decade. I had forgotten about the need to keep at least $1500 in the account until just recently, when I finished school and no longer had student loans going into my account. I haven't been able to maintain a balance and the fees hit me every month. It's getting a little frustrating and I don't think I will be with this account for much longer.","1254":"I love this card! My first year, i received 0% interest, which allowed me so much freedom. In addition, i get cash rewards on my spending. I can either use them to buy things, or have them credited towards my monthly payment. And i got the opportunity to personalize the card to my liking!","1256":"The AAA Member Rewards Card is nice because it lets you earn points as you spend. You can earn up to 3 points per $1 on select items. I didn\u2019t like that the interest rate could get as high as 23%. That seems way higher than my competition cards. My Citibank card has only 12% interest. Overall, I feel like I could earn a lot by using this card, like possible travel vouchers. That is reason enough to try this card out!","990":"I have had a Bank of America checking account since 1986. Boy has this bank come a long way into the internet age! There are so many things that I can do online like pay my bills and send money to other (different) bank accounts. I like that I can transfer funds to other investment institutions. Recently I signed up for mobile banking using my Iphone. The service has saved me numerous trips to the bank to deposit checks. The only problem with a big bank like this is customer service. If I have an issue with a bank it really stresses me out. I HATE having to go through all the telephone prompts just to be able to speak with someone. I usually try to resolve issues online, so when I need to actually talk with someone it sucks to have to push all those buttons on my phone.","993":"Bank of America Online checking is what I use. It's Bank of america's only no-monthly-fee option - but the downside is that you can't talk to a teller in the brick and mortar store. I have to do all my banking through the app or the ATM. That works for me, but probably wouldn't be ideal for everyone. When I do have questions or see an unexpected charge, the phone customer service has been lovely, and will often refund various fees that were not completely disclosed. Specifically, I was offered the opportunity online to link this checking account with my savings - so I wouldn't pay the overdraft fee of $35 + percentage. What was not clear, is that there's a $10 fee for the service. It's better than the original fee, but still it should have been much clearer.","994":"My Bank of America savings account was linked to my checking account, and I had both accounts for some time when they began charging me a fee to have these accounts. Even though I don't use them very often since I have another primary account with a different bank, they insisted these were maintenance fees to upkeep the account. When I spoke to customer service, they seemed uninterested in my issue, and when I told them I'd like to just close the account, including my open credit card, they became rude. Needless to say, I'm glad I moved on.","995":"One would think that in these times large banks would promote people saving. Bank of America regular savings has such a piddling little interest rate that it is hardly worth keeping money in an account at their bank. We know that they charge 13% to even good credit card holders. They should crank up the rate enough so that people will actually put aside money. It is getting very difficult to find an account for small savers. This is sure not the place to look. Yes, it is easy to transfer money in and out to other accounts if you have one but this bank offers no incentive to new customers who may not have much to save.","991":"My Bank of America Savings account is awesome. My interest rate is not as high as I want, but for a large bank, it's not too shabby. I really enjoy the fact that I'm able to link it into every other Bank of America service I have (I also have a checking account and a Cash Back credit Card). It's so easy to transfer money in between the three using their online service. The ease of use and accessibility is totally worth the mediocre interest rate. It's nice to have a small pot of money accessible in this account and keep the bigger chunk of money in my credit union.","1257":"I've been with Bank of America for a long time, although I've had other accounts with other banks. I've always kept this account due to the service that I get; Bank of America has several locations across the country and very useful online access. I ended up with a few perks from the job I had at the time like free money orders, which has been great for paying rent. I find comfort in banking with a large corporation because I feel like they will be around for a while. My favorite thing about this account is my WWF Debit card with a panda picture on it; I've gotten so many compliments on that card!","1258":"I am rather pleased with this account I just opened it a few months ago after being a credit union only girl. But after accepting a job that requires me to travel, I needed a bank that is all over the place. There are atm fees for non bank atms so watch out. They tack them on even after the atm's other fees so if the atm charges Two dollars boa charges 2.50. Other than that the only problem I have with them is their lack of keeping up digitally. If you have funds deposited and funds pending they add it to the beginning balance, making it look like you have hundreds more than you really do. So WATCH OUT. Other than that they are pretty great as far as technical advances compared to a credit union. They also are pretty fairly priced that fee is waived as long as there is a min. Deposit every month. Overall they are a good national bank.","1259":"I have been with Bank of America since I was in high school, and I was keeping my lawn mowing money in a student account with them. I have been so impressed with this account. I have lost multiple cards and have had no problem replacing them. I have moved several times, and there hasn't been a single glitch along the way. It is just a checking account so if you're looking for any sort of interest rate you're out of luck. They have ATMs literally everywhere and you can even deposit checks on your phone which is bizarre and extremely convenient. I wouldn't look anywhere else for a checking account.","992":"I am very very picky when it comes to choosing a bank. Why?... Because we all prefer to choose a bank and stick with it... The hassles of switching banks are such a pain... Anyways, i love my checking account with Bank Of America because they treat you like a real person and simplify everything for you. They are also pretty lenient with fees... For example, i had signed up for a certain account and i was required to have a certain amount in there every month or they would charge me a fee... I didn't know this (or i forgot) and i got fined... I simply walked in, and told them about my situation. They were very understanding and returned my money. Also they have ATM's and banks all over America. It's nice to have access to your bank when you need it.","998":"I like the fact that there is no annual fee and an intro rate on transfers. I think that if someone wisely used the card, it could help them regain standing with their financial situation. The only downside I see is that the interest rates have the potential to get very high very quickly.","996":"I've had a checking account with BofA for a while now. While everything is very formal and big business cold I can't say I've had any complaints. I've had a couple identity theft problems and both times things were handled extremely quickly and very much to my satisfaction. Overall I've found them a pleasure to have as my main account, their online banking options are definitely the best I've experienced.","997":"I have had this card for about three months - I love it! I earn 1% cash back on all of my purchases, 2% cash back on groceries, and 3% cash back on fuel purchases! On top of that, after I spent $500 during the first 3 months, I was given a $100 bonus! Plus it is at 0% interest for the first year and there is no annual fee. Of the credit cards I have had this is overall my favorite, with the best rewards! I highly recommend it!","999":"I've been with Bank of America since high school (over 10 years). I'm a fan of their checking because there are BofA ATM machines everywhere and they cause me little headaches. However I'm not too big of a fan of my savings account. Very little interest rate with an annoying maintenance fee. I do deposit a little bit of money monthly into the savings but I usually invest my money elsewhere. One positive is that transferring money from savings is simple and easy. I'd recommend the checking account but savings.","1172":"I really like the ease of use of this checking account. I'm able to easily check my finances at home and while on the go on my phone, something I can't do currently with my CU. I use this account mainly for making miscellaneous payments and unexpected purchases, and it's been pretty good so far. Customer service is nice and courteous as always.","1171":"I have never had a problem with my Bank of America MyAccess account. I really enjoy being able to log in and view my transactions online. I also like the fact that customer service is really helpful any time I have a problem. They have really cleaned up their act in the past few years. I would highly recommend them.","1170":"I've had a Bank of American Regular Savings account for over five years. The monthly fee is waived since i have it linked to my regular checking account, through the keep the change program. It is in fact the easiest account to manage since I can transfer money from my other BOA accounts with the click of a button and also pay my credit cards. I also have quick access to my funds when using my debit card everywhere. Just try to have enough money on your checking and savings account so that you don't have to deal with overdraft fees and stuff, which is a pain in the a.. with any bank.","1174":"I have had a very good experience with Bank of America Advantage Checking. I have direct deposit, so I do not have to pay a monthly maintenance fee. I also have linked a savings account, so if I ever do slip up, the funds are automatically transferred to the checking account to avoid any overdraft fees. The checks themselves are free. I can order them online through the online banking portal, and I only pay a small shipping fee. I have had the account for several years, and I have been very pleased with the customer service at both my local branch and over the phone. This is a great account if you have direct deposit, or keep a minimum balance in a savings also with Bank of America, as they calculate the minimum balance with all of your accounts with them, not just the checking. The best feature of the account is having access to all services without a maintenance fee.","1173":"Savings account holder for three-plus years. An average savings account, possessing a low interest rate and accompanied by many of the typical fees, including a $5 monthly maintenance fee (if you do not transfer at least $25 in, which is easy for most to do) and often usurious overdraft fees (no sliding scale based on the amount of overdraft and they seem to process payments in a way that maximize chances to overdraft in my opinion). Mixed experiences with customer service, though things do usually get resolved to my satisfaction (if slower than one would like). Not the worst company I have dealt with, but far from ideal, though the easy physical access to machines is a great benefit since they charge fees to use any other bank's machines.","1175":"I am customer of Bank of America. I have a checking account to make online transactions and to receive funds from american companies. I really appreciated the customer service of this bank when i tried to open such an account. I can use this checking account worldwide without any barrier. When i started data entry jobs online I had a problem with receiving funds from american companies but after opening this checking account my problem was solved. I am so happy now because of this account and this is the only solution for my online business.","1176":"I like this checking account. It offers me all the organizational tools that I need, but I do have some things I think they could improve. Their fees are quite high. I feel this is where they make a lot of money from consumers. I wish they could reduce the fees at least by 10%. Other than that, I feel like it's the average run of the mill account. I will keep it until I find something better.","1177":"Compared to other cards, this card isn't overly impressive. It's okay, but you have to have an excellent credit score to obtain it, not to mention the late fee is a bit excessive. It looks like it would be a great card for foreign travel, but if you're not doing a lot of that, what is the point in having it? I do like that it has the shopsafe feature, however. It never hurts in this day and age to have an extra layer of safety.","1178":"Well, one thing I don't like about the card is the max late fee, I don't really like it that much and I don't really see anything interesting at all about the card also. I am comparing it to Chase Freedom - $100 Bonus Cash Back and by looking at it it's way better to have than this card in my opinion.","1179":"I've had the Alaska Airlines credit card for several years. Although the yearly fee is high, there are benefits to the card that outweigh that. I like the yearly companion ticket as well as the miles that build up for any purchase made using the card. I recently discovered the Alaska Airlines mileage shopping website, where if you purchase items through select vendors, you receive bonus miles. I'm happy to report there are several stores I frequently use on-line, including QVC! I'm looking forward to accruing more miles; great benefit!","1570":"I cannot say enough that is negative about using this bank. If you watched the news in the past you would know how they messed up people's checking accounts and are being sued for it. We had two checking accounts at one time , we then thought we closed one of them to later find out it did not get closed and this bank just kept charging us. This all added up in the end to cost us 1800 dollars of money that just went to overdraft fees. Do not use this bank , I am not going to anymore. They border on almost crooks.","1571":"The AAA Member Rewards Credit Card does have some perks and some downfalls as well. The perks to it is that you can earn 2 point per $1 for gas, grocery, and drug store purchases and 3 points per $ on all qualifying AAA and travel purchases.  Another perk is that you can earn 1 point per $1 on purchases everywhere.  Also there is no annual fee which makes it great too. The downfalls to the card are that after the 12 months your rate would be 12.99% - 22.99% that is extremely high.","1572":"Overall this card seems like it has some outstanding perks. The Chase card I currently use does not have the additional benefits of this card and its offers. I think there is a lot of potential for cash rewards and additional rewards. Earning 1% cash back on every purchase, 2% on groceries and 3% on gas is fabulous since that's usually where I use my credit card the most.  The earning potential seems much higher than my current card. In addition, I enjoy the extra bonuses and the low interest. Moreover, the fact that there is no annual fee is probably one of the best perks.","1573":"I don't use this checking account because of the interest, and people should not sign up for this because it offers a 0.01% rate (which is pitiful). The benefit of this account is the service you get. You get free checks for life, and the fee itself can be waived if you link the account to a CD, brokerage, or even mortgage account. Also, as an advantage holder you can normally get comp banking services like cashier's checks and signature guarantees, which normally would cost $15-$20. Of course, you can't get these for free all the time but once every 6 months the teller will give them to you for free.I recommend if you can maintain the balances to waive the monthly fee. If you cannot, this account is not for you.","1574":"When i first signed up for this account, they asked if i was going to be using direct deposit and did not tell me about the fee if you fail to use direct deposit unless you maintain a $1500 balance.  The main reason i was going to use this bank was that they were the first in my area to accept deposits at the atm...1 month after i decided to move my direct deposit to a different account, i found out that they were billing me $12 per month to hold my money and seeing that the interest you gain on your money here is literally 0 percent, there is really no point of maintaining an account here as you can make deposits with your phone now with nearly every bank.","1576":"I enjoy having a checking account with Bank of America. There are branches located all over the country and plenty of ATM's as well. The $12 fee could understandably make some people a little hesitant at first. However, by simply utilizing direct deposit and having at least $250 deposited each statement or having a minimum balance of at least $1500, you are able to get out of the fee. Worst case scenario, $12 is not as bad as a lot of banks so I find it to be an acceptable amount. They also have friendly employees and great customer service! I highly recommend them!","1190":"I have this card for many years now and found that this is one of the best credit cards overall. They offer a competitive cash back rate (2% on groceries, 3% on gas, 1% on everything else) and also there is no annual fee.And since this is Bank of America, ATMs are easy to find for cash advances and the customer service is top notch offering zero liability protection on unauthorized charges. I highly recommend applying for this card!","1575":"I have a Bank of America MyAccess checking account. In the seven years since I signed up, I have never paid a bank fee except to replenish my checks. You just need to have direct deposit, which most people do. It is by far the most convenient checking account out there. My favorite part is how I can transfer funds easily to friends who also have Bank of America, this comes in handy when you're out somewhere and need to split the cost of something but don't have cash. The account gets four stars instead of five because once they canceled my debit card for the account due to suspected fraud and didn't tell me, so I ended up at Starbucks without a way to pay. Overall, a good choice.","1577":"I have banked with bank of america for a long time. For years I've had a checking account and my parents have a mortgage through them. For this time they have usually been very understanding and have helped me with all my issues until recently. This fall, I started to notice a small fee being charged to my checking account. I was told the fee had been waived for years until recently without my knowledge. This fee is no longer able to be waived and the fee charges were not refunded. Be cautious when signing up for anything and know just because you were not charged in the past doesn't mean they won't surprise you with an old rule you've forgot.","1192":"I have used this card for over 10 years and have never had any issues with it, nor the company. As mentioned before, there are BoA ATM's everywhere, so no charges for last minute withdrawals, usually. The cash bonus is always nice, as well!! I almost lost my card once, so I contacted BoA's support team, and they responded quickly, and were generous enough to replace my card ASAP, along with freezing my bank account, but it didn't have to come to that. I will one day switch to a BoA rewards program card, once I look at all of the benefits.","1191":"I love this card its Rewards are easy to redeem, I redeemed 500.00 last year and already at 20,000 points. I like to get the check back and then deposit it into my MM. I always get the check in 7-10 days. So far i have no problems. I usually wait until I have the 50,000 points and redeem the 500.00. Since it was the end of the year I put in for the 25,000. and i forgot to talk about my late fees. i was a little late with paying my bill but they waived it for me, so they also have great customer service. this card is great. I can't say anything but great things about this card.","1579":"This card is great for students. It would be nicer if it had a rewards program. Interest rates tend to be higher than most, but with Bank of America customer service it is pretty good.","1578":"I have the Bank of America Cash Rewards card and really enjoy the 3% bonus on gas. While other cards are more attractive for travel and shopping, this card is great for those of us that spend a lot of time on the road. Because I already bank with them, Bank of America adds an additional 10% to my rewards if I redeem to a checking account from them. I feel that this card is one of the best out there for gas. Also, the 1% back on everything is standard so there is not much to complain about with this card.","1193":"I've had a mixed experience with Bank of America. Calling customer service can be a nightmare, I lost my card one day and it took me a long time to get in touch with the right person to even report the card lost to. It's a separate number, they would transfer me, it would disconnect, the wait time to talk to someone was a long time. This is a big deal when someone is actively spending money on your account. I could refresh my page and see them spend more money every few minutes. Eventually it got worked out, and the fraud department took care of it reimbursing me.On the flip side, service at my local branch has always been good. There are plenty of staff members and everyone has always been helpful. It makes a difference I suppose when you are looking at the person you're talking with. It shouldn't...but it does.","1197":"I love the convenience of having an account at a well established bank such as Bank of America, however, my convenience comes at a cost. There are pros and cons in having a relationship with this financial institution but I still somehow maintain my relationship with them because of the convenience factor. The customer service representatives at the bank as well as over the phone are always very pleasant and eager to assist. The main downside to banking with Bank of America is the exorbitant fees. I can do without the $12 per month maintenance fee. I'm still trying to understand what it's for and why it's so much when other banks have either done away with the fee or charge way less. Surely, it's a way to extort more money out of loyal customers who in fact hold the financial institution together. Is this what it comes down to? Loyalty with no perks or benefits. So sad.","1196":"I have been with BoA for over six years. They have provided great customer service throughout most of this time and have allowed me to keep my money secure for rare and occasionally ordinary expenses before I spend it. The fees may be a point of trouble for some, but as long as your are mindful of the terms and conditions of the account, you shouldn't have any problems. All in all, I have no regrets!","1195":"I originally signed up with Bank of America in order to take advantage of their agreement with Barclays bank in the UK, as I split my time between both countries. The people I have interacted with have always been friendly and willing to help. I was the victim of fraud in September 2013, and though the fraud department continued to deny my claims, I eventually spoke with a Bank of America representative in person and they managed to push my claim through. The online system works well too.","1194":"I enjoy Bank of America for the main reason that they have a large network of ATMs here in the States. Having free checking is a rarity these days, so I suppose the $12 fee is now reasonable. (I have had the Bank of America MyAccess Checking account for a few years now.) I also enjoy their website. The downside is that even if you are more than $2 overdraft, you will be hit by a huge overdraft fee. So my advice is that if you get this account, don\u2019t be in overdraft.","1199":"I actually really like Bank of America, but I don't love this checking account. The best part is that they make things really simple: ordering checks can be done through their site, transfers and bill pay are dummy-proof, etc. And their customer service is incredible. They're also great about sending you replacement cards free of charge. But the negatives outweigh the positives for me: they charge crazy fees for overdraft if you're not protected by linking your checking to your BofA credit card (but even then, the credit card charges you a $10 \"overdraft protection fee\"). They also charge foreign transaction fees which is really weird for a bank that's linked to international banks. You're treated more like a number than a customer. It's a great account if you never overdraft, and don't want any perks with a checking account. Simple, super easy to use, and amazing customer service. But too many fees, bottom line.","1198":"I have had a savings account with Bank of America for over 3 years. It provides easy access to my money without worrying about checks, etc. The low interest rate is not great, but better than nothing. It is very convenient when traveling, as I have always been able to find a Bank of America atm. I also like that my family or friends can deposit money in my account should an emergency arise.","210":"The BankAmericard Credit Card is a great tool to help build your credit. It offers a generous grace period of 25 days, and its maximum late fee is only 35 dollars. My other credit card has a maximum late fee of 70 dollars, so this is a much better alternative to that. I enjoy the overdraft protection feature, as my previous card was without that, and I was always in debt with overdraft balances. The only displeasure I have about this credit card is that the bonus is not available until after you make $500 in purchases which is quite a lot for my expenditures and budget to meet.","211":"The BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is an interesting card. It's not horrible, but it does require that you have a good credit history, and if you have one of those, you'll probably go for a card with a prettier rate than this one. The benefits of this card are nice, but there are much better. I'm not sure why anyone would choose this card over others, considering the credit history rate to benefits ratio is pretty terrible. On the flip side, if you travel a lot (and I mean A LOT), this card would be amazing for you. The perks for travel are wonderful, as well as the rewards.","212":"Since I moved away for college, I signed up for an account with Bank of America. My friend recommended the bank to me, and I can not be happier that I listened to him. The customer service is top notch at Bank of America, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting the moment you walk in. Troubleshooting over telephone is nice and efficient, and always resolves any issues I have. My money always feels safe in their account, and I couldn't feel better about continuing my banking with Bank of America for the foreseeable future!","213":"Bank of America has been a consistent banking option that I have used for years now. I have had very few problems with them and the only time that I had an issue with a charge it was fixed promptly. The service is always top notch in my local branch and I can see myself using them for as long as they are around!","215":"We live in Milwaukee and have been using this savings account for about 4 years now. It is an average savings account with no real perks for saving with them. You must keep a balance of $300 to keep from getting a monthly fee of $25. So we use this account strictly for saving our extra money that we earn. The staff is great and we are greeted instantly upon entrance to the bank and all the staff members know us by name and are so kind. I would recommend this bank to anyone who has a balance over $500 because you won't be charged a fee and you will get great service. You will also be in and out of the bank in 5 minutes max. Great customer service!!","214":"My BoA savings account is good in that it provides a very liquid place to transfer money in addition to my checking account. It is free to open, and carries no annual fees (so long as you meet very basic criteria). The 0.01% interest rate isn't very appealing, and there are many options that better this investment performance (i.e. Ally Bank). However, should you need access to these funds it can take up to 3 business days. We routinely keep a small \"back-up\" fund in this account, with other nest-egg funds in a better performing account. I would recommend it to those with other existing accounts at BoA.","216":"Overall, the BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is an Okay credit card; however, because it requires an excellent credit rating, it will be unobtainable for most people. The initial bonus is average considering how much they expect you to spend. If you want more bang for your buck though, there are other cards out there that will give you point bonuses if you shop at certain places.","218":"Bank of America is a great bank to work with. The customer service there is top notch compared to other banks I have been with. I took out a CD there and the rates were higher than any other bank in my area. Taking out the CD was really fast and the employee who helped me processed it very quickly. When my CD matured they sent me a notification letter in the mail so I knew when it was done. I would recommend them to all my family and friends who are looking for an outstanding bank. They are very honest and friendly. I have never had a problem with them.","217":"Bank of America is the best bank in my opinion. I have banked with other banks over the years and none comes close. Every time I have ever had a problem they worked with me right away and fixed it. A few years back some company I had never even heard of was taking money out of my account every month and I didn't realize it so I kept paying the overdrafts and everything. Once I caught on Bank of America instantly closed my account and opened me a new one with ALL of my funds reimbursed even the overdraft fees. The customer service is always extraordinary!","219":"Bank of America has been an excellent choice for checking account purposes since I'm a student and students aren't required to have a minimum amount of money in their accounts. I still get the benefits everyone else gets like overdraft protection (which I used when I accidentally bought something off a website twice), and the \"Keep the change\" savings transfers that help me save money. They have pretty cool features too on their android app like depositing a check just by taking a picture of it, which is handy because I don't have a car so a trip to their location is pretty tough. The only con I've found in Bank of America so far is that when I deposit large amounts of money, not all of it is available right away from the atm. This hasn't been a problem yet but I imagine that it could be one day.","3499":"Average At Best I was forced to open a checking account by a previous employer. He would not deposit my check directly if I banked elsewhere because he would have to pay a fee. That should have told me there all I needed to know about Bank of America, but I acquiesced for his sake. When I quit him, I decided it was easier to keep the account and bank locally. In that time, I watched my account be charged for balance transfers at an exorbitant rate, charged a service fee when I didn't have two direct deposits made in the month that I was transitioning between jobs and other small fees here and there. Additionally, there was never a sense of friendliness or care on behalf of the employees. The convenience factor of the ATMs was the only reason I continued to keep the account, and in time, I decided to just close it all together. Apparently, others did the same because now B of A is no longer even located in that building and I believe no longer in that city except for an ATM. I will never use them again, and I am sure they could care less, but do yourself a favor and use a local bank where they at least feign care because they truly need your business.","1150":"I've had the Bank of America Cash Rewards card for a few years now, and use it nearly exclusively. It has a low interest rate, no annual fee, and gives me cash back on purchases. I put most things on the card and try to pay it off each month in order to reap the maximum benefits. I also opened a Bank of America on-line checking account, so I get a 10% bonus on the rewards when I deposit them in this account. They have also made it easier to redeem rewards. I used to have to call and transfer the funds, but now I can do it all online.","1151":"This card is no longer offered at BoA but when it was I didn't hesitate to sign up for it. What I like the most about this card is the convenience of having it linked to my other accounts at BoA. Paying my bill is a breeze and it doesn't have a yearly fee. Visa signature cards have nice perks and up to a few months ago they were offering buy one get one free movie tickets at fandango. Overall, it is a decent card if you are a bank of america customer. Also, they changed the design of the card and it is no longer black.","1152":"this credit card has been great for me while I've been away at school. I've never had any issues and the limits are set to a reasonable amount as to have enough to spend but not over spend you money!","1153":"This is much better than the other cards I have used before. Very easy to abide limits, and no unfair restrictions in my opinion. There are a ton of BofA ATM's nearby, so fees are nothing to worry about. This is the card I use at college, and I have never had any problems with it. The one time support contacted me (about a possible fraud activity, but nothing was wrong, it was just a routine checkup), the staff was very professional and incredibly helpful. I would definitely recommend to a friend.","3500":"Totally Incompetent First, I have no problem with my local bank, other than that they are severely understaffed. My gripe is with the mortgage department in some invisible place where you can never speak to the same person twice. This started in July when I received a letter asking for verification of homeowner's insurance. If I had none, they would begin charging me about $2400 for coverage (about triple what I actually do pay) I promptly mailed all the information to the designated location. A month later, I received the same letter. After calling them, they said they never got the information. I then FAXED it to them. A month later, another letter! I gave them my agent's name and number for them to call for the info, which he did. A month later, the same letter! Again a call to another person and again a call to the agent. This week I received a letter telling me when they would start charging my account for the insurance. Aaaarggghhhh! This time I brought the insurance info to my local BOA branch and they FAXED it. I am now awaiting confirmation that they received it and the nightmare ends. Oh, until July when the cycle will start again.At best, they are totally incompetent. At worst, they do whatever they can to collect insurance money at grossly inflated rates.We have four accounts in the bank and despite all the inconvenience of switching to another institution, we are thisclose to doing so!","1154":"My wife and I both have separate checking accounts with different banks, however, we have a joint savings account for extra money that we need stored away for the important stuff. We\u2019ve been using a Bank of America savings account for a little over 2 years now. The staff there have treated us both with an amazing amount of kindness, and have even made the experience as a whole a more personal one. It was definitely something unexpected from a traditional bank. Not only that, but we have been able to take advantage of their cash back feature every once in a while, and even then it still helps the two of us save. Bank of America has been great.","1155":"The interest rates for this card are great and are entirely justified by the quality of the credit card service you obtain. My mother has been using this card for years and she is entirely satisfied. This card has bailed out my family in substantial financial circumstances and we are grateful for that fact.","1157":"The BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is not a card for everyone, sinceit does require a good credit history; but the benefits are great. New customers getan introductory rate of 0%. For people who use their credit card frequently, andtypically pay the balance in full or carry a small balance this card is perfect.Just by using the card, you are getting money back into your pocket. The addedsecurity and travel assistance features are also a big plus.","1158":"I\u2019ve had and enjoyed my Amtrak card from Chase for long. They gave me about 10,000 free points for signing up, and I have a very low APR (about 13%). My credit score has been Good and Excellent, which might be why I have such favorable terms with them.","1156":"I love this card from Bank of America. It gives me so much cash during the year, that I barely have to save up for Christmas. It gives that little extra boost. It also helps if you drive for the majority of your living. The only thing I did not like about this card was that you can only transfer over in $25.00 intervals. With my Capital One card, I can transfer over as much as I want, whenever I want. I also did not like the fact that you could only receive the $100.00 bonus if you signed up online. I would have liked to speak to someone in person about the card, but really wanted that $100.00 bonus for signing up and spending $500.00.","1159":"I had opened a Bank of America account many years ago and decided that I need to have a place to put my savings so this way it would help prevent me from the spending the money I had in my account. I saw how simple the Bank of America savings account was and decided that I should just open this to go with my main checking account. It's been really nice to not have a monthly fee as I keep my amount over the $300 needed and has really helped me save that extra penny. It's been great so far and I've found that I can easily save more money by having it!","50":"Recently changed credit card to Bank of America because during the Holiday Season is the time that credit cards have special promos. I went and googled the words credit card comparison and the top one was Bank of America for those with excellent credit. They do a 'Hard' credit check and it was the first time I found out my score: 750. B of A is the best to switch to before the end of the year because #1 100 Cash bonus when you make at least $500 in purchases within 90 days, #2 The cash back rewards is for ALL purchases and is divided into three rates, 1%, 2% and 3% which make it totally hands down as the best card to get for the most cash back rewards. :):):):):):):):):)","51":"The BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is very similar to other travel type cards, but to max out the benefits you should get a Bank of America bank account as well for the added 10 percent bonus. Really similar to the Amex card, but there's some places that don't accept it and this one is on the Visa\/MC network which has lower fees to merchants, so you might like this one better if you go to small corner stores and such in your travels to make sure they'll accept it. It was the one thing I didn't like with the competing Amex card, was small places or places running on thin profit margins didn't take Amex because it cost them an extra hundred basis points on their swipe rate.","55":"The AAA Member Rewards Credit Card seems like a fairly typical credit card. Compared to other cards I've had it is definitely lacking the incentive of an initial introductory rate. The annual percentage rate is comparable to most cards I've used over the years and seems fair. The extra bonus points on travel related purchases is a good deal if you find yourself on the road frequently. The card doesn't have an annual fee which is a very nice perk for a credit card. Overall the AAA Members Rewards Credit Card, looks like a great card, especially for travelers.","54":"I use this Bank of America credit card for general purchases as well as auto payment for several monthly bills. I've always had great customer support, and the points reward is a major bonus. Each year I have approximately $300 worth of reward points built up that make for a nice end of the year bonus. Bank of America is also great when it comes to credit limit increases and fair interest rates. Overall, I would definitely recommend this card.","52":"The Amtrak guest rewards credit card is a great card to utilize in my opinion, due to the fact one could earn Amtrak guest rewards points for every purchase (and double for purchases on Amtrak). The customer service is fair and responsive; furthermore (both on the telephone and on the web) it much easier to navigate than my other credit card.","53":"The nice thing about the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card is pretty obvious - the rewards. Particularly the initial bonus of $100. After that, earning 2% and 3% for gas is pretty generous as well. The initial interest rate is great - 0%, but be careful after that intro year. If you are able to qualify for this card, I would suggest using the first year to get the great rate and rewards, but after that apply for a card at a credit union. Their rates are almost always lower and their fees are usually lower as well.","56":"The BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature card looks like a pretty standard rewards card to me. Excellent credit needed and the low end interest rate of 12.99% isn't great but not horrible. Personally, I would rather have a defined cash back card than have reward \"points\". The reward details say that rewards start at 2,500 points but the reward list is not available. I found a Fidelity Amex card with 2% cash back on all purchases. That money can be put into a \"Cash Management\" (Checking) account or Retirement Account. There are plenty of positives with this card and getting rewards are better than not, but I believe there are better rewards cards out there.","57":"I have been BofA customer since 2011...So far the best bank from my point of view. I am so happy about being their customer. Easy balance transfer and Cash deposits..Wonderful customer care and the agents are very helpful and assisting every time I call. Very low interest rates and rewards system are some of the main options to consider this bank. Then I recommend all my friends and neighbors to be a customer of bank of america. Every store accepts the credit cards offered by them and so far no complaints about anything..Just love the way they are and I hope they serve every customer a good customer care forever..","58":"This BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is one of those credit cards that people who do not qualify point to as the ones they wish they could have. Once you get past the required Excellent credit rating, you're looking at a card with excellent reward potential. For starters, simply spending $500 within 90 days of opening the account will earn you $100 off your next travel purchase. Following that, you'll earn 1.5 points per dollar spent, which as they seem proud to say, truly is 50% more than most other rewards programs I've seen (1 point=1 dollar) Also, if you combine this card with a valid Bank of America account, you'll earn a 10% bonus to the points you've accumulated. So, if you have a Bank of America account already and you like to travel (and you have Excellent credit) this is definitely the card for you!","59":"Rewards for gas and travel purchases make the AAA Member Rewards Credit Card a favorite of travelers everywhere. With rewards also including gift cards and even vouchers for car repairs, you cannot go wrong! Though the points for purchase and interest rates are just average, Smart Chip technology ensures your purchases outside the border are 100% secure. The card does not require excellent credit either, making it a popular choice among those with a less-than-perfect history and a favorite among loyal AAA members.","240":"The $100 bonus and 2 and 3 percent back on groceries and gas respectively sure beats the 1 to 1.5 percent typical of most other cards Rewards' programs. Signing up for the card includes the standard 0 percent introductory APR that is common with most others, while Interest rates are just average. Overall, the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card is a great everyday card for consumers with excellent credit that like to rack up points while paying the balance off in full each month.","243":"The BankAmericard Cash Rewards card does offer some attractive rewards, but I do feel there are better rewards programs out there. The 2% and 3% cash back for groceries and gas purchases limits you to the first $1500 purchased, which can be reached in two to three months. The $100 bonus is nice and may make this card more rewarding for the first year only. I currently receive 1.5% cash back with my Capital One Quick Silver card which will earn me more cash in the long run. The balance transfer offers and yearly APR\u2019s with the BankAmericard are similar to other credit cards. If you\u2019re not a big spender with your credit card then I would definitely recommend BankAmericard.","242":"The AAA Member Rewards Credit Card is a great traveler's card to keep on hand during vacations or semi-regular use at home. The card requires a good to excellent credit rating and has APR's ranging from 12.99% to 22.99%, which is slightly lower than average.The card does not feature an introductory APR for purchases, but does offer an introductory balance transfer rate of 2.99% for 12 months. This option makes the AAA Member Rewards Card a decent option for consolidating other credit debt onto one card.The card also features a meager rewards program which earns one to three points per dollar spent. Don't expect to earn much back on the program, but it is better than zero return.This card also has smart chip technology making it easier to use the card abroad!","241":"I'm really pleased with all the experiences ive had with my bank of america saving account. I've been banking with them since i was fifteen years old, was recommend to bank with them by my parents as they have been with them for years. It works exactly the way i need it to, has a decent interest rate and has enabled me to save a sizable amount of money. I would recommend this account to my friends or anyone for that matter. Here in new jersey where i live there's a bank of america everywhere including at least 3 in my town alone, with one right on the corner!","244":"I have been a Bank of America customer since they bought out Fleet bank on the east coast. I am a big fan of their nationwide branches, as I live on the west coast but have family on the east coast, and I love traveling. I have never had a problem finding an ATM in the cities I've lived in. I even lost my wallet once in Portugal and they were able to wire me money from my checking account to pick up at a Western Union location nearby. This fantastically convenient service allowed me to continue with my trip instead of it becoming a disaster. I could not be happier with my account here, have had no major issues and they have been there to help me when I was down. Thanks.","245":"The only real downside to the BankAmericard Travel Rewards card is being able to qualify for it, as not everyone will be able to be so lucky. However, for those that are able to get their hands on it, this will be the perfect piece of plastic for any time you need to travel. The rewards are great and are non-airline specific, making it a step up from many of the other travel cards out there.","246":"Bank of America is one of my favorite banks. Living in NYC, there are ATMs literally everywhere you go within a few blocks of one another. I have a checkings, savings and credit card account at this bank. I really like the checkings account here because although there is a $12 monthly fee, it is not charged if you have at least one direct deposit coming in for $250 each month, which is extremely easy when you're working. When you are a student, this fee does not occur at all which is super helpful while in school. Whenever I have problems with my card, I call and they are immediately resolved so customer service is top-notch.","247":"This checking account is pretty ideal for my needs. I usually try to avoid banking fees at all costs, because it is an unnecessary expense for me, and impedes my ability to save. I only had $150 to open the account, meaning didn't have the $300 to avoid the fee. Luckily they provide another way to avoid it: a $25 monthly transfer from my checking account. I have direct deposit from my job, so this is all very automatic and convenient. At this rate, I can turn off the monthly transfers in a few months if I choose, but I think I will keep them going. The yearly interest rate isn't really a draw for me, as I don't think I'll ever have enough in the account for it to make much of a difference. Overall though, the account is super convenient, and I can make manual transfers between accounts online, and luckily, Bank of America ATMs are ubiquitous, adding to the convenience. I've had the account for about 3 years, and I've never had to contact their customer service, so I can't say much about that. All in all, I'm very satisfied.","248":"I have a Bank of America savings account. I have had good luck with it: it's linked to my checking account to provide overdraft protection. One thing I like is the ability to transfer money back and forth from savings to checking and vice versa. The transfers are effective almost immediately. I do all of my banking online and Bank of America has always been a secure site for me, which is another plus for this account. The only complaint I have is that the interest rate is so low as to be almost meaningless. But I believe this is a reflection of industry-wide low interest rates.","249":"The BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature card is really good compared to a lot of store cards or Discover. Every accepts Visa, and if you remember to put $500 through it in the first 90 days you get a $50 bonus, which isn't that hard to do in 3 months. A friend of mine uses his for everything, then spends the points on holiday gifts towards the end of each year. Personally I like the Amex One card, where you just get 1 percent of everything put in a special savings account you can withdraw in cash. It can be a little difficult to figure out the cash value of points you get, but I don't think it's as much as the one percent. Their rates are pretty good depending on your credit. I heard the new ones have a lower max limit, but I think that's true of every other card too after the economy problems hit.","1800":"I have had a CampusEdge checking account with Bank of America since 2009. Since then, they have provided exemplary customer service. I have no monthly fees and have gone these past five years without any problems from Bank of America. Once I was give a \"fraudulent charge\" warning from an online vendor I frequent. Bank of America reacted very quickly and made sure I had a temporary card as soon as possible (with the replacement coming in the mail). Although I rarely need one, there are a plethora of ATM machines; plus, the BoA branches and online banking options are very convenient. Overall, I have been very satisfied with Bank of America's checking account service. I would recommend it to anyone in need of a checking account service.","1802":"Bank of America has some really despicable business practices. Yet that goes for saying with all major United States banks. My checking account was supposed to be charge free, the banking rep who signed me up also assured me it was free yet fine print apparently said otherwise.Clearing that up was a long and frustrating process. But thankfully I got that cleared up and beyond that everything is ok. I mean bank of america locations and atms are everywhere. The card is also universally accepted. Direct deposit is through your employer and online is also excellent; online direct deposit is especially quick and easy Yet I still don't really trust them with my money. Thank God for the FDIC.","1803":"Requiring an Excellent credit score for approval for the BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card makes this card out of reach for the average consumer, and even if you're fortunate to have an Excellent rating, the incentive program will mean jack if you don't travel much. At least the added security and travel assistance features make sense considering the intended consumer base. The fact that this card allows for cash advances and credit transfers is another welcoming feature. (I do find it amusing that options mobile alerts and paperless statements are mentioned--I imagine that those are standard features for most cards.)","1801":"Bank of America was my first checking account, and it is by far the best checking option I have encountered. I have overdraft protection options, so if I make a mistake and spend a little too much, I don't get penalized for it; they just transfer the funds. I have two accounts, one with Bank of America and one with Wells Fargo, and I fully plan to stick with Bank of America and drop the other. Wells Fargo has too many \"rules\" to hold a checking account and bombard you with fees, unlike Bank of America. ATM's are everywhere and they have excellent customer service. I had someone use my account to purchase a magazine subscription and they were able to fix everything within a matter of minutes!","1805":"I had this card for 2 years but cancelled last week. The rewards were not worth the interest rate in my opinion, cash rewards accumulated very slowly and could not be redeemed until a minimum was reached. The zero percent interest rate was only for one year and then it was 24%. The website was easy to use, however, it was challenging to find the rewards page; also, I attempted to set up direct deposit of my rewards into a non-BOA account but was never successful. The BOA customer service reps were always very nice and helpful and when I cancelled the card, I found it to be surprisingly easy to do so. Overall, I would recommend BOA and would recommend this card for users who charge large amounts often.","1806":"This was my very first credit card, I got it when I was 18 and I\u2019ve had it for 10 years! I recently used my Bank of America credit card to transfer a balance. The balance was on another high interest card, almost 20% APR! The interest was killing me and I couldn\u2019t get ahead. The balance was $2,000 + 20% APR, you do the math. I transferred the entire balance with only a 4% balance transfer fee and it\u2019s interest free for a year! That is awesome because it will give me plenty of time to pay off the balance. It was easy to do, I did it all online in under 10 minutes.","1804":"I think the BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature Credit Card is a bit above the rest! Their reward system is really top notch, especially when you compare it to other cards! They have a great 0% interest intro rate for the first year and they don't charge any annual fees. Their regular interest rate, at 12.99% to 22.99%, is on the low end to average, compared to other credit cards. Their cash advance rates are rather high, but still within range of normal fees. They also offer ShopSafe, which is protection for shopping online. I would really enjoy having this because I do a lot of my shopping online and my privacy and security is always a concern! Overall, I think this is a really great card that you could use for rewards purposes!","1808":"I love the BankAmericard Cash Rewards card. Not only does this card have decent interest rates, but you also get a 0% intro rate for 12 months which is convenient when you want to make a large purchase. The cash rewards system is superior to others like Chase or Capital One because you get 2% on groceries and 3% on gas instead of 1-1.5%. They also start you off with a $100 bonus! Who can ask for more? It\u2019s a free $100 for getting an amazing card with a lot of great features. I will be applying for this card in the near future.","1807":"AAA Member Rewards Credit Card is a good credit card to get but i am quite partial to AAA they have helped me out of more than one bind in my life. There is no annual fee for this one which is great because there is a lot of cards that do have that annual fee so it's always good to get one without it so you don't have to worry about that. The places to shop at to get the rewards points is also much more useful than a lot of other cards because it's for purchases at places everyone shops at on a regular basis and not some strange store you don't visit often. Also it has rewards that are really useful and not just junk like a lot of other cards, AAA vouchers good for travel, even car repairs...or choose merchandise, gift cards or 1% cash back. All very great options, this list goes on with this cards perks i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a card.","1809":"The BankAmericard Travel Rewards credit card appears to be one of the most prestigious and well-acclaimed credit cards currently available on the market. It offers great travel rewards through a generous points system, 24 hour emergency assistance, paperless statement options, and even overdraft protection on linked Bank of America checking accounts. The only notable downside to this credit card is the fact that it's somewhat hard to obtain, since it is only available to consumers who have an excellent credit history. Overall, however, the BankAmericard Travel Rewards credit card is the perfect choice for anyone who has a history of stellar money management and also enjoys traveling and exploring.","2383":"I quite like the AAA Member Rewards Credit Card. There is no annual fee! Their interest rate, at 12.99% to 22.99%, is definitely a big draw! Much lower then other comparable cards! I believe their reward points are absolutely superb. You can also earn AAA vouchers for traveling, car repairs, merchandise, gift cards or 1% cash back as part of their rewards. Their cash advance rate is rather high, but if you stay clear of that, I really think this is a great card. If you're an everyday traveler, like myself, it's just a must have for saving money. They also have an option for paperless billing and I feel as though not enough credit cards offer this.","2382":"The BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card is a pretty good card. I don\u2019t bank with Bank of America but this card does have some good benefits. The 3% cash back on gas and 2% cash back on groceries really add up. I do wish it wasn\u2019t limited to the first $1500 you spend each quarter. I spend more than that on groceries and gas. But it\u2019s worth signing up just for the $100 you get for spending $500 within 90 days. For me, it\u2019s a good enough reason to sign up for another credit card. However, the Chase Freedom card did give me $200 for signing up and spending $500 so this offer isn\u2019t quite as good.","2380":"Bank of America is terrible, plain and simple. The fees are outrageous and the customer service sucks. Any big corporation only wants money and they treat the customers like numbers. I've had nothing but issues with them from the get go, between bogus charges, even down to switching my address was a pain with them. I haven't been a member of BOA in years, so maybe things have improved, but at the time the only good thing about them was the convenience of them being at \"every corner.\" I switched to a credit union a long time ago, and will never switch back.","2381":"Bank of America is a great bank if you live in an area where they are popular but if you ever move watch out! Growing up in Southern California I always had a savings account at Great Western Bank and when it became time for me to get a checking account I also went there. In the 90's Great Western was absorbed by Bank of America and I became a \"valued\" customer of BoA. All was well until I joined the Air Force and got stationed in Okinawa, Japan. On the west coast I could find Bank of America ATMs everywhere, from the grocery store to Petco Park but on an overseas military base all the ATMs were operated by Community Bank, a division of Bank of America. However, Bank of America did not recognize Community Banks ATMs as their own and charged me a $2 ATM fee every time I withdrew money. Since most Japanese stores did not take American credit\/debit cards at the time, I would sometimes see over $40 in ATM fees on a monthly statement! As a young A1C making less than $500 every two weeks, $40 was a brutal charge. After contacting customer service and telling them my dilemma they instructed me to either withdraw a large sum of cash at one time or change my bank. Needless to say, I am no longer a customer for Bank of America.","2387":"The Bank of America BankAmericard is an excellent credit card. I was given 0% APR for the first 12 months and the rewards are excellent 3% cash back on gas purchases, 2% at grocery stores and 1% on everything else. The rewards add up and they add 10% to your racked up rewards if you withdraw your rewards to an existing Bank of America Checking or Savings account. Also it is a VISA card so it is accepted at almost all places. It also offers $0 annual fee which s a great thing. I highly recommend this credit card to anyone looking for a good rewards card that is from a reputable bank.","2386":"This is a great deal! This BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature Credit Card gives you a $50 bonus and then 1-3 reward points per dollar you are really going to get rewards fast. The 3 points gas and groceries will really help me out since I need to purchase these items anyway. Also the introductory interest rate is really awesome and a great perk for signing up. The 2500 points to start out with is awesome as well not to mention that you are never capped when it comes to points. As many as you can earn in a year you can keep! I've had good luck with Bank of America, they seem to be everywhere and are always able to offer sweet deals!!","2385":"I've been banking with Bank of America since I was in high school and honestly I am planning on switching from them soon and closing my account. It seems like I'm always having problems with them. I feel they don't protect my account from fraudulent activities as well as they should. I also feel as though they pick and choose when they want to charge overdraft fees if I accidentally overdraft my account. I notice sometimes they will quickly process transactions just to charge me an overdraft fee. At times they will process a transaction the same day it takes place on my account whereas normally the transaction would take a couple of days to process.","2384":"I have been with Bank of America now for almost 17 years. My husband and I have had nothing but fantastic customer service from them. We have their Debit\/Credit Cards and regular Credit Cards and we feel safe with our money all the time. It was a couple of years ago around the holidays when our Debit\/Credit card had been compromised, and the Bank of America customer service person was so helpful and fixed all of the issues we had within ten minutes on the phone with us. When the issue happened I thought for sure it was going to ruin our Christmas Holiday, but thanks to the Awesome Customer Service Person our Christmas Holiday was safe, and so was our Bank Account.","2389":"I have been using Bank of America's savings account for approximately 2 years. This is a relatively straight forward type of savings account with the interest rate being standard. I'd recommend such an account for those that are not looking to pile a bunch of money into savings account as the interest rate is relatively modest. I really enjoy the online savings feature, which saves lots of time and hassle with depositing, tracking, and withdrawing funds. Also, there are some fees if you do not have at least 300 dollars in the account, so be careful if you're actively withdrawing from your savings. Overall, Bank of America offers a great service for those that are saving a modest amount of money. I'd highly recommend it.","2388":"I signed up for Bank of America's savings account after they had a promotion of rounding up purchases to the nearest dollar and depositing that into the account. Thus far, I have no complaints. I've had it for a couple years now and everything has run relatively smooth. I don't usually have a lot of money in the savings account, but I try to keep as much in there as possible. In the event I have to pull some out, the process is tremendously easy. The interest rate is reasonably modest, especially for what I'm currently using it for. I really have no complaints about it. It's certainly a great system, thus far.","1441":"I have been a Bank of America customer for over 15 years now and have not been disappointed. I feel like they get a bad rap, but I have never had any problems with this checking account and checking my balance, making transfers, ordering checks, etc. online is super easy. On two separate occasions when I lost my card, they sent me a replacement card very quickly. The only complaint I have with this checking account is the monthly service fee. You would think that after so many years as a loyal customer, it could be waived. Overall, it is a solid product and Bank of America is a good bank.","1440":"This is probably the most convenient checking account I've ever had--ATM's are everywhere and you can just pop cash (or your checks) into them for easy deposits. When paired with their credit card I get auto-debited cash rewards, usually monthly, which are a nice added source of income. Only issue I've ever had was a fishy e-mail that told me my account was wiped, but Bank of America confirmed it was just a glitch (they didn't go out of their way to correct the issue with me, I had to physically call them). There's also quite a bit of pressure to open up an account with Merrill Lynch to do some investing with them, but it's not overly aggressive (just a bit persistent).","1442":"The BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature Credit Card seems to be a great card. However, those with less than perfect credit may not qualify for it. There is a $50 cash back bonus after $500 in purchases within 3 months. There is a 0% liability for fraudulent purchases and it offers chip technology and over draft protection, The grace period is 25 days which is nice as well. Another perk is that reward begin at just 2,500 points. You also earn points on everyday purchases such as gas, grocery, and drug store. The card has no annual fee and unlimited points per year.","1443":"Bank of America\u2019s Way2Save helped me save effortlessly. I was already using my card for purchased and rounding up made it easier and I never missed the money. On my anniversary date they even matched what I had saved and deposited it into my saving account. On my own I always seemed to find something to spend the extra money on and would never put it into savings but with Bank of America\u2019s Way2Save I finally saved enough to take my daughter and on a much needed vacation. I\u2019ve recommended this program to all my friends and family and they have reaped the same benefits as well.","1444":"I had no real problems with Bank of America's savings account. I know you hear a lot about B of A being bad but, at least for simple banking, there were no problems. I do most of my banking online and rarely go into the branch so I can't say much about banking in person. Online though worked great for me. I sometimes forget to transfer money from savings to checking so I liked that by default my accounts were set up to automatically transfer money from my savings to my checking if I was short there.I try to stay on top of it but I have my bills set to autopay and sometimes I forget to check to see if I have enough to cover them. Bank of America never gave me problems. I did have another bank I used that somehow found this behavior annoying and complained to me but not B of A.","1445":"I am NOT a fan of Bank of America in general, but their BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card really is one of those credit cards that helps you as the consumer out. No annual fee, no signup fee, and mobile banking apps, this card is good to begin with. But, where this card helps us as the consumer out, is in the fact that you get cash-back for using your card! When buying $100 worth of groceries, you get $2 back. If buying $100 worth of gas, thats $3 back in your wallet. That might not seem like much, but after spending $1500 a month in gas, groceries, and other monthly expenses, this card can potentially put $45 a month back in your wallet. The drawback for some is this card is only for those who have REALLY GOOD credit scores.","1446":"If travelling by car is your standard means of transportation, the AAA Member Rewards Credit Card is an attractive credit card. This card has one of the lowest APR's at 13%. And with no signup fee or annual fee, it is a low maintenance credit card. As a member of AAA, you receive roadside assistance and other perks, and using this credit card gets you rewards for all of them. With a 3 point per dollar reward, you can quickly start raking up points in contrast to your regular visa card. However, if you really want to take advantage of rewards and travelling, this card does not compare to the Hilton Rewards Credit Card that gets you 3 points per dollar for gas and grocery's, and 6 points to be used towards hotel stays. What I like about this card are the rewards, whereas some cards only allows you to redeem points on merchandise, this card gives you options of cash-back or AAA vouchers.","1448":"I am very, very pleased with the Bank of America Bank Americard. I get cash on every purchase, and extra cash back on groceries and gas. The online interface is incredibly easy to use, letting me see exactly how much cash back I have earned with each purchase, what my balance is, and how much cash back I have earned in total. I can easily apply the cash back to my balance\u2014so in a way, it is a percent off my purchases! It is easier and faster to earn the rewards than with my Capital One Venture card. I have been using this card to make my every day purchases, and then paying it off at the end of every week. I would highly recommend this card!","1447":"BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is a good deal IF you have great credit and travel a lot. The initial bonus is nice, but $100 isn\u2019t that much when other cards are giving out $200 to $500 for signing up. The rewards are all focused on travel and consist of statement credits for those travel purchases. It is nice that is has a 10% bonus for Bank of America customers and no foreign transaction fees. If you do get this card, make sure you read all of the fine print. In my experience with Bank of America there are a lot of conditions that must be met which can get annoying fast.","560":"The BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature Credit Card is a great card for those with excellent credit. It not only offers such great usage rates in comparison to other cards I have used, but also allows you to accrue reward points. What initially drew me to this card was the $50 cash back bonus after $500 in purchases within 3 months. It wasn\u2019t the biggest discount, but it did help when I was financially burdened at the time. As an added benefit, this card has some of the best security available. Using Chip Technology in the card and Overdraft Protection, it gives me an extra layer of security that other cards don\u2019t.","1449":"The reason I chose Bank of America was that there is an abundance of branches all over the United States and their e-banking checking account allows me to just use the ATM's to do my banking and avoid large fees. My experience with Bank of America was amazing for four years until someone in their credit card department authorized payment for my credit card out of my checking account on a day that I was having surgery. My checking account didn't even have checks to begin with but the credit card agent in question \"created\" a check to pay a credit card account for someone else. Once I figured out what was going on I immediately notified my branch and the associates were amazing even helping me to find the necessary information so that I could file a police report for check fraud. Not so amazing was the fact that Bank of America's credit card division realized this blatant act of check fraud and refused to talk to me regarding the issue. I'm still waiting to get my money back and change my account while the police report is being investigated. I love Bank of America's checking support, but I would think twice about their credit card offers after this experience.","563":"Where to begin... I've had Bank of America checking for over 9 years. I'll give the plus's first. I USUALLY have no issues with monthly statements. I also like the fact that my statements are now paperless and don't clutter up my mailbox. With Bank of America pretty much everywhere, I can find an ATM pretty easily to withdraw cash when needed. Also, for those who go to China, Construction Bank of China is in partnership with BOA, so you can use their ATM's with no transaction fee. I also LOVE that I can deposit checks through their iPhone app. Quick, simple, and hassle free! Now for what I don't like about Bank of America checking. There are SOOOOO many hidden fees and maintenance charges. If I do not have $250+ direct deposits in my bank account each month, I get charged a penalty. If I take out of my savings more than 2 times a month, penalty. I changed my account type to an online checking only to avoid some of these fees, but if I now go inside the bank to a teller, I get charged a fee. I would change if USAA had a checking account in an instant.","564":"A lot of people have had problems with Bank of America, including myself and some family members. As far as MyAccess checking goes, I haven't had any issues. I have had missing deposits and other problems with my savings account which makes me nervous about the bank overall. The customer service definitely leaves something to be desired. You will be treated like a number on an account and not like a person. I don't know if this is a result of the employees having little control or what, but they don't seem to care about you or any issues you have with the bank. For this reason, I prefer smaller banks and credit unions, but I still have a BoA account because it makes other things easier such as making the mortgage payment which is through BoA","561":"MyAccess Checking from Bank of America is AWESOME! I believe they have more bank branches than any other bank, which makes it really convenient for many different reasons. They have so many atms and you can deposit checks and cash right into the atm. Also the employees are very nice to me and always have a smile on whenever I go inside to speak to someone. They also have an online chat feature available 24 hours a day to help you out. I honestly love banking with Bank of America, even though I do have checking accounts with other banks and a few credit union accounts Bank of America is my favorite!","562":"Every bank has an account similar to this. I think US banks equivalent is the silver account. When I worked at BoA, I had the advantage account for free. After I left, I got this myaccess account. This account is best for working adults that have direct deposit. The direct deposit requirement is so easy to meet if you are paid twice a month. This account is better than the ebanking and below the advantage account. The minimum daily balance is harder to meet since I have bills to pay but since I have direct deposit, it is no worries. I don't know how other people get fees but I have never got a single fee. The banking text alerts are really helpful to help track the spendings!","566":"This looks like a great card. I love how you get 3% back on gas because that will quickly add up in a three car family like mine. Having the cash directly deposited into your account is also a plus, as I have had headaches before with prior cards. It's a pain in the butt to have to wait for a cash reward check that takes four to six weeks to get to the house. The interest rate on the card is competitive compared to other cash rewards cards on the market, as long as you have decent credit. Otherwise, I can't see how cash back rewards will really pay off if you are paying 22% interest. As long as you keep a low balance and pay it off each month, this card looks like a winner!","565":"The AAA Member Rewards Credit Card has one of the best rewards hierarchies of a credit card, offering up to 3 points per dollar. This reward system doesn't exactly compare to cards from issuers such as Chase Bank or One who offer up to 6 points per dollar spent, but it's still decent. The interest rate on the AAA Member Rewards Credit Card isn't one of the best in the industry, but it will suffice for anyone looking for a general use credit card. If you're the type of individual who takes out frequent cash advances on their card, the AAA Member Rewards Card might not be for you as it has a 22.99% base cash advance interest rate.","2873":"I've had rental unit and home mortgages for over 40 years and, in total, have not had as many problems with any of the mortgage servicing organizations as I've had with Bank of America in the 3 years since they bought the mortgages on two rentals I own in Oregon.  In those three years, BoA has made numerous 'errors' that generate 'fees'  and necessitate hours (I time and record these calls so I'm not guessing) of telephone time (mostly on hold) while 'customer service' tries to get things straight.  In the last go around, BoA began taking the payments before they were due, then trying again when the payment was due and, because I only keep enough money for the monthly payment in the account for obvious reasons, they then charged 'insufficient funds fees' and 'over draft' charges.  To make matters worse, when I complained to Federal regulators, as provided by law, BoA employees began monitoring my Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter accounts (and heavens knows what else).In my capacity as a consultant, I recommend that any business or government having accounts or any relationship with Bank of America terminate it immediately.  One only has to Google 'Bank of America lawsuit' to get pages of reasons why.In my opinion, this company needs to be dissolved and the principals should face criminal and civil penalties.","567":"I have this Bank of America Power Rewards Card and love it. Getting a $50 initial bonus is fantastic with the option to earn points without limits. The initial $50 only requires spending $500 within 90 days, very easy to achieve. There is adequate protection with the cards chip I feel, and have not ran into any issues, especially with the 0% liability. The intro of 12 months 0% is great, but the max apr is high. If this credit card wasnt bank of america, it would get higher ratings. However, Bank of America has horrible customer service and lots of ways to try and rip of its customers.","130":"The BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is definitely loaded with benefits and is a neat option for travelers such as myself. By simply spending $500 during the first three days, you receive $10,000 bonus points which can be used to save $100 on an upcoming trip. In comparison, the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card requires that one spend $1,000 during the first three months for the same benefit. It's clear that the BankAmericard is a better option during the initial period and the benefits do not stop there. The card offers 1.5 points for every dollar spent after the Intro period although this is less than the 2 points offered by the Capital One venture card. There is an added 10% annual bonus for existing Bank of America account holders which is why I consider it preferable to the Capital One card. In terms of travel credit cards, I don't think you can go wrong with the BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card.","569":"I've had a Bank of America regular savings account for a couple years now, and it has worked very well for me. The interest rate is nothing to get excited about, but these days most banks are the same, unless you happen to have a LOT of money and don't plan on touching it for a while, so .01% interest is just fine. I got my savings account mainly as a place to keep money I don't want to touch, and it has been perfect for that. Customer service in my experience has been great, and I've only ever needed to contact them once because I can do basically everything I want all by myself online. Another great thing about Bank of America is just how well the separate accounts link together. I have my Keep The Change from my checking account round up to the nearest dollar and deposit in my savings, and then my rewards from my Bank of America rewards card deposit right into my savings, plus an extra 10 percent! I would give them 5 stars, but the interest rate is too low to warrant that. And yes, there are monthly fees, but only if you have less than $300. But if you have less than $300, why do you need a savings account anyways?","568":"When I lived in Charlotte, NC, I was with Bank of America, and we had a savings account with them. I was pleased with the service that we received. As with all banks these days, you are not going to get rich with a savings account, but the rates at BOA seem to be competitive. It is certainly better than having it in checking and earning nothing at all! (or accidentally spending it because you can't tell what you mean to save and what you mean to spend).The online banking feature worked very well, and helped me keep up with balances, deposits, and withdrawals very easily. If you are serious about saving, BOA's savings accounts are a great place to start. They are a solid bank, in these worrisome times, and that is always a top consideration when you are deciding where to place your money!","131":"With a slightly better than average rewards point system and surprisingly reasonable interest rates if your credit is good, the AAA Member Rewards credit card is a solid card to use should you travel a lot. With 3 points per dollar on travel expenses and AAA purchases, and 2 points per dollar on gas, if you're frequently on the road this card could be quite handy. Compared to a lot of rewards cards which offer a maximum of 2 points per dollar on specific purchases, the AAA Member Rewards card will help trim a bit more change off your travel costs.","132":"The BankAmericard Cash Rewards credit card is a great card if you qualify for the low interest rate. At 13 percent interest it's much lower than most credit cards. The cash advance rate is even a little lower than the standard 25 percent. Initially what I signed up for was the hundred dollars back after your first five hundred dollar purchases. It was a great deal and basically free money if you pay off the balance at the end of the month. I ended up keeping the card because of the great point system. Compared to my Chase Credit Card this one is a step above. The 1 percent reward on every purchase really adds up at the end of the month.","135":"I have had the Bank of America Visa credit card for the past two years and have enjoyed it so far. The rewards are better than my Capital One credit card and Bank of America offers varying rewards for near by stores. When I first signed up they offered zero percent interest for twelve months which was nice since I just moved and needed to buy new things in the area. Also the cash back on purchases gives a bonus if deposited into a Bank of America checking account. The only downside that Bank of America seems reluctant to increase my credit limit even though I do all my banking through them.","133":"I have been using the Bank of America Platinum Plus Card for several years now. I think that the best feature that it has is the SAFE online shopping. You can go to their website and get a temporary one time credit card number. I do a lot of international purchases online, but I am always skeptical of using my credit card information online. This allows me to do it without fear of having my information stolen. They also have excellent customer service. There have been two times that I have received a phone call from them asking me about a purchase that I had made. The one time it was because It was something that was out of the ordinary, the other time it was a fraudulent charge. They saw this right away and canceled the card, and issued a new one.","134":"I find using my Master card to be great! It is low rate and is good to have on hand when I need it. I had an issue once and called the customer service and they were very helpful. I would recommend Master card to anyone. They have been great to me and to have for the last 7 years. They make it easy to read your statement and to go on line to check your card. I am glad I went with Maser card. It is nice to know that I am protected and have help whenever i need it. I also love that the customer service people are polite and can help you so fast. I always keep my card with me because I never know when i may need it and I am happy to have it.","136":"I know a lot of people have had problems with Bank of America and at times I also did not have the best experiences with them. However, when it came to their checking account my experience was quite positive. I generally only do stuff online so I am not that familiar with the in branch experience other than the one thing I'll mention below. For online though, I don't think B of A can be beat. Their website has always been very fast and easy for me to use.The one problem I had was while I was there, the monthly fee changed as did the minimum requirements. At the time I wasn't really using this account much and I had just graduated and didn't have a lot of money. I got a monthly charge for not having enough funds in my account to meet the minimum. Needless to say that this was not something I was happy about. So I went in to my local branch expecting to have to argue and complain and probably close my account and go through the hassle of moving somewhere else. Instead though, I was nicely treated and when I explained my problem, the lady I spoke to said that they understand and that she would refund the charge to my account and waive the minimum requirements for the next 6 months.I think most places provide good service or appear to when everything is going fine, but the way they treat you when something goes wrong is the real test and in that regard Bank of America really impressed me. I especially appreciated that they had flexible enough rules that they could accommodate the speed bumps everyone hits in their life.","139":"I love travel rewards cards. Perfect for that young professional who does not only travel a lot for business, but also for pleasure. The BankAmericard Travel Rewards card gives you $100 off of your next travel purchase. This is great, especially if you know you are going to take a trip in the coming months. This worked out well for me, as I was planning a trip home to visit my parents and after spending $500 within three months and getting the discount, my trip only cost my about $100. CRAZY. If you\u2019re looking for a good, basic travel rewards card, the BankAmericard Travel rewards is a great candidate.","138":"Bank of America MyAccess checking is fantastic. I've seen and heard a lot of people complain about the Bank of America, but I don't understand the reason why. They've always been fantastic to me. Almost every other bank I've used hasn't been nearly as good as Bank of America. The only complaint I have about them is the monthly fee of $12.00. But I guess that just comes with the territory when you're dealing with such a high level bank. So, like I said, they're fantastic, I truly enjoy their service and I'll be a Bank of America customer for the rest of my life.","137":"I've had a checking accounts with Bank of America since high school. The most convenient thing about having a checking account with Bank of America is the plentiful amount of locations and ATM's. One thing I wish they would improve is the quality of their customer service. There have been way too many times that I would have to wait a long amount of time to reach one of their representatives.Another thing I have an issue with are the maintenance. I originally signed up with a student account that had no fees. However, now that I have a regular checking account, the fees are way too much ($12), especially compared with other banks. Although I love the convenience of being able to find an ATM machine almost wherever I am, the fees make me want to switch banks.","703":"I have enjoyed having this card for the past 3 years with Bank of America. I have experienced great customer service and have taken advantage of the 0% intro APR. I was able to transfer a balance from another card and have it paid off due to my Bank of America card being interest free. I have also have taken advantage of being able to connect my other Bank of America accounts so I can use overdraft protection. I have not had any problems with my account and Bank of America wired me money from my credit card internationally when my card was lost.","702":"I received this Bank of America Visa card after opening up a checking account at Bank of America. I did not apply for the card; it came in the mail already approved. I do not know anything about credit but was excited to open up this card in the mail. I proceeded to spend recklessly and it wasn't long before I had nearly used up my $1,000 limit. Bank of America provides its customers with an easy-to-use website so I can keep track of how much I owe. This card seems to be a good one and they won't charge me interest for the first 12 months, so I can slowly pay them back and clear myself of this debt without having to worry about the bill rising too high. I think this is a fair credit card policy.","701":"The Bank Americard Power Rewards Visa Signature credit card actually looks like a decent credit card to have. The intro rate for 12 months is pretty standard at 0.0%, same with the balance transfer at 0.0%. It\u2019s a little disappointing that you only get $50 cash back after you spend $500 within 90 days of getting it. I know when I first got my American Express Gold card, I got $150 for doing a similar task. It\u2019s nice that there is a grace period for late fees of $25 because you never know when you might need some extra time to pay a bill. Overall, I probably would enjoy having this card to take advantage of the gas points at 3 points per every $1. That could add up pretty quick.","700":"I've had a Bank of America Regular Savings Account for most of my adult life and I've always been satisfied by the service. The account has a competitive interest rate which is an easy way to make a little cash while protecting your money. The account does have a $5 monthly fee but you can avoid that by keeping at least $300 in your account. I live in New York City and the bank has numerous local branches but I've also lived in Atlanta, Tulsa, and Denver and each city also had plenty of locations as well. Bank of America is a leader in the industry for a reason and I've never had any problems during my years as a customer.","704":"I have had this card for almost 4 years now. I really feel it that this card provide lots of attractive benefits like rewards points, having very good credit limit even you may not have high credit score. Most of the time whenever I used this card, I get better rewards as compare my other credit cards. Most of the time I pay my bill on time so never had any fee and penalties on my account so can't even think of any negative point right now. I think if I were to miss my payment and need more customer support, I would have given more feedback on that as well. I recommend this card to gain credit score and at the same time to get good cash rewards as well on general shopping.","705":"The Bank Americard Travel Rewards card is pretty great. For me it was an upgrade from my Bank of America card and I couldn't be happier. Unlike a lot of cards it doesn't have a limit on the amount of points you can earn in a year. It also doesn't have a yearly fee which has started to become more common with point reward credit cards. The interest rate of 14 percent is about standard but on the low side for a point card. The cash advance is a little lower than most cards as well at 23 percent. The best thing about this card however is the point system. The bare minimum amount of points you earn for every dollar is 50 percent more than almost every card, you can even earn triple on a lot of purchases. All this together makes for a really great card and I can't imagine switching to something else any time soon.","706":"I have had my card now for about 8 years. I cant think of really to much to say that is negative. I usually pay for things with my card and then immediately pay them off. I went on a trip and spent up 3,000 in credit and came home and took care of it. They never charge me for any services on it. One time I had a fraudulent charge of 2,500$ and they immediately took it off and made things right. The ONLY negative I feel about the card is I will sometimes get a maintenance fee and that is because it slips under the amount I am supposed to use. Other than that I think Bank of America is great and the APR is awesome. I really recommend checking this card out.","707":"The BankAmericard Cash Reward Credit Card must be the best credit card here, or at least is my favorite. It gives actual money back on purchases, and not just pennies, 2% back on groceries, and 3% back on gas is a lot, and it adds up over time. The fact that it gives $100 sign up bonus is super great. Some credit cards charge a sign up fee, this one actually gives you a bonus for signing up. And the APR is really good, the intro APR for the first year is 0%, but , and only 12.99-22.99 after a year which is not bad at all.The only thing I don\u2019t like about this card is that the cash advance fee is very high. But this can be avoided since most people don\u2019t get cash advances from their credit cards.","708":"Much like other cards bank of America allows you to obtain points for future rewards. I like the idea however that boa does not put a cap on the amount of points you can earn per year. I know that most people nowadays rarely use paper money and use plastic, so I'm sure that earning rewards makes this card a first choice rather than using regular cash..especially when you are able to use it at the pump!","709":"We got our Bank of America savings account over 15 years ago when we got married. I was a little concerned that such a large bank would be so impersonal. But over the years I have found this not to be true. I get such great personal service from everyone that works at Bank of America. I love the cash back program. I am able to save lots of money with this program and I don\u2019t even really think about it. Thanks to our savings account we have been able to purchase our first home and we couldn't be happier. Thanks for helping us along the way, everyone at Bank of America.","1420":"The BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card totally rocks. 24\/7 travel and emergency assistance is a great incentive. Compared to the Expedia Credit Card, this is tops. The first point of their reward details, $100 of your next travel purchase is awesome and a great help! Also, 1.5 points per dollar spent is 50% more than what other companies offer--hello, points! The fact that there are no limits to the card is a huge plus, as other cards do not offer this luxury! If you have a qualifying Bank of America account, you can also acquire 10% bonus points on purchases annually!","1421":"I've had my Bank of America MyAccess Checking account for 5 years now, and I do not have a single complaint. I've over-drafted once in my time here, and considering it was my first time, they wiped the charges clean. At the time, I was really in a bind so this was highly appreciated, as well as the understanding they showed when I was in person, talking to them about it. During my time here, I opened an account at a different (competitor) bank, but after a handful of transactions and a couple months later, I was very..very unhappy. Too many unexplained fees and things they just forgot to tell me about. If nothing else, I thank Bank of America for communicating with it's customers, whether it be a change in banking fees or just that you updated the website. A+!","1423":"The AAA Member Rewards credit card is pretty great. Compared to most cards it has a low interest rate at 13 percent but it does have the usual high cash back interest rate. The point system is also a little better than most cards with the added points for gas purchase. My Bank of America credit card has a standard one point across all purchase but the AAA card gives you a little extra on gas. The absolute best part of this card is the vouchers which are used every where. If you travel a lot this is a must have card. Renting a car, a room or even eating at a buffet just ask if there are any AAA discounts and you'll be surprised how many places have something for you. Altogether I'm happy with this card and plan on keeping it.","1422":"The BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card is a phenomenal card, but you have to have excellent credit to get invited to the show. This card has no annual fee, and its interest rate is surprisingly low. You can get the card at 12.99 percent at the lowest, but also up to 22.99 percent, which isn't as lovely. If you make $500 in purchases in the first 90 days, you get $100 cash back, which is a great perk. You also get cash back on every purchase, and more on groceries and on gas. There are other rewards cards, like the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card with similar perks, but this card offers to many what they are looking for -- low interest, high rewards. I highly suggest you look into it if you have excellent credit.","1424":"The BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature Credit Card is one of the best rewards on the market, and closely in line with some of the worst. Starting with the bad. This card has an unreasonably high cash advance rate. The normal interest rate for the Power Rewards card is very high compared to most other rewards cards; I currently have it with a 16 percent interest rate, but the rate can vary anywhere from 12.99% all the way up to 22%. The great thing about this card is its rewards system, and the sign up bonus. The requirements to receive the sign up bonus was very reasonable, and you can earn an unlimited number of rewards points that don't expire. Overall, the BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa is a great credit card once you get over its pitfalls.","1427":"I love the AAA card because it is unique and really stands out from the other cards. There are so many rewards programs and benefits for using this card, that it's hard to see why anyone wouldn't! for instance, for every dollar you spend on gas or food or even at a drug store, you earn 2 points on their rewards system. I think that is awesome. You can also earn 1 point on your purchases elsewhere. So basically, wherever you use this card, you will be earning points that count on their rewards system! The downside is that their rates are rather high. The cash advance rate is somewhere in the mid twenties. I find this a very bad rate and extremely unattractive for consumers like me. Overall, good card!","1426":"I have a BankAmerica Cash Rewards card and I can not think of very many things that stand out about this card. Everything is pretty average. There is a twelve month intro period with a good intro rate of zero percent, but that is a common offer these days. After that 12 month period it can from 12 to 24 percent. I do however enjoy the cash back program they have with this card. If you spend 500 bucks in 90 days, you will get 100 dollars cash back . That was something I really liked. There are little things like the foreign transaction fee that I do not like. Little things like that can add up. Overall a very decent, but average card.","1425":"I did not enjoy banking with Bank of America. They were extremely rude when I would come in for banking and they charge ridiculous fees causing my account to become negative once. I have since switched my checking account to Arvest and I am much happier with their policies and customer service. I would not recommend BOA to anyone. I have banked with many different institutions because of my job and this is the only bank that I have ever had any negative experiences with. I would say pretty much any other bank would be better than them if you have any other options.","1428":"I have had nothing but good experiences with my BoA Travel Rewards card. It was switched over from another card I had with them that they discontinued. Although this card is labeled a \"travel rewards\" card, the points earned can also be used to receive gift cards or statement credit, much like a \"cash rewards\" card. I do admit that the exchange rate is not as good as a standard \"cash rewards\" card when using it for those transactions though. The main reason for 5 stars with me is that Bank of America's customer service has been excellent. Twice, after calling, I got them to lower my interest rate just by asking. First down to 14.9% variable and then down to 10.9% variable! This makes it my lowest interest card and warrants the 5 Star review for me.","1429":"I have had a Bank of America Savings account for about 10 years now. I use it still consistently and enjoy the ease it has been to easily maintain it through the years. Their customer service is usually top notch and I rarely have a problem I can't figure out myself through the online support. I have also added some low return CD's through Bank of America and they have suited my needs very nicely. I love the fact that there are so many locations throughout the country to make it easy on me when I travel. I also recommend their savings accounts and programs to my friends when they ask for it.","840":"Decent card if you can get it when they have one of the promotions to get some cash back. It is okay if you have no other reward cards to use, but it is somewhat hard to be approved for this card in the first place so you might have better options available. Their point system is somewhat generic and bland, and there are better ones out there that you can probably apply for if you are qualified for this card. I would try to see what other options are available before resorting to this card. Overall, it is a pretty average card and don't expect too much out of it until you can apply for a better rewarding card.","841":"The bank of america power rewards signature credit card is a great credit card. The first six months I earned 3 points for every dollar that I spent at the gas station, grocery stores, and drug stores. I also like that they give you $50 for opening a credit card. Other credit card companies, like the chase sapphire or the chase sapphire preferred gave $100 for opening a credit card. The bank of america deal could be better. One thing that I wish they had was a longer period of the bonus rewards. Six months is a short time. Overall, it's not a bad credit card.","842":"This is only the second credit card that I've ever had (my first one being a Citibank Master Card). After having maxed out my first card, I needed a second card mainly just for minor monthly purchases. It turns out that I like this card much better than my first one. With the current rate at 10.24%, it probably isn't the lowest rate out there, but it is nice to have my credit card with the same bank as my other accounts (checking, savings, etc). The best thing is Bank of America's fraud protection on this card. Last year, their fraud protection office called and asked me if I had made a $200 purchase to \"Blizzard Entertainment\" (they run the World of Warcraft game). Of course I had not, and told them such. They instantly credited the money back to my card and mailed me a new card with a new account number. I was very happy and highly impressed with their proactive approach. Two thumbs up to this card!!!","843":"I had to switch to a big name bank for the sake of my job, and I chose BoA. I thought that Bank of America was going to be just another average bank, but I was wrong. The charges are not always clear, so be sure to read all the disclosures or monthly fees with randomly appear on your bank statements. The charges are not always the best, and the application took forever to get through. That being said, I have had a few issues with payments going through, and the customer service has been simply amazing. I have never had an issue with the problem resolution center and I highly recommend it if you love nice people at your bank to interact with.","845":"The only reason I can see to get the BankAmericard Travel Rewards credit card is to save on foreign transaction fees. Most cards will charge you around 3% to use your card overseas and those little fees can really add up quickly. The other thing that's nice is the 0% intro APR for an entire year. Other than that, this card has a high APR, requires excellent credit, and nickel and dimes you all the way. 10,000 bonus points if you spend $500 within 90 days... but that's only worth $100 in travel redemption! At 1.5 points per dollar, this card will rack up points faster than most rewards cards but it takes a lot of points to actually redeem them for anything.","844":"I've had a Checking account with Bank of America for over 15 years now. Their in-branch staff has always been pleasant and helpful. In recent years, they've applied significant pressure to get customers to utilize the automated phone system, online banking, and paperless statements. That pressure has not been pleasant and I'm considering moving to another bank. Many BOA account holders that I know complain about excessive fees, but in my opinion the fees are disclosed up front so there isn't much to complain about. Bank of America has been consistent over the years, but I don't feel as connected to the organization as I did in years past. Overall: B-","847":"I recently had a very positive experience with Bank of America. I was in Mexico and, stupidly, lost my atm card. I did not even realize it until the next day. I called BoA and told them what happened. Someone had used my card. So they cancelled that charge against my account and issued a new card. While I waited for the new card, I needed cash. So they wired me money through Western Union at no charge to me. I was really impressed at how they took care of me. And I feel really protected whether I am at home or traveling.","846":"Bank of America has to be one of the most secure and best banks out there. Yes it's really corporate and gets a bad rap sometimes, but it really is a great bank. I sell lots of things on e-bay and craigslist and get checks all the time. I used to have to save checks and travel to the bank to deposit them. Now with the Bank of America app I just snap a picture of the checks front and back and never have to leave home. The money is in my account the next business day. I'm just a simple check user and all I want is easy deposit and withdrawl options and a debit card accepted everywhere. I've always had courteous customer service, and would highly recommend B of A for anyone looking for an easy and safe checking account.","1714":"The AAA credit card is unlike a lot of cards our there right now, its not a store specific card, or a generic credit card, it is one for the traveling type! If you have long commutes or love to get out of your shell and go places this is a great card. The rewards you can get are mainly for traveling and things that go with traveling like gas, and food, and of course AAA travel purchases. Another nice thing is that you also get some rewards points from getting your car fixed, talk about awesome! This card has some foreign fees if you travel abroad but it still allows purchases out of the US as well. I myself am not much for traveling and like to stay local so I prefer a card more geared to physical purchases like the Amazon Credit Card, it has great rewards on all kinds of purchases. If you travel a lot, or want to start this is a great card to have on hand!","1711":"I've been with bank of america for over 15 years. I started our with my first checking account and now I have advanced business services with them. I've definitely had mixed experiences over the years but the reason I stay with them and recommend them is the customer service at local branches. You can go in and sit down with a real person who knows the system and will work with you to resolve any issues, set things up, etc. It may take awhile but you have an actual friendly person advocating for you. Because of this I stay with bank of america.Over the years I've taken my investments (IRAs, CDs, etc) elsewhere for higher rates and would not pursue anything other than a business loan with them but they will always have my business for their branch customer service. Online services, smartphone applications, live chat etc are all very helpful and I'm able to get what I need done. They're a little overzealous on the fraud protection but I guess that's a good problem to have. Small business services are also great!","1710":"I've always been happy dealing with Bank of America. I have several credit cards, a savings account, and a checking account with them. They have plenty of convenient branches very close to my home and work, and the online interface is very easy to use. When I need to go to my local branches, there are never any lines and they are able to take care of my issues very quickly.","849":"The banker removed a charge from my account. She saw that my former account was not meeting my needs. So, she waived my monthly charge and upgraded my account. We also discussed financing for my small business. She told me my options. I was not ready to open a business account yet. So, she gave me her card and told me to come back when I was ready to open a business account. Based upon her performance I will in the near future open that business account with Bank of America. Every time I go there I am meet with friendly faces and they immediate ask me why I am there.","848":"Bank of America has got to be one of the worst places to keep your money. I had a truly bad time with them. long story short I closed my account because I didn\u2019t want to bank with them anymore. There was way too many charges and it was just nuts how they would keep coming up with new ways to get a hold of my cash every month but that\u2019s not the bad part. After that a year later they tried to tell me that I had to pay them over 500 dollars. They never closed my account even after I went in and told them to. So over the course of one week, yes ONE WEEK, they charged up 500 dollars because my account was empty and one charge lead to over draft and they just kept adding more and more on. So don\u2019t ever bank with these guys.","1712":"I have had a Bank of America checking account for about five years now. Although I usually prefer small banks, I have been impressed with Bank of America. When I was trying to get a loan from them, I was able to meet with someone in the bank, and he was very honest about the situation. I was impressed with his customer service. It is very easy to access my account online and review charges. Compared to other banks I have used, their online services are easy to understand. I can view photo images of every check that I deposit. It is nice to be able to access a Bank of America ATM wherever I go.","1715":"The BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card is an overall pretty decent card to have in your wallet. There are a lot of extras that it provides that I don't get with my other cards like the smart chip technology that keeps you safe outside of the country. I will only bring it with me when traveling from now on. The % cash back on purchases is also very nice. I don't have this option on any other card I have. A downside that I find, however, with almost all cards is the fees given such as the foreign transaction fee and the late fee, but this is probably a likely thing with any card. Finally, no annual fee is quite nice. I have one on all of my cards :-(","1713":"I have been pleased with my Bank of America savings account ever since I got it. Their customer service has been great and when I have had any problems they've always worked with me to fix them. My favorite part of the bank is their Keep the Change program, where checking purchases are rounded up to the nearest dollar and the difference is deposited into your savings account. This is a great way to save some money and it is just change, at the end of the day. The application process was very easy and quick and before you knew it I was a member of the bank. I highly suggest you give them a chance. The bank might have its problems in other departments but the savings account has always worked out for me.","1717":"I had Bank of America for about 4 years before they completely screwed me over. I had a student checking with them, my first bank account ever. I was careful with my spending, but since I was still a student, I didn\u2019t spend much and had no bills since I was living with my parents. I mainly used the account to save my money and order the occasional item online. Then after not using my account for about 2 months, but having over $100 in it, I got three overdraft fees, which caused the account to go negative somehow. I went into a branch and tried to figure out what happened, but no one could tell me, they just said I had to pay them and get my account back in good standing. I didn\u2019t have the money to do so, and two days later, three more overdraft fees on the overdraft fees came through. I went up to the bank again and still there was no one who would help, not even the branch manager. I eventually just had to let the account close and pay it off later when I had more money.","1716":"I have written previously about how much more I like my current banking situation compared to experiences I've had in the past. That experience was with Bank of America, a bank that, in the two years I made the mistake of doing business with them, consistently screwed up my account. On at least three occasions, in two years' time, I would go on the website to check my balance to find a number that was very certainly not correct (and, of course, it was never in my favor). Having that happen was bad enough, but try to get them to do something to fix it and be prepared to wait, even if you happen to need the money to pay bills. They're simply too big to care about their customers.","1719":"This is a really good card for excellent credit. One thing I like about this card is for the first 12 months this has a interest rate of 0 percent, that is amazing. After the 12 months its around 12 percent if you have good credit. It also has a grace period for late fees of 25 days which is also good in case you're late past that it's a 35 dollar late fee. In case your card gets lost or stolen it has two features that are really good $0 Liability Guarantee, which helps protect you from fraudulent card transactions, and it also has an extra level of security with Shop Safe while making your purchases online you know you can be safe. Overall I would recommend this card to almost anyone very good card. BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature Credit Card is one of the best.","1718":"A few years ago I signed up with bank of america, for, well I really don't know why I chose to go that route. I was looking for a bank, and I figured the big bank of america would be a good one. Boy was I wrong. They unloaded tons of unnecessary fees on me and I had to get out of it fast. I even heard stories of Bank of America trying to implement some fee for using the debit card every month. I quickly cancelled my account and switched to a local credit union, and I haven't looked back since. They never added that extra fee, but the whole thing left a sour taste in my mouth so I'm glad I moved on.","750":"The BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is a Visa card that has a ton ofterms and conditions. If you do this then you get this % of this, etc. etc. Iprefer my rewards cards to be a little less .. diluted. You do get an initialaward of 10,000 points which will save you $100 off travel, but of course,there's a \"condition\". Spend $500 on the card within 90 days. Earn 1.5 pointsfor every $. Then here we go with the conditions again - 3 points for every$ spent for the first $6k in airline purchases (up to 9000 points). The good newsis that there's no limit to the points you can earn (at the usual reward rate)AND the points don't expire. You also get an extra 10% for having a\"qualifying\" Bank of America account. Tons of terms for a pretty high interestrate. I'll pass on this card. I don't have the time to sit and figure out how tomake it worth my time!","751":"I have been using Bank of America's MyAccess Checking ever since I started college and it was my first checking account. It started off as a MyCampus account for college students where I did not have to pay a monthly fee, but now that I'm out of college I have to pay a fee if I don't have a certain amount or if I don't deposit a certain amount every month (these amounts aren't that high if I recall.) Overall I think this is fair. I think the service is very good, especially the online banking. It is a very useful service to have due to its convenience. I have never had any problems with my account.","752":"I've had this checking account with Bank of America for probably four years now. It was one of the first accounts I opened as an adult. For the most part it is a fine checking account. It does what it needs to do and it doesn't give me any problems. Only once out of those four years did I have to call customer service, and that was due to external issues. The customer service was prompt and friendly and I had my new debit card within three days. You might be able to find better checking accounts out there, but if you just want a no hassle account that you don\u2019t have to worry about, I would suggest this one.","753":"When I was employed there, this was my first card. It is similar to most cash rewards cards. I choose this card since I have online banking and was able to see the variety of rewards. The 2500 points was an automatic $25 to my account and it was easy to set up. What i didn't like about the card is I only got $50 for a bonus since most days it is $100. The interest free period was really attractive and it was a good way to build credit. I would skip the regular rewards since the regular rewards took forever to redeem. Also some of the items were silly like kitchenware.","754":"The Bank Americard Travel Rewards Credit Card is alright compared to other travel credit cards. It does have no annual fee, which I am very big on. It gives you 10,000 Initial Bonus points for signing up. You will need a very good credit rating to get this card, also. It also has 0 percent intro rate for the first 12 months. I have the Chase Sapphire Preferred Credit Card and it has all of that but it gives you 40,000 Initial Bonus points for signing up. They both no foreign transaction fees, which is also great. I would recommend this credit card but there are better ones out there.","757":"The BankAmericard Cash Back credit card is another card in the lineup of rewards cards these days. It is also a very attractive option in its very straightforward rewards scheme. The bonus of $100 in the first 90 days if purchasing $500 of products is a nice perk. The rates are also comparable to other cards in its bracket, and based on your credit worthiness, you could get a quite good rate for a rewards card. Not having to worry about annual fees and the 0% annual rate for the first 12 months are a great reason to pick up this card if you are in the market for a rewards card.","755":"I opened an account with Bank of America a few years ago and it's pretty good. What originally attracted me to them was their size. They have branches everywhere, ATMs in every store and great online banking options. The process was simple to sign up and done quickly. The customer services is decent put I would never say great. I've had some problems with some transactions that could have been solved quicker but they did eventually get resolved. My favorite thing is the cost. I have a checking and savings account with them at no cost as long as I keep a hundred dollars in the bank. All together I really do like them I just wished they would be a bit more helpful.","756":"I think this card has some decent benefits but is also lackluster in other areas. The rewards system seems rather robust, offering between 1 and 3 points per dollar spent (depending on the items purchased). It also offers a 25-day grace period on purchases, which seems to be what other cards offer.If I had to choose something I don't like about the card, it's the percentage rate on balance transfers. I've seen other cards offer lower introductory rates on balance transfers, some going as low as 0. Everything else about the card seems to be in line with what other cards offer, which to me, makes this card a rather average offering.","758":"I got this card about 5 years ago to rebuild my credit a little bit. Even though my credit rating wasn't that good, I still got a really good rate from them. Customer service is always very helpful when I need to speak to someone, which isn't often. I also like the rewards program a lot. I've redeemed my points many times over the years and gotten some really cool stuff. They've been very forgiving to me when I miss a payment. It's happened a few times, and they always try to help me out so I don't get stuck with excess fees. As long as you pay the majority of your bills on time, you should never have a problem with this card.","1220":"I have found this card to be very dependable. The rate interest on the card is a bit high but that is ok. I can use it in my everyday purchases. I love that you can earn rewards with this card. I have had great customer care when i have needed to call them.I loved the 100 dollar sign up bonus they offer. I love if i have a problem there is someone in customer service to help you night or day. I would recommend to this card to everyone. This card was the best choice i have ever made.","759":"This is a great card for travelers like me. 3 points for every dollar spent for the first $6000 is a great offer, at least for me. 1.5 points for every dollar spent on purchase is a decent offer, but I personally know a few cards which offer such deals, in fact a bit on the higher end as well. Except for the travel and purchase offers, I don't see much benefits one would get out of the Bank Americard. Maybe we could add it in our kitty just for the sake of travel and use it for huge purchases as well. The Grace period is 25 days and thats great. I own a Chase credit card with grace period of 2 days and that really sucks! Overall, its pretty decent.","1221":"The BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature Card is great for people who make a lot of purchases on credit. The card offers a $50 bonus just for signing up. The card also has a rewards program in which spenders receive points for making everyday purchases. The points system is easy to understand and provides a bonus incentive to want to use your card. The online banking system is also clear and simple to use.","1223":"The BankAmericard Cash Back credit card is a good option for people who don\u2019t want to worry about annual fees or complicated rewards program. Overall, the rewards are decent for the card and it doesn\u2019t seem that difficult to get approved for the card. This was actually my first credit card and I was approved without any issues. The cash back is easy to use and there is also an additional reward amount added on if you choose to get the rewards deposited into a Bank of America checking account. Overall, this card is easy to use and a good introductory card that isn\u2019t too difficult to understand.","1222":"Bank of america is alright. Especially after the big banking crisis in 2008 I definitely see them under a different light. Not only that, they charged you ridiculous fees for everything. I am now getting charged 15 a month to use my checking account because I don't have direct deposit anymore. Not just that, but their customer service is extremely automated and outsourced to some other country where I cant understand the customer service representative. Its very annoying and I will switching banks soon so I am not support these big banks that get bailed out when they go bankrupt. Stay away from BOA.","1224":"The BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card is one of the best cards out there right now. You will be hard pressed to find better introductory rates when it comes to the interest or the rewards. They make it very easy to redeem your rewards and you get awesome value for your money spent. After the twelve month introduction period the interest rate is still one of the lowest around and makes it worth getting, and keeping. The cash advance option is nice to have for the chance that you will have an emergency pop up. It gives me peace knowing that if something ever DID happen, I would be covered.","1225":"I have never had an issue with my bank of america platinum credit card. I got it the day I turned 18, and have never missed a payment or had problems for the past 5 years. I'm sure if I were to miss a payment and need some customer support that I would have more feedback to give, but my rates have stayed consistent, I've had no unknown charges and my identity has never been stolen. Knock on wood of course, but I am very confident in my relationship with BOA and my credit card. I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to establish basic credit or who needs a smaller low-rate loan.","3501":"Bank Of America I travel alot, so I use BoA, to have easy access to ATM and cash only near my hotel area. It is my secondary account for travel only.","1226":"The Bank of America cash rewards card is one of the best credit cards that I have ever owned. With rewards back at 1% for all items, 2% for groceries, and 3% for gas, the more you spend, the more you save. The customer service that is online is phenomenal as well, being available at most hours of the day to assist you with making payments and seeing where your funds are allocated. You can even pay most of your bills online straight through BofA! The only problem that I can see with it, is it is somewhat difficult to navigate to where you are actually supposed to pay your credit card bill online. I would like to make multiple payments a month but i can never figure out how to do it and always require assistance. Overall, however, this card is great.","1227":"One of the things I always make sure I have in a travel rewards credit card is for it to have no foreign transaction fees, and the BankAmericard Travel Rewards Card definitely has this perk! The other benefits this card has is on travel purchase. You get 3 points per dollar on all your travel related purchases, though there is a cap on how much you can earn. I personally don't spend that much on travel, but others might. It also has the smart chip technology with it which is great if you are traveling overseas and want the extra security. This card is great if you travel a lot, but obviously avoid it if you don't.","1228":"I have had nothing but good experiences with Bank of America in my two years with them. When I first opened the account, it was a very easy application process and the staff was helpful with any questions I had. The online service and online bill pay they offer has been a big help and very convenient for me. In those instances where I have needed assistance or a question or two answered, the customer service has been both prompt and comprehensive. No matter the problem I may have had, they have always handled the issue to the best of their ability. Bank of America has been a godsend.","1229":"The BankAmericard Rewards Card is not a good credit card. They entice you with some nice introductory offers such as a $50 bonus after spending $500, and 3% on gas for the first 6 months. After that everything gets 1% back on all purchases. For comparison, the CapitalOne Venture card offers 1.25% back on all purchases, and also has no annual fee. I would say you're better off getting that card if you are looking for a credit car to have in your wallet for a long time and not just 6 months. 1% is pretty standard for rewards card, and that is exactly what this card is.","270":"The Bank of America cash rewards credit card is a great card, I have had the card for 7 years now and I have not had a problem with their service. There website is well laid out and easy to use. The customer service staff at their toll-free number is friendly and knowledgeable when you call it. They have given me a reasonable credit limit that I feel fits my needs. They did not offer me a large amount that I might be tempted to over spend. Their rewards program is great, I get extra bonus cash back on purchases that I make regularly which is a nice way to offset the interest.","271":"The BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is a pretty average to below average card in my opinion. As said in the name of the card, this is suited for travelers. Since I don't travel too much, this card isn't too beneficial for me. I like the no annual fees, but this card just doesn't offer too much at all for non travelers. Even for travelers, I feel the rewards are somewhat minuscule. APR can be high, and overall I feel that there are far more cards out there that are better than this one. Even when it comes to traveling, there are better travel cards than this one, with more traveling benefits, and other benefits as well. I recommend not getting this card, and opting for something else.","273":"The AAA Credit Card has some nice benefits to a regular credit card. If you are planning on doing any travel, the 3% you get back can be very nice. They also offer 2% back on gas, grocery and drug store purchases. There are no limits to the amount of points you can earn either, which makes this much better than other cards that have a focus on travel. The 1% back on every day purchases means you might not want to use this as your every day card, so consider using something else such as Chase Sapphire or Capital One Venture that give you a little bit of a bonus on top of 1% on every day purchases with no annual fee.","274":"The BankAmericard Cash Rewards Card boasts about some pretty sweet rewards. 3% back in gas, 2% back on groceries, and 1% back on everything else. This seems very tempting, but the fine print says that you are limited in those bigger bonuses up to the first $1,500 spent in all categories every quarter. After that only 1% cash back applies. I personally spend $1,500 on my card each month, so for me I recommend the Capital One VentureOne card that gets 2% back on everything with no limits to what you can earn. This is only good if you don't spend that much money to reach the caps on rewards.","272":"Bank of America has been very great and helpful to me. They allow me to do all of my banking with no hassle whatsoever, and I have never had an issue or a problem. Every time I've gone in to Bank of America, the staff is very nice and happy. They are never \"too busy\" or \"in a rush\" and they always seem warm and inviting, ready to help me with anything I need. Overall this is a great company and I'm very glad I decided to get a Checking and Savings account with them. Bank of America is a bank I would very much recommend for a Checking or Savings account.","275":"I have used my credit card through bank of america for going on three years now. I haven't had any problems with this credit card yet. They offer me low interest rates and great perks for making my payments on time and keeping my balance low. They are really understanding and walk me though any problems I may have have\/had with lots of details and great customer service. I never have too wait long when i contact them through the customer service number. I can always understand what they are saying too me and who im speaking with on the line as oppose too speaking too foreigners constantly and not being able too understand them on the line.","278":"I love this Visa by Bank of America. It was one of the first credit cards I had, and I still use it to this day, 8 years later. Bank of America gave me a much higher limit compared to my other cards, and the 0% introductory rate is a lot longer than other credit cards; 15 months here versus 6-12 months at other banks.Even after the introductory rate is over, they still have very low rates. Just pay off your card on time! There aren't a whole lot of frills with this card, but combined with their excellent online banking and customer service, this is an excellent card.Even when my card was used fraudulently, their customer service contacted me to fix everything before I even had realized what happened! I definitely recommend this credit card.","277":"Right off the bat I like the fact that there is a $50 bonus just for signing up. Nothing beat free money. Which is completely different the US Bank card that I previously owned. While you aren't required to spend a certain amount I somehow was unable to receive the bonus points on my purchases. I like that BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature Card lays out the points perfectly and ease for members to use. Racking up points for purchases will be super easy and quick. I use my card a lot for purchases. The transfer fee for balance transfers is a bit high considering I like to do a lot of transfers within the month. I also like the fact that there is no limit to the amount of points that you are able to earn each year. So I can spend to my little heart's content","276":"When I headed off to college I had this card issued to me by the bank. It was pretty basic. I wanted something effortless -- meaning no constant small fees, no overdraft, none of the frills because I know I wasn't going to use them. It's very simple and like another reviewer said, bare boned. I could pay my bills online and not constantly have to carry cash with me. It does what it claims and it's a good stepping stone for young adults. Just remember to pay off your card on time and there won't be any issues because the rates are fairly low.","279":"The BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is great if you are a frequent traveler and actually spend your own money on travel. The way that this card shines is that they give you 1.5% back on every day purchases, and 3% on travel purchases with a cap of $6,000 worth of purchases. The downside is that you are limited towards a statement credit towards travel, not for cash back, gift cards, or other rewards that other programs offer. Other cards like Venture offer 1.25% back with no annual fee, but you can redeem for gift cards and spend the money however you want. Definitely consider this as your every day spending card if you do a lot of travel, if not then it might not be for you.","1871":"BankAmericard Cash Reward Card is awesome. There isn't anything not to like about this credit card. You get $100 dollars back after spending just $500 dollars in the first 3 months. I love the 2% on groceries and 3% on gas, with prices of both climbing everyday this can add up to big savings. Another great thing about this credit card is Bank of America has branches everywhere so if you need to get cash from an ATM you can usually find one close to you. The other thing I love about this card is you don't have to register for any of the cash back features you just automatic get them.","1870":"I really think that this card is on the VISA network, which is a major benefit as visa cards tend to be accepted in more places than others. The rates are ok, and are fairly typical of cards in this range- it really shines with the cash advance fee of only 5%, however, as many other cards charge 10% or higher. The AAA rewards card is also a great international card if you travel; the smart chip embedded in the card makes it perfect for business people or frequent travelers, and since it is a visa you know it will be accepted in most locations.","1872":"The BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature Card has no annual fee and offers a $50 bonus for signing up. Compared to the Chase Sapphire preferred card you get a lot more with this card and have to do a lot less. The Chase card requires you spend a certain amount within three months to earn your bonus. With the BankAmericard you also earn points each time you shop for gas or groceries. You'll really rack up points this way and there isn't a limit on points you can earn so you can just keep spending and earning. Other than that the interest rate and other fees seem pretty run of the mill.","1873":"The BankAmericard Cash Rewards Card from Bank of America is amazing! The initial $100 bonus for spending $500 in the first three months is super easy to reach, and the rewards tiers are pretty nice too. This was my first credit card ever, after receiving multiple rejections from other banks for not having a credit history. I spend a lot of my money on gas for traveling, so the 3% cashback on gas is great! The only drawback is that there is a quarterly limit of cashback on $1500 spent on gas and groceries. However, that's still $45 every 3 months on gas that I otherwise would not have had if it weren't for this card, so it's still pretty great. The 0% intro APR is also nice for situations where money may be tight because of transitions in life or something like that. I would definitely recommend this card whole-heartedly.","1874":"The BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card looks like a great credit card and I would like to apply for it. I use my credit cards to pay for most of my items, and I really like that I can get 1.5 points for every dollar that I spend, which is more than my current credit cards offer me. I also travel pretty frequently, as I have family members that live out of the country, so earning more points by using it on airline purchases is very beneficial to me. I also like that there are no foreign fees with this card.","1876":"This Bankamericard for Students Credit Card is fantastic! I've had it for just about a month now and it is absolutely fantastic! The only qualms I have about it are the boring rewards tiers. However, the 3% on gas is amazing. I always volunteer to pay upfront for the gas now, and my friends give me cash back. It's not much, but the cashback adds up. I also got a 100 dollar bonus from them for spending 500! It's such an easy offer to fulfill, this card is definitely worth checking out if you're just starting out. I am fairly new to the creditcard game and this is my first one ever.","1875":"This card is great for what it is largely because of Bank of America. The rate isn\u2019t too high, which is nice, and it\u2019s Visa, so it\u2019s good everywhere. You can get that elsewhere too. I have had nothing but good experiences with BofA customer service with this card, even when my number got stolen and fraudulent charges hit the account. The online banking system is great too: it\u2019s not confusing and makes it easy to do whatever you need to do. They even have a system for creating a number to use online so that your real number doesn\u2019t get stolen from online merchants. There\u2019s a lot to like here.","1877":"This is an interesting idea for a card. I was reading over it and it sounds fairly decent. I have had trouble with credit cards before, like Visa and Mastercard, but I like the rate on this one. I also like that it rewards you, I hear people speak of getting rewards from their cards for spending but I don't think they get as much as this card is offering. I would like to apply for this card, should I be approved. I don't use credit cards that often but I probably would if I could have a card like this.","1878":"I received an offer for the Bank of America BankAmericard Visa and was interested in a card with a low limit as to build some credit and not be able to run it up too high. I applied and was approved immediately. I started using the card for small purchases as the market and fast food restaurants and paid it back immediately. It really helped me learn to be more responsible with my credit and also helped build my nonexistent credit rating at the time. I would suggest this to any responsible first time credit card users and would suggest paying it back immediately every time as to avoid fees. Good little card to get you started.","930":"I first got this credit card when I started college about 2 years ago to help pay with some of the things required from my university. So far it has been a great credit card to use. I pay off the credit that I have accumulated every month and that method is very seamless. I have the bank of america app for my smartphone that allows me to transfer money from my bank account to pay for my credit card and this makes it so much easier to deal with. I can check how much credit I have used very easily and fast with the app so that I can stay on top of things. The customer service for my credit card is top notch. For instance, one time someone had gotten my credit card information which was my fault, and started making purchases with the card. Bank of America noticed the unusual amount of purchases being made with the card and called me immediately to tell me about them. With my permission, they then canceled that card so it could no longer be of uses and returned all of the sales that was being made without my permission. This whole ordeal was quickly halted and fixed by Bank of America which is why they are still my bank provider to this day.","932":"I've had my Bank of America Visa for nearly 10 years now, and it's my favorite credit card to date. Not only is the credit limit on it substantially higher than all of my other credit cards, but I was able to secure an extremely low group-based rates that blows all other cards' rates out of the water. The customer service to date has been excellent, and, as long as you are a responsible card owner and pay the majority of your bills on time, they are very forgiving when you miss the occasional due date. The rewards program is also very good, and I have redeemed my points several times for gift cards from a number of different popular retailers (e.g., J Crew, Nordstrom, etc).","931":"Woohooo this is a pretty nice credit card!! The BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature Card offers a LOT of variety in terms of rewards and that is NICE to see! I see rewards for simply spending money (which we all do) and then I see rewards for gas\/grocery aaaand drugstore, which is great. I like that they initially offer 3 points for a time before they drop to the typical 1 point. Who wouldn't want money back for spending 500 dollars and I haven't seen the rewards offered, but I hope they are pretty good. I have a discover card that I've had for years, but it doesn't give me rewards like this (I get a 1 to 1 ratio for everything and that's just boring) Be careful about the cash advance, but even the APR is pretty dang good!","1879":"I like the BankAmericard Visa Card. It was my first card I got when I was enrolled in college. They gave me a high credit limit and a low interest rate. I built my credit up over the last three years through using this card to pay my monthly phone bill. The payment method every month is very simple if you have a Bank of America Checking Account. You can simply transfer money to the credit card account to pay it off every month without a fee being charged. That's incredibly helpful and convenient if you are a student. Another plus is that their customer service is always top notch and I have always had my questions answered promptly and accurately when I inquire about billing and payments.","934":"The AAA Rewards Credit Card is a rewards card where you earn an average amount on grocery and gas purchases. You earn 3 points on qualifying travel purchases, though it doesn't specify exactly what that means, so you'll have to investigate it further if you're interested. Beyond that, it's 1 point for all other purchases, which is pretty standard - my Amazon rewards card does the same thing. The rate seems a tad lower than its competitors, though there's not much else going for the card in terms of lower rates of things like transfers, if you use that sort of thing. However, it does seem to be accepted in foreign countries, which is a perk for travelers. There's a fee, of course.","933":"This seems to be a great card. The best perks (in my opinion) are the increased cash back rewards on groceries and gas, which are necessities. Even if you're on a strict budget, you can still earn cash back this way. Also, starting out with $100 cash back is pretty great. Having a 0% intro rate for a full year is almost unheard of in the credit card world. Overall, the perks for this card are fantastic.Compared to the REI Visa, this seems to be comparable, unless you buy a ton from REI. The nice thing about the BankAmericard is that you can get higher than 2-3% back on groceries and gas, whereas the REI Visa only offers 1% back on these types of purchases.","936":"This is a fantastic credit card. I've had it for over a year. I've earned lots of rewards by putting my gas, groceries, and other weekly purchases on here. They offer double and triple rewards on gas, groceries, and restaurant purchases. Their terms are reasonable and they even offer a 10% bonus on the cash back if you have it deposited in a Bank of America account. Can't get any better than that! If you like cash back rewards to use in any way you like then this is the card for you. Charge everything and you\u2019ll be earning cash in no time.","935":"I've had this card for just over 18 months now and have had nothing but good things to say about it. Bank of America tends to get a bad wrap but I have experienced none whatsoever. About 4 months ago my credit card information was stolen. They alerted me (through phone call) almost instantly that there were fraudulent charges. They went ahead and cancelled the card and sent a new one out. All the fraudulent charges were taken care of by then and it was very minimal effort on my side. As far as rewards goes, there are better ones available but I'm perfectly fine with these. They do offer promotional bonuses from time to time which make the rewards pretty good. I use this card for all of my spending and pay it off each month. All in all, I would strongly recommend this card to others.","937":"Great card overall. The $5 cash advance fee is really good but the cash advance rate is a little crazy. The 90 day promotion is definitely worth doing. You get $50 back for just spending $500 in the first 3 months. The best thing that I'm not used to is getting points on gas, drug, and grocery purchases. My old first progress platinum card sucked compared to this. It had much higher rates, a yearly fee, and it didn't have an intro rate like this. On this card you don't have an intro rate on the first 12 months, which is crazy good. The biggest difference is the overdraft protection. I've been in spot where I didn't have it, and trust me, its worth it.","938":"The BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is a fairly decent card, it definitely is not the best card available but it is not the worst either. One thing I found interesting about it is how hard it was to get approved. The card requires pretty good credit and you would think that for how hard it is to get approved, it would be better, but nope. It's not a bad card by any means, just doesn't compare at all to other rewards cards on the market today. At least there is no unnecessary fees attached. But other than that, I would just go after another card instead, there are much better offerings on the market.","312":"The BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature Card is a good credit card. It's rewards program is pretty decent I guess, it's not that special though and probably will get replaced if you find yourself with a more popular rewards credit card. Although the points are nice on the card, there is no limit to how many you can earn every year, and you get a bonus to the amount you earn for the first 6 months, which is nice. Other than that I find that this card is just kind of lack luster and isn't worth using over some of other cards I have.","311":"The BankAmericard for Students is the card that I'm currently using. Since I'm a college student, my starting credit score isn't that amazing and I need to built it up. So I got this card for starters and it's been working out so far. Although there's no rewards, this card is perfect for bringing you into the folds of credit card payments. There's nothing special about the no rewards, which is somewhat off putting, the balance transfers and cash advances are on par with a lot of other basic student cards. But the great thing about this card is that you will get alerts on fixed payments in order to keep track of your financial situation. You also get tips from Ultimate Money Skills to help build your credit.","310":"I've had this card since 1997. I've never run into any issues. The interest rate is started low for the introduction period, and then has gone up to industry average. There is no fee for the card, which I like. The rewards program is decent. I've used it a couple of times to get cash back. I enjoy the online banking. It is very easy to use and clear. I have another card that offers better interest rates and point systems, but this card is quite good as well. I would recommend it to anyone, especially as a starter card. to build credit.","939":"The staff at Bank of America has been great to me and my wife. About a year ago we had our first son, and we needed a bit of a bump in our finances, so we took out a loan with them. There was no hassle, and they treated us so well. Where most other banks may have given us consideration only, Bank of America went that extra mile and believed in us. Since that time, we have had a checking account with them and the experience has been wonderful. The customer service I would say is some of the best in the banking business.","313":"The terms of the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Card are completely reasonable and do provide many benefits to anyone looking to earn incentives when they use their credit card. The intro rate of 0 percent is very promising and ideal as is the fact that there is no max overlimit fee. Dealing with a limit fee can be a hassle and its great that the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Card has dropped this altogether. The chance of getting $100 cash back bonus after you make $500 in purchases within 90 days of account opening should be easy for anyone to achieve so just by signing up and using it a bit, you will already reap rewards. Used smartly, it is like they are paying you to use their service. Overall a solid card and one that you should add if you are looking to build credit with some great incentives and rewards.","314":"I am super impressed with the different options available with the AAA Rewards Credit Card! In comparison with credit cards I've used in the past, the AAA Rewards Credit Card has soooo much more to offer. I love that it offers low introductory rates and think that its smart chip technology is such a wonderful idea and would make for a lot of ease of access when it's is most needed: during trips out of country! The rewards offered are such an incredible deal and I have to would say that this credit card rates at the top of my list in every regard!","316":"This card is pretty nice. I've had it for about 2 years and it was my first credit card. I usually use it for online purchases and some restaurant charges, and the interest rate is very reasonable, and my monthly bill is relatively low, at less than $20. I have the option for a credit line increase, but I've never really needed it. It does come with some rewards for things like Netflix, but I haven't used those either. I really like the grace period on this card. A smaller cash advance rate would be better, but it's a little lower than the rate on some other cards.","315":"This was the first credit card I had when I was a student and it has remained one of the best. It is completely manageable and has a low rate for a person first starting out to build their credit. My payments every month have been extremely low, around 15 or 16 dollars a month which has allowed to a lot of room for re payment as well as other living expenses. I also liked their flexible payment date which allowed me to schedule their payments according to what is best for me. The online service is also very easy to use and its basically a one click payment and you get a confirmation number. It really could not be simpler to use. A great card for those looking to build initial credit.","318":"For frequent flyers of the Spirit Airline Services, the Spirit Airline Credit Card is a must have. There's no annual fee for the first year, but there's different amounts of payments for tier levels. The Rewards are miles based, with an initial bonus of 15,000 miles and a 2 miles\/$1 for base\/max earn. You can redeem round trip rewards after 5,000 miles and no blackout dates for flight redemption. The Purchase, Balance Transfers, and Cash Advances are on par with other cards such as the SouthWest Airlines. The Paperless Statement Option and online alerts are something of a plus, but it's a guarantee option nowadays with most other cards. Comparing this to the Southwest Airlines Card, it is seriously lacking to Southwest's 50,000 bonus points options, but Southwest is points based instead of mileage based.","317":"For those with less than decent credit, or no credit at all, I think the BankAmericard Fully Secured Credit Card seems like an obvious choice. Your credit is limited for a reason, but can be extended if you demonstrate good credit habits. The $39 annual fee seems a bit steep, but I suppose that's just BankAmericard taking advantage of what they can. I think the BankAmericard is a good step in the right direction for those that really need it. It seems to create necessary restrictions and precautions while helping people establish better credit little by little. Obviously this isn't something someone with an average or above average score would need, but it's nice to know something like this is there for some that need it.","319":"I have had this card since I started banking with Bank of America. I think that the rewards are some of the best in the business. Earning extra points with gas is extremely helpful and you still earn points everywhere you shop. The interest rates are pretty standard and I do not have to pay any fee for the card. It is never worth it to have to pay for the privilege to use the card. I have used this card for a multiple things like trips and vacation and its nice to take a look at the rewards after you have made some larger purchases. I usually use the rewards to buy gift cards for my friends and family for Christmas and Birthdays. Overall a pretty good card.","960":"As a student with barely any credit history, it was very difficult to find a credit card that I could qualify for. Thankfully, I managed to find the BankAmericard. Being somewhat irresponsible at times, it would be easy for me to forget to check when a bill is due, but this card has a fixed due date which is very helpful. Also, considering I know little about how to build and maintain a good credit history, the Ultimate Money Skills is a very helpful feature to give me tips on how to be a responsible credit card owner. The late fee is quite steep, but I never plan on being late in the first place.","962":"Spirit has slowly become my favorite air line based on the fact that the prices they offer cant be beat by anyone and now that I have theSpirit Airlines Credit Card things have gotten even better. Not only do you earn miles with this amazing card every time you spend a dollar but you are given 15,000 points just for signing up. Another major plus to this card is by having it you are entered in Spirits 9 dollar club which lets you travel on select flights for 9 dollars plus a baggage fee. That cant be beat by any other airline.","961":"Get BankAmerica Visa Fully Secured Credit card if you need to establish yourself in the credit world or get yourself out of the hole. Basically you provide a security deposit and if you do well over 12 months, you get it back. The only downside is you have a $39 fee per year, but when your building your credit it really outweighs that negative speck. After a year you can get increases based on your annual report of how much you pay and use the card. Once you establish some credit with this card you can then branch out to better cards or upgrade into a rewards card or a card of your choice.","3502":"Don't Trust The Refinance Dept !!! \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I call to find out information about paying my mortage off early. \u00a0 \u00a0The transfered me to refianance.

Sherri \u00a0","963":"I am now 18 and can apply for a credit card. Comparing Capital One with the San Francisco Giants cards, I think that they are equal on having no annual fee and 0% interest, for one year. The San Francisco Giants card does allow foreign transactions, but the Capital One card does not. If someone wants to travel, the Giants Card might be the way to go instead, even though there is a 3% fee.I like that Capital One gives cash back instead of points. I prefer the $ 100 bonus instead of 100,000 points. Cash is King.For the % rates, I see that the Giants card is higher than the Capital One card. I do not like being nickeled and dimed-ever. In favor of the Giants card, if one likes points, they can earn unlimited points, whereas there is a maximum of 1.5% cashback on the Capital One card. I have never used points. But say I spent 100 for the month. That means I would get back $ 1.50. I am floored. That does not seem at all worth it. But, then again, I do not know how points would outdo this incredible cashback bonus.And the choosing point for me is that you can find out online with the Giants card, but with Capital One. To me, that means customer service is better. I would have to go with the Giants.","965":"Honestly, who doesn't like Star Wars? The Star Wars Credit Card is a great themed credit card, especially if you're a huge Star Wars buff. However, the reward rate isn't as good as other cards that may fall into the same category. The intro rates, which are 0% for the card, are pretty good and I actually like that a lot, and both intro rates are for 10 months or so, which is a plus. I think the card is pretty cool, but when compared to my TrueEarnings from Costco and American Express, it becomes apparent that my card is better - with a better cash back reward system, and a better interest rate for most people, I'd go with my trusty TrueEarnings each time.","964":"The AAA Rewards Credit Card is a great card for those who travel a lot. The rates are relatively low, starting at 12.99% and it offers a very good rewards program. By earning triple points on qualifying AAA travel purchases, it could be very lucrative as far as rewards go. I work in the hotel business and I have a lot of guests who use this exact card upon check-in and their reason is usually the same: they use it for the rewards. With this card, what you see is what you get. There aren't many special features that other cards offer but plainly put it's just a relatively good card for every day use and a very good card for travel use.","967":"Spirit Airlines' card is definitely useful for those who fly quite often and would encourage me to use their airline if I had the card. It does come with a high interest rate at 16-19%, and the transfer rate for balances is 4%. However, the benefits you reap when you fly is extremely useful. The card gives two miles per dollar spent which is an unbelievable deal for using a credit card you already planned to use. The 15,000 bonus miles with the first major purchase is also phenomenal, as that's enough for a few business trips, and every $1,000 spent results in another 2,000 miles. For anyone who needs to fly, this card is a perfect fit!","968":"I think the NEA Credit Card is a nice option for people that like good cash back bonuses. This card definitely has that. It is also what I like about the card. You get zero percent for a year. I also like that you can get a 200 buck bonus after spending 500 bucks during your first 90 days after opening your account. This is quite similar to the AARP rewards card, except you only get 100 bucks after spending 500 bucks during your first 3 months, so the NEA Credit Card is a bit better. Also considering that you do not have to be a certain age to get it. I love that there is no annual fee. There is nothing I can say I dislike about this card. It is a really good card with good benefits.","966":"I think the BankAmericard Visa Secured Credit Card is a really good card to have if you have bad credit. I like that they accept people with limited credit and bad credit. It gives these people a chance to establish a credit history. This card is very similar to my first secured card, except it is a bit better. I have had a capital one secured credit card. I like this one better because you can get a credit line up to $4900. With the Capital One one, you can get it up to 3000 bucks. Now with that said, I do dislike the min. deposit on the BankAmericard. It is a bit high compared to the secured card at capital one.","1371":"Since I rarely travel and when I do it is by car and not flying, the BankAmericard Privileges with Travel Rewards Credit Card doesn't seem to have any benefits that would turn me onto wanting to apply for it since I would not benefit from the rewards. Even still, the APR and the rewards seem good for someone who did travel and the first year being free and the bonus points you get for rewards seems nice. However the annual fee after the first year seems a little high especially since the card is only being offered to people with excellent credit. Also the fact that the card is through Bank of America lowers my trust for how well customer service actually is and if they would stick to late fee charges and any other charges on the card. Overall I think this card just doesn't seem like a good option when there are plenty of other cards available out there to someone who is looking in the excellent credit area.","3504":"Bank Of America Home Loans We recently refinanced with Bank of America and I wished we hadn't stayed with them. Multiple delays due to their inaccurate and sloppy review of loan documents with multiple requests for documents already received. It's like we were working for them vs. true customer service. Our mortgage officer was great, but the underwriting department was the pitts. Unfortunately their customer service is a hassle now too. It's really unfortunate that they make every interaction so hard for their customers. I will not use their business again if we move or choose to refinance again.","969":"If you are an individual who travels through Asiana Airlines often, this credit card is really great bonus with awesome perks. I'm really looking forward to using my card when I travel through Asiana since with every three miles, I get $1 back to spend! The 10,000 bonus miles added to your account after the first purchase is also a cool perk. Also, the $100 rebate every year for Asiana Airlines tickets is really great especially for traveling in the holidays. The Asiana Airlines American Express Credit Card is a great option for those who travel often with Asiana Airlines!","1370":"The Amway Credit Card has a nice reward system if you are a frequent consumer of Amway products, based on percentages instead of the typical \"point per dollar\" systems utilized by most reward cards. The 12 months of 0% interest rates on purchases is nice in comparison to other rewards cards which rarely offer this. However, those with excellent credit may want to avoid this card as it does not offer a very low bottom end on interest rates. However, even those with flawless credit may want to consider this card if they frequent Amway. Overall, this is a decnet rewards card, but nothing spectacular in any way.","1372":"I like that the intro period offered through this card is one year. I like that there are no overlimit charges and the interest rates seem to be in line with credit cards I have used in the past (mainly the Reward zone program Mastercard). I don't usually use reward programs, but I like that this card offers rewards if I choose to use them. I absolutely love that you can choose what team you want on your card and that the card offers online services. Online services are SO helpful!!I do not like that the card requires you to have \"excellent or good\" credit rating; although, my credit rating would fall into that category, I have limited credit history and I think it would be hard for me to get this card. That is one problem I never had with my previous cards ( The rewardzone and also my Wal-mart Mastercard), they were all low balance and not hard on \"low or no credit\" applicants. I had no trouble being accepted.","1373":"The BankAmericard Visa Fully Secured Credit Card is a decent enough option for those with limited credit histories or with bad credit, pretty typical for the type. However, you can get this one up to a $4900 limit if you can secure it beforehand. This seems different than the secured card I first got when I was looking to build my history. The annual fee and the interest rates are pretty typical for the type of card it is. With no monthly fee or any one-time fees, the BankAmericard Secured Credit Card is still a solid option for those in which it was intended.","1374":"The Spirit Airlines Credit Card is (obviously) a flight rewards card, and that's all it really has to offer, but it does it well. For example, its 4% fee on balance transfers is a bit higher than normal, and the minimum regular interest rate of over 16% is a bit hefty, even for a rewards card. However, if you are looking to fly a lot and use this card to pay for it, you will get what you are looking for out of the Spirit Airlines Credit Card. This card has annual bonuses, not just one-time for people who use it a lot, and also double rates on points, you get two miles per dollar. There are no limits on your miles, and you don't even need perfect credit to obtain this frequent flyer card. Also, this card is for the long term with no intro rates on balance transfers...I'll take my barebones Oklahoma State Alumni Card for the most part.","1375":"I like the NEA American express card because of the really nice cash back bonuses. Zero percent for a year is awesome also. I did not think I would qualify but decided to try anyway, to my surprise i was approved. I have wanted a cash back card for a long time and now I finally have one. I use a lot of gas so saving three percent on all of my gas is a huge deal. Getting a 200 dollar bonus after spending 500 is really cool because everyone loves free money. This card will be my go to credit card from now on.","1376":"The Star Wars Credit Card seems like a decent option at first, but with good credit there may be better options out there. The intro rates for purchases and balance transfers is nice, but the duration is lower than some other options out there (alumni cards are good about this). Also, the 4% fee on balance transfers is a little bit high when compared to other cards that are intended for the same \"audience\", and much higher than the 0% fee on my Slate by Chase card. The reward system is a little bit lacking as well, with just a max earn of one point per dollar, some other cards give up to 3 points max return when used on some specific items. Overall, not a terrible card, but not flawless either.","1377":"I personally own and love this card. It's so easy to earn points and you start with 3% for the first year. Compared to other cards like visa signature where the interest rate is beyond reasonable. This is my first credit card and I couldn't love it more. There are tons of rewards such as cash back, AAA vouchers, or gift cards. Not to mention you could double points on grocery items. The AAA rewards credit card is a great card.","1378":"I'm not much of flyer myself, so the mediocre interest rates and lack of any sort of introductory rates in lieu of a traveler's reward program really turned me off to the BankAmericard Privileges\u00ae with Travel Rewards Credit Card pretty quickly. If you're a frequent flyer, then the program probably makes this a decent option. The other thing that made me cringe a little bit is the fact that there is an annual fee unless you overuse the card, after the first year at least. There's quite a few little perks that wealthy travelers will probably enjoy taking advantage of, but overall this seems a rather mediocre card for most people.","1379":"As far as company credit cards go, the Amway Global Credit Card is a fairly good deal. Compared to other companies, Amway\u2019s card offer a relatively fair rewards program and a great introductory interest rate offer. Even after zero interest for a year, the regular rate for the card only increases to a base of 12.99%. This card could really be worth it (especially for the first year) if you use Amway a lot. Even if you don\u2019t the zero interest for the first year could be very useful to you! The credit restrictions are not high on this one, so apply if you can!","730":"I travel a lot for work so the Bank of America World MasterCard credit card with WorldPoints rewards and PayPass comes in really handy. Some of the features are very useful. Automatic auto rental insurance and Trip Assurance with Trip Delay\/Cancellation Insurance help set my mind at ease on long business trips. I've heard about other cards like the CapitalOne VentureOne rewards card but from what I've read it doesn't offer nearly as much as this card. I almost forgot about one of the best features for travelers; Total Security Protection. Credit Card Security is of utmost importance when you travel as much as I do.","731":"The Asiana Airlines American Express Credit Card is a great way to earn air miles while making all of your purchases. Earning two miles per dollar on gas and groceries, three miles per dollar when flying, and one mile for per dollar for every other purchase are great rates! Plus, its hard to beat 10,000 bonus miles just for making a single purchase. The automatic rebate is awesome, and I am looking forward to my lounge invitations. The paperless billing and smartchip technology mean they are using the latest technology available, and a $0 liability guarantee against fraudulent transactions takes the worry out of making online purchases.","735":"I think the Temple University Alumni Association Credit Card is a fairly decent card. It has competitive cash-back bonuses as well as 10% extra savings if you deposit your money into a Bank of America checking or savings account. That's a huge plus for those who bank with Bank of America. I think the rate % is a little high on each end of the spectrum - low and high side. Compared to my Capital One Visa I would not recommend the Temple University Alumni Association Credit Card to anyone that I know. My rating is 2 stars. It's not completely terrible but I don't think it's average, either.","738":"The Montana State University Alumni Credit Card really stands out with its 12 month introductory rate on purchases. Most credit cards I have come across only off 6 months, if any at all. Also, the fact that this Alumni card carries no annual fees is really nice too. Also, I've never before had a rewards card of any type, that's a nice little bonus that I'm not used to. Also, the fraud protection offered by the Montana State University Alumni Credit Card is some of the best around. Overall I really like this card and would recommend it to all people who graduated from Montana State.","739":"The Brown University Alumni Credit Card is a pretty good card if you have the credit to get approved. The 1% back on purchases, 2% back on groceries and 3% back on gas is a huge bonus. This card is great for buying gas and groceries, then paying off the majority of the balance at the end of the month. The introductory rate of 0% is also a huge bonus. Linking it to a Bank of America is also fantastic. I\u2019ve never seen a card that does that and it gives you the 10% customer bonus. The balance transfer fee is very low and can help pay off those other credit cards with less desirable rates. All in all, this card is a very nice offer.","80":"The Arizona Diamondbacks Credit Card is great in that it has no annual fee, has the common introductory period of 12 months of no interest and allows you to earn points (1 per dollar spent) as part of their rewards program.Unlike most other credit cards, though, there is no zero interest introductory rate on balance transfers so if that is something you would like to use, that is not a perk for you, but is something you can easily find offered from other companies. I do not like that about this card.Despite the rewards points and no annual fee, I think a better credit card is the Chase Freedom Visa because it has no annual fee, and 15 months no interest on both balance transfers and purchases. You also earn up to 5% cash back on purchases, and get a $100 bonus if you spend $500 within the first three months. It requires excellent credit, like the Arizona Diamondbacks Credit Card so I think if you have to be qualified to even apply for the card, you should at least get the best perks available to you.","737":"You gotta love the fact that there is a full year of no interest. I mean, most of my cards have only been 6 months, but you do need at least good credit to get the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma Alumni Credit Card, so I guess you should expect some more perks. Also, having the ability to earn reward points with every dollar I spend is pretty nice too. It's pretty common, but not having any annual fee, and having the type of fraud protections that this card offers is a comforting thing. Not only do I know that I won't have to worry about my identity\/account being compromised, I can just hold on to the card and not have to have random charges pop up out of nowhere. This is a solid card for all OU alumi.","736":"The NYU University Alumni American Express card is a pretty standard prime card. The interest rate at 12.99-22.99% is average for this type of card, but one thing that I really love is the intro rate. 0% interest for 12 months is a great deal. I\u2019ve had other cards in the past that had an intro rate, but never 12 months long. The rewards are good, but not as good as cash back. I prefer my Bank of America cash back card rewards over NYU University Alumni American Express point rewards which really limit what you can do with your reward. Overall, I think this is a good credit card and will consider applying for one, but if you\u2019re looking for a rewards card specifically, you should consider other options.","733":"What I like about the Case Western Reserve University Alumni Credit Card is that you get points that you can use to get rewards. This card looks good also because it has no annual fee and the max late fee is only 35$. This card is also for students that are some of the brightest in the nation, so this card would be really goof for students it won't cost them much. One of the only things I don't like about this card is that you need excellent credit to get. I have a Best Buy credit card and it has almost the same terms as this one except I can only use my card in Best Buy stores , so this card is way more better","732":"The Case Western Reserve University Alumni Credit Card is a great offering thanks to its great (0%) introductory interest rate for several months, and very reasonable regular rate after that. Compared to my old U.S. Bank credit card, this card is perfect for my needs due to the rewards it offers (it can be applied to merchandise, and discounts on services) that my previous card did not offer. All of my previous cards required an annual fee, and it is a nice surprise to see this one doesn't. In other words, I think this card offers very good features, although I wished the intro period was longer (at least 15 months), otherwise this is a solid credit card that is ideal for people like me who want more perks when using my card.","734":"The University of Deleware Alumni Credit Card has good cash back rewards with up to 3% cash back on gas, 2% on groceries and 1% on other purchases. However, compared to the card I personally use, the Capital One Quicksilver Visa Car, this card has very bad interest rates that accumulate over time. I do like the fraud liability protection, though, as that can definitely come in handy in this day and age. I would recommend this card to friends and family as it's not incredibly bad, but it's not that great either. 3 Stars is a fair rating for this card because it's a very average card. It may help if you're good at keeping your credit in line, though.","3505":"Can't Provide Docs In A Crisis We're trying to close on a home, and my wife and I each needed to provide a transfer record from our banks. I called my credit union, \"Logix,\" and they emailed me what I needed immediately. My wife called Bank of America, and although the representative admitted she could see the transaction on her screen, she could not email, or fax record of it to us. Only snail mail would be provided. We needed it by the end of the day so that the lender would be appeased and we could close by the end of the week. The rep actually understood and apologized for their \"policy,\" but suggested that if we go in to a branch, Bank of America corporate could email or fax the transaction to a representative of the branch... but not to the actual customer. Makes NO SENSE. But, we took her advice and hoped for the best. We went to the branch and were again denied. The branch representative also was very apologetic for their \"policy.\" I have an idea... CHANGE THE POLICY! My advice to everyone: do NOT choose your bank based on the number of ATM options.","3506":"Bad Rep Unjustified For Me, 20 Years Provided about $500 in various bonuses despite my bad credit. Electronic bill pay in checking \u00a0is superb, no difficulties, fast to reach payees even without bank accounts. Accommodating even in branches when I forgot debit card. East and West Coast accounts worked well; except\u00a0some branches have L-o-n-g waits for which a star is subtracted.","81":"Bank of America wasn't a very good financial institution for me. At one point my account went under $2 and I had not noticed, they proceeded to hit me with a $35 fee for every day it was negative and I didn't have any alerts on, by the time I saw this I was negative over $200 and had to close out my account and pay it off. I really liked them for a long time, but that was too much for me. I did like their \u201cKeep the Change\u201d program, and how you could deposit cash directly into the ATM\u2019s, that was very convenient.","82":"The best credit card available for me is the BankAmericard for Students! As a college student with a very limited credit history it is somewhat hard for me to buy the things I need on credit. This card gives me the flexibility I need, while also allowing for my limited experience with credit cards and establishing credit. I highly recommend the BankAmericard for Students!","83":"I have been banking with Bank of America for several years now. Overall, I would say I have had a good experience with this bank. Over the years though I have definitely considered closing my account for good because of some of the new policies that have been in place such as the fee for doing transactions with a teller inside the bank. To avoid this you have to go outside and only use the ATM which is really an inconvenience. Because of this I only use online banking now which I'm sure a lot of people probably do now as well and have opted to use another bank as well for the transactions I want to make inside the bank. Bank of America is still a good bank to me but there are other institutions that are offering better services.","3507":"Offspring Of The Creature From Jekyll Island They put a hold on a check, then someone in the risk dept. would overturn it...not once, but twice.\u00a0 If you get an answer to a question from customer service, you cannot count on it being true.\u00a0 Personell in local banks try to be helpful, but always they are largely minimum wage tellers and clerks who have no decision authority.\u00a0 They don't have the authority to buy paper clips or toilet paper for restrooms, much less overcome arbitrary decisions made by the impersonal fools behind the 800 number (800-BUSINESS).\u00a0 BOA is hereby fired.\u00a0 Their so called 'services' are no longer acceptable.","600":"I have been a Bank of America customer for about 7 years now. I've never really had any problem with them, but I'm also very cognizant of keeping my account monitored. I have checking, savings, a car loan, and a credit card. The only fee I've ever gotten was a monthly account fee and a replacement debit card fee, but both were reversed because of good customer service and understanding.I would recommend Bank of America. But I think it's important to note that you need to keep on top of your account (as you should at any bank). Most of the CSRs know what they're doing and are willing to help you.I also had a good experience refinancing my car a few years ago. I had to put a lot down on it (because it was worth less than my loan), but I have a good APR. Online banking is also easy and the online bill pay is a HUGE help.","2118":"I had a checking account with BOA in college, and one day they coerced me into signing up for this card about five years ago. The interest rate was pretty decent compared to the other cards that I'd opened up, and it had a moderate limit, so I was pleased. I put some class fees on the card, paid them off, and suddenly BAM! The card limit was quadrupled. It was a pretty steep change, but I don't mind having the extra credit in times of need, so that was pretty cool. I'm aware that if I miss a payment on this card the interest will shoot up pretty badly, so I'm always pretty careful with it, and things stay alright. All in all, it's a solid back-up card, and if you're young and have fairly good credit, they aren't going to automatically stick you with a ridiculously high interest rate like other cards.","2110":"Banks exist to hold our money when we have too much, and Bank of America certainly does this competently. I haven't any issues with money disappearing, except that one time someone got my routing number and tried to steal a few thousand dollars. BoA was more than happy to let this stranger liquidate my life savings without any concern whatsoever over the obvious clues that this was an illegal transaction (something I was hoping an institution with experience handling money would be able to realize before a college student with no experience). In order to convince BoA that I was in fact the owner of my own account and did not change my name to transfer all my funds to a bank that didn't exist, I had to do everything short of a DNA test to prove my identity. Strange that they didn't ask for this before the enormous leakage of funds, but whatever. Apart from providing me with one of the worst money-related experiences of my life, Bank of America has been a bank and has had at least one location in America. If you appreciate companies that have accurate titles and don't mind giving mad dosh to strangers, Bank of America is your best choice.","2111":"When it comes to banking and saving money, I would not recommend Bank of America. This bank not only charges fees for everything, and I mean EVERYTHING. They charge an ATM fee for even using their ATM at their branch. The customer service is horrible and they do not treat you like a customer when it comes to finding a better solution. Now I never overdraft my account, however with all the fees that they take out every month for maintenance etc.. I felt that I was overdrawing every month. My recommendation, go with a credit union, they are friendly treat you like a customer and most importantly no fees.","2112":"I was first introduced to Bank of America by my father--who has been a loyal customer for five years--and his banker. They were trying to convince me that my first bank account should be set up under my father--giving him complete access to my money--and that I should start making weekly deposits.After the initial setup process I experienced some of the blandest customer support & was forced to go into the bank for consultation. Little did I know that was going to cost me a twenty dollar fee and my problems went unresolved until I switched to Chase. I did, however, start making weekly savings deposits.","2113":"I've been banking with BoA for the past 8 years of my life. When I first got it around 12 years old, it was to be used as a savings account (and it was for awhile) but a few years later I moved my savings from BoA to a credit union. Currently, my BoA is used solely for checking \/ credit card related transactions.Anyway, my overall experience with BoA over the years has been pretty okay. I remember when they had the $35 fee that was applied to each transaction that you made when you went over your checking balance which quickly put me into debt for awhile (for a 15-16 year old with no job, it was pretty tough recovering from this) and I resented the institution for a year or two. Ever since the policy was revoked however, my experience has been pretty good. Their customer support was helpful when I needed help making a foreign transaction with a credit card.","2114":"I have had a Bank of America account for about 3 years. I decided to open an account there because I have a few family members that are also customers of BoA, and they had positive things to say about it.I have an online eBanking account, since that is really all I need. Paying bills and making transfers is a breeze. I like being able to easily log in and check my account, whether it is from my laptop or my phone. There is even a BoA app that lets you scan your check to deposit it, instead of having to make a trip to the bank. It actually worked, so I can say that I was pleasantly surprised by that.I've yet to run into any problems with Bank of America, and would recommend this bank to other people.","2115":"I have had a BOA checking and savings account for a year now and have been very happy. At each branch there are helpful, friendly people. My local branch is especially well staffed. I feel that they are doing their jobs in keeping my account safe and secure, and I they have been very helpful any time I needed anything. The ATM locations are great, I almost never have to worry about those dumb fees when I need cash. They also have lots of ways to circumvent account maintenance fees, which is always a good thing.My only issue with this bank is that they offer me credit cards constantly. It's not forceful, just annoying to be asked every time I talk to a personal banker and get offers in the mail every few weeks. Once I opt out I'm sure there will be nothing for me to complain about.","2116":"I had a very positive experience recently when dealing with Bank of America. I was notified by email that my bank card had suspicious activity and my card had been cancelled. I immediately went to the bank, and was very thankful to know that none of the fraudulent charges had been processed. I was immediately given the option of ordering another bank card, which I did receive in 3 days. I was very impressed with customer service in the professional manner in which they handled this situation.","2119":"I have had a Bank of America bank account since I was 17. It was the clear choice at the time, which was about 7 years ago, for my banking needs. They provided a free checking account and free savings account because I was going to school. After school it still remained a free account until one day suddenly it just magically changed to a different type of account with no notice. I was charged fees without any warning and threw off my account balance from what I was expecting. It was a big problem for me to just have money come out of my account with no notice. Thankfully I called their support number and spoke with someone and they sorted out all of the problems, and even got rid of the charges. I haven't had any other problems than that with Bank Of America since I banked with them. They are a great choice for banking with their easy to use online website, multiple locations, and even apps for your cell phone. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a new bank.","2117":"I have been fairly happy with my Bank of America checking account. I actually have three accounts with them. Other than the checking account, I have a savings account and an American Express credit card. What is really nice is that all three of these accounts are all linked together on the website. After logging in, I can transfer money from checking to the credit card to pay off the balance. When I need more funds in my checking account, I can transfer money from savings. One thing you have to be careful with is that you can only transfer money from savings to checking 3 times a month or you will receive a penalty. I believe this is a federal regulation to help prevent people from using savings accounts like checking accounts.","84":"Got this card at college about half a year ago. Figured it would be handy for an emergency card, and turns out it was. Used the cash advance for rent, the credit to pay for a missed flight. The introductory 0% interest kept things from getting out of hand, and let me get things in order before starting to pay it back. The online payment options are pretty effective, too. You can set up one-time or recurring bill payment through a BoA account, and check the balance whenever, though I'm sure that's not uncommon.Word of note: Don't miss payments. Just don't.","88":"I have had a checking account with Bank of America for 5 years now, and, despite some of the bad press that this bank receives in regard to customer service, I've never experienced poor customer service. My only complaint would be that when you call Customer Support with an issue you need to resolve, it can take a long time to reach an actual person. I went abroad once while studying in college, and my bank decided to freeze my account due to suspicious activity. Though annoying, the action was understandable. It took me over an hour to get a real person on the phone, but once my call finally went through, they were able to resolve the problem quickly.","85":"I've been using Bank of America along with my other usual credit union for about 8 months now. I opened a checking account with them, and I have been extremely pleased thus far! They have a lot of account options, and they even offer a free student checking account with no minimum balance. Unfortunately for me, you need to have your student ID card with you, and I've only got an ID number, so I had to open a regular checking account. B of A has been around for awhile now, and they are very aware of the fact. They like to keep their reputation in good standing, and because of this, their customer service department is top notch. They are very polite, and more than happy to help with any account issues. I've only had to call twice, and only for questions regarding my ability to use their online banking, but both times they have been very helpful! I'd recommend them to students for sure.","86":"Bank of America is the only bank I have ever used, and for good reason! For starters, they maintain many ATM's in convenient locations, unlike some other banks in the area where one may only go to the local branch to withdraw funds. They are also very helpful and understand we make mistakes. I am currently a college student and have mistakenly overdrawn my account on a few occasions. The bank's customer service waived the overdraft fees since my family maintains good credit. Another aspect I appreciate is the user-friendly online\/mobile banking features, which allow for account maintenance through multiple convenient outlets.","89":"I've been a Bank of America customer for well over 12 years, after I had issues with my Wells Fargo account I had switched to them. I've never actually had any issues with Bank of America, for instance, about six years ago my PayPal account which was connected to my Bank of America account was compromised and drained every little bit of money I had in my checking account. I contacted Bank of America by phone told them what was going on (this was after I had contacted Paypal.) Bank of America did a quick chargeback and gave me my funds back within the day, and they had asked me to come into one of the branches to get a temporary debit card and new checks, as they feel that though PayPal's systems are secure they want to make sure all of my banking info is secure, so to be positive they were going to open a new checking account.Because of that, I will always be a Bank of America customer.","87":"Though Bank of America tends to get bad press, I don't believe that I would ever change banks. I have had a savings\/checking account with them since I was 16 years old (now 31) and have never had a problem with them. Like most banks, the fees could be crazy (monthly fee if you don't direct deposit so much per month or use their credit card once a month, etc), but all in all a reliable bank. I tend to lose my debit card on a regular basis and for $5, I have new one in no time! They even set you up with a temporary card if you go to one of their branches. I would highly recommend them to anyone.","111":"I have been using this BankAmericard for more than 5 years. Since 5 Years I have not got any issues or problems. If I make any continuous transaction, the bank authorities are cardial to call me and confirm on the transactions which I made. They are very specific in asking about the order of the transactions. I like this feature very much. For any credit card the service should be good and consistent. I always use it for specific purposes and the billing cycle is very perfectly mailed to my email enabling me to pay through online easily and effectively.","609":"We have a Bank of America checking account and credit card, American Express. On the BoA the web site, these two accounts are linked together. If I need to pay off the credit card, I can easily transfer money from my checking to the credit card account and it is paid off. Over the holidays, I was expecting a check in the mail from Maine and it was delayed several days because a bad snow storm. I had overdrafted because of this and got an overdraft penalty. After explaining the situation to customer service, they undid the penalty without giving any grief. I was very happy about this.","608":"Bank of America became my bank of choice a few years ago when I needed a national bank with branches all over. Me and my wife did the application online, which was pretty easy and straightforward. Although some questions seemed a bit personal. Once it was approved, things were super easy, we received our debit cards and started using them. I love their ATMs and being able to deposit cash and checks with hardly any effort, especially now that I can deposit checks via the mobile app as well. I have very few problems with them, but the time my card number was used in Greece and I had to call them to get it straightened out, they were fast and efficient in solving the problem and getting my money back. Overall, they've been an awesome bank.","607":"Bank of America has been pretty good to me so far. I have been with them for about three months now and have not regretted switching over to them when I had moved to a new city and this was their only banking option. Their customer service has been really on par with any of my previous banks, which to me is a really good thing. Their services for checking and savings are about the same as well with the exception to a rewards program that is pretty nifty to have if you like to shop a lot. It seems like they have ATM's everywhere, as I haven't managed to NOT find myself an ATM of theirs when I needed it, so that's a plus for this. They have a great mobile phone APP that allows me to deposit checks straight from home. Overall Bank of America has been really great so far, and I hope it stays this way. I recommend joining them if you need a bank that has ATMs all over the place or want to try something new with their rewards program.","606":"We refinanced several years back. BOA was very easy to work with, the necessary paperwork and application forms were straightforward and easy to fill out. The application writer was good to work with and she kept us informed of the entire process throughout and until closing. The appraisal went well and BOA was able to find us a local appraiser quickly. Everyone involved was punctual and followed through on all their promises. On the several occasions we've had to contact BOA Mortgage Department, they have been very helpful and answered all of our questions satisfactorily. BOA even went as far as reviewing our mortgage and finding us a way to save quite a nice sum of money every month. I would recommend them to friends and family.","110":"I was forced to switch banks whenever my wife and I relocated for work. We moved states and the bank that we had been with for years wasn't offered in our new state, so we switched to the closest bank to our house, which was Bank of America.I didn't expect anything special here because I was just switching because it was convenient. I was glad to realize that this was a great place to bank. The customer service in the lobby is always top notch. I always feel like they are truly enjoying working there and that makes my banking experience that much better.I just have a basic checking and savings account, but I'm glad to say that there hasn't been any issues with either of them since switching to them a few years ago.","605":"I have had this card for 11 years now and have had some good and some bad experiences. Overall I would recommend the card though. It has no annual fees, but my card does have a fairly high APR. The issue I've had has been with Bank of America, though I'm not sure if that's who issues all the Norweigan cards or not. They have raised my rate a few times over the years for reasons I really don't understand. I had never been late. When that happened I called to try and get them to lower it but they would not, and did not really have very good customer service. If the card were issued by another bank I would definitely recommend it however as the card does have very good rewards. You can redeem the points for onboard credits, making a reservation or other things through the cruise line. However you can also redeem them for things like gift cards and merchandise., which is great!","604":"During my time banking with Bank of America, I have personally found their practices to be annoying at best. There have been many times wherein I've had my account frozen because their fraud detection flagged a regular normal purchase. I was on the phone for about 3 hours explaining that, NO, no-one had stolen my information or stolen my cards. The end result was that I had to wait 3 weeks to get a new card even though there was no fraud and had to pay a fee to correct a problem that never existed. I cannot in good conscience recommend this bank to anyone.The fees, charges, and limitations placed on accounts will leave you scratching your head many, many times.The positive side is that the bank is very well known, reputable, and secure, as long as you are willing to put up with the minor annoyances, you shouldn't have too many problems banking with them.","603":"I had a checking account with Bank of America for a good while, and for a couple of years everything seemed to be alright. When I began, I started with the usual; checking and savings account. The one major problem with both of those; the fees. Here\u2019s an example of what I mean. On occasion I would make transfers from my savings to my checking in case I needed the money for whatever might pop up. There was one occasion where I knew I had to transfer over a larger sum, and I did. I had a number of bills to pay and some automatic payments set up. I thought everything would be fine. Towards the end of the month I ended up with several fees charged, including a 70 dollar fee for going over the transfer limit no one told me about. Here\u2019s another; I did some work for a friend and was paid by check. My fiance at the time messed up and we had to put a stop payment on it, which was also messed up. So not only did I have a fee for that, I had an overdraft fee because the fee they charged put me in the negative. So my fiance wired some money from her account to try and fix it and got hit with another fee for the wire transfer that no one told me about when I made the account. Their fees, are not only a major source of aggravation, but are annoying to deal with as well. I won\u2019t even get started on the customer service I received. Bank of America is a decent bank for most people. But my experience has turned me back around to credit unions for good.","601":"I opened an account with Bank of America in 2005. For the first couple of years, I LOVED Bank of America. Then, I started having trouble. I was charged fees for no reason. Twice they charged me overdraft fees when I had not been overdrawn. I called customer service and they were very rude to me. I had never had an experience like that with ANY company before. Once, I did get them to take the fee off but the other time they wouldn't even listen to me. Soon after the second time I canceled my account. I refuse to do business with a company that I don't feel I can fully trust.Overall, I could not recommend Bank of America. I only had a few problems in the 5 years I used Bank of America but it was enough to convince me that it's not the bank for me. The customer service is seriously lacking. I will never do business with this company again.","602":"I would give Bank of America 3.5 stars if possible. They are a solid bank with a strong customer service department and lots of locations around the nation. This is very useful for me because I travel on the road a lot and never have to go that far to find an ATM. The problems that I have with Bank of America is that they do not seem to stay open very late or on the weekends in most locations. Sometimes I wish they had better rewards as well. But other than that it is a great bank to do business with. I would recommend them to my friends and family, and most of family does already use Bank of America.","112":"A banker on the phone at BA told me to use their credit card, which has the highest APR of any I carry, \u201cin order to get a better rate.\u201d I recently noticed they were high in comparison, and called to see about getting a better APR. They told me I was wonderful, and a candidate for a reduction, and, to their credit, they did drop some. But they didn't come near my other APRs.They said they couldn't because I was paying down my balance and not charging anything. I told them I was charging, but on cards with lower rates. They said if I began charging on their card--at the higher rate\u2014\u201cmaybe\u201d something could be done at some unspecified future date.What kind of financial advice is \u201cUse the card with the highest APR?\u201d Bankers don't know marketing. You want more people charging? Put out a competitive rate and people will use it. It doesn't work the other way 'round, BA! So I'm in the market for a balance transfer deal. These guys need to be \u201cslammed\u201d and then they won't get any interest at all.","115":"The main reason I went with Bank of America was because there were so many convenient locations, I couldn't avoid going past a Bank of America branch if I tried. But what eventually made me leave was how I felt they nickel and dimed you for everything in fees. I am a strong believer that a bank should be paying you to hold onto your money, you shouldn't be paying them for anything. Bank of America seems to disagree. $14 monthly maintenance fee if you don't have a minimum daily balance above $2000. $8.95 eBanking monthly maintenance fee if you decide to have a paper statement or cash a check in a branch. $12 monthly checking fee if you don't use direct deposit. You need to really be aware of all the fees associated with this bank before signing up.","114":"I got this card a couple of years ago. I was looking for a credit card with better rewards and my sister had good experiences with Bank of America. My credit was pretty good and the sign up offers, rewards, and rates were definitely the best. I'm the kind of person that puts almost everything on a credit card and then pays it all off at the end of the month, so I really wanted to take full advantage of the rewards. I get rewards for every purchase, but get 2% on groceries and 3% on gas. It definitely adds up! I had one questionable charge and it got taken care of very quickly. Excellent customer service with Bank of America!","113":"I have been a client of Bank of America since 2001. It was the first bank I ever opened an account with. 12 years later, I have one checking account, one savings account and two credit cards with them. I also had a couple of CDs with them, which materialized fairly nicely. Their current investment rates aren\u2019t the most desirable out there, but it\u2019s probably caused by today\u2019s economy. I have never had any problems with Bank of America. Their customer service has always been very professional and accommodating. They even waived my late payment fee once, when I forgot to pay my credit card bill on time.","817":"I've had a Bank of America checking account for years now, and it is very convenient for me and has been a nice place to take my business to. I think last year, Bank of America tried charging me five dollars a month for their checking services, an outrageous fee, but luckily that charge isn\u2019t going through for me. Without silly charges like that, Bank of America checking accounts are generally great. The people at my local Bank of America are nice and help solve any problems that I do have, which happens quite rarely. Overall, Bank of America is great.","782":"I've been a BOA customer for 6 years. I was initially denied a Checking Account because of my credit. However, my employer had a partnership with BOA which required all employees to have a BOA Checking Account, so I was granted an account anyway. My overall experience has been a good one. Great Customer Service and online account access.I have only had one real issue with BOA, and it happened 3 or 4 years ago. I am a resident of GA, but visited AL for a family function. I used my Debit Card a few times while in AL, but when I got back to GA my Debit Card declined when I tried to use it. I knew I had a ton of money on the card, so I had no idea what was going on. I had to call them to find out that my Checking Account has been \u201cfrozen\u201d because of a Fraud Alert. Apparently, the transactions I made in AL were suspicious. They \u201cunfroze\u201d the account while I had them on the line, and I was able to use the Debit Card right away.Other than that, my experience has been a really good one. I have a Credit Card through BOA also and rates and fees are decent for that as well.","118":"I have had this Bank of America credit card for going on five years now. It's the main credit card I use for pretty much all of my purchases. I use it mostly because I like the points system it offers, and I tend to cash that out at the end of every year. It's also nice because it's American Express, which means you get extended protection for your purchases. The only downside is that American Express is not taken everywhere, but these days it is taken almost everywhere. The interest rate isn't anything to write home about, but I typically try not to carry any sort of balance on it. Overall, I've been incredibly happy with this card and will continue to use it.","117":"I've had this credit card for a little while now. It was transferred from a Huntington Banks Credit Card about 2 years ago. I enjoy using the card and getting the Power Rewards points. It is easy to make payments on the Bank of America website. The card is accepted everywhere Visa is so it is good to have in case you have an emergency and need something quick. We use it for some automatic payment and other things every month.","116":"I have only been a Bank of America customer for a year. Before then, I was a credit union customer, so this is also my first experience with a \u201cbig name\u201d bank.What I dislike about Bank of America is that it seems as if they are kind of \u201cstingy\u201d in terms of account options. Basically, the only services of Bank of America's that I can use are the ATMs and the online and telephone customer service. If I were to request checks, or to (god forbid) want to walk into the bank and speak to a human being, I would have to pay for that service. I was extremely put off by that, but at least they offer a \u201cfree\u201d option, as I was not going to pay to be part of a bank.Besides that, I haven't had any real problems. I did have an issue with an overdraft fee and a customer service representative; the first person that I talked to told me that she couldn't help me. However, I called back and another representative graciously helped me. I guess it all depends on who you talk to. Luckily, the problem was resolved.I REALLY like the Bank of America app that allows you to deposit checks from your phone. Now, that's pretty cool. I also really like the ease and accessibility of their ATMs; it certainly is never hard to find one in the area that I live in.Overall, I'd say that Bank of America is an average bank.","781":"I have been using the BankAmericard for 6 years now and I am very content with it. Over the years this card has worked out best for me, even after the first 15 months. I have had to report lost before and was able to call and get a new card in a very efficient manner. When I go out of state they are sure to call me and make sure that my card is being used by the correct card holder which I like VERY much. Overall, the fees are small, the service is good and the credit limit is reasonably raised as I have wished. I would recommend this card to a new credit card user.","780":"Ten years ago, I opened my very first checking account at Bank of America. At first I loved them and the service was great, however that went downhill quickly. For the first few months there were no service fees, everything was just how they explained it would be. Then the random service fees- that I was told I would not have to worry about- started. Monthly maintenance fees, fees for not having enough in my account, fees for having too much in my account... I could never keep track, but they were always charging me for something. I ended up getting fed up with their monthly fees so I stopped using my account, only to come back months later and discover they had been tacking on an overdraft fee each time a monthly fee was applied to my account. I had stopped using my account, so I didn't notice this until I was $300+ overdrawn. Thankfully their customer service is not that bad, it was fixed for me and I started using my account again. Then things got really bad. For example oftentimes, transactions would not post right away, so when I checked my account online it would look like I had more money than I did. Once I accidentally overdrew my account by .04 cents, and was charged a $30 overdraft fee. Instead of putting a stop on the card, or at the very least calling\/emailing to warn about the card being overdrawn, they would keep adding overdraft fees for each day my account was negative, and each time you used my debit card. Since it looked like the money was in there when I checked my account, I didn't think I was overdrawing my account. Again, customer service was generally pretty understanding the first couple times this happened. But it seemed like no matter how careful I was, I was constantly overdrawn. Recently I stopped using my account because I feel like I have lost (or almost lost) so much money to them. I am currently shopping around for a new bank that does not have outrageous fees.","819":"Bank of America deserved a 4.5 out of 5 star rating for the very simple reason that it provides the services expected, but does so in an unremarkable way. There are many branches, which is obviously very convenient. Most branches operate during the hours one would expect for a bank and are outfitted with ATMs. In 20 years with Bank of America I have never encountered a teller that failed to be friendly and helpful. I have procured an auto loan for them in past. I don\u2019t recall the interest rates, but I do remember that it was fair and competitive. The online experience with Bank of America is also extremely satisfactory with up-to-the-minute transaction history as well as the ability to transfer funds between accounts. I am pleased enough with Band of America that I have never seriously considered moving to another bank. Anytime I have been recommended to switch by a friend or coworker, I decide against it after the most basic of comparisons. Bank of America provides the service that I expect from a bank and I don\u2019t see switching any time soon.","119":"I have been a Bank of America customer for over 7 years now. I have to say I have been with them so long because of their excellent customer service and customer values. If I found myself having many issues with my accounts, like stolen debit cards, overdraft fees, or things of that nature, they are able to handle it or help me ASAP and best they can. For example I lost my bank card, but did not realize it till the next morning. There were charges made by someone else in a different city, but I had no worries for me. I knew Bank of America would have my back and they did. A Representative was able to reimburse me for the money spend and ship me a new bank card within 3 business days! I will continue using this bank for many years to come!","810":"I have had a checking account with Bank of America for about nine years now. They were the first and only bank I\u2019ve ever had a checking account with because they were the bank my mom used when I got my first job. I\u2019ve talked a lot about switching banks over the years because of various things like their fees. But, ultimately, the one thing that keeps me with them is the fact that their branch and ATM locations are so convenient in my town. They also have a great user-friendly website that lets me manage my checking, savings, and credit card accounts. And their handling of disputed charges is great too.","812":"I have had my Bank of America checking account since I was very young and I have had no issues with them. Since I've had the account for so long, I don't get charged a monthly fee for it and things continue to run smoothly. Bank of America is great because they're available all over the country, in any area. The reason my account has no fees is because I have an account that only allows me to complete transactions over the Internet. Previously, I could only go to the ATM until online banking became such a convenience. If I do have to go to a teller, it's about a 4 dollar fee, but that is rare. My checking account is great and convenient!","813":"The interest rate on this card became INSANE when I missed one payment on this card after a flawless two year record with it. They offered tons of incentives to use this card recklessly and then hiked up the interest rate and dropped my credit limit. There was little to no help from representatives when I needed information concerning my Bank of America account.The terms and conditions seemed to change almost monthly with no notification or explanation. I have a deep dislike for this bank and wouldn't recommend a charge account with BoA, or any kind of account for that matter. I believe this is one of the worst financial institutions menacing the public today.","814":"BOA randomly sent me an application for this card a few years ago. I had recently paid off and closed out all of my credit cards because I don't like to carry debt. But, I was interested because I have a Checking and Savings Account with BOA already. My interest rate is what I had on some of my other credit cards, so that's fine. I use the card when I want to make a fairly large purchase, so I accumulate a lot of points. I typically just use the points to get an Amazon Gift Card and give it to my kiddies. There are cards with better reward programs, but for what I need, this card is just fine.","815":"I was with Bank of America for quite some time a few years ago. The number of branch locations and ATMs available made it my first choice. They were close to my work, and near where I lived, so getting to the bank was never a problem. Even after I moved to another city, there were still plenty of available locations. The problems I have are with their problem resolution and new card policies.I lost my wallet a major mall, and as such, cancelled my cards. Bank of America issued a new one to me without delay, and I received the card a few days later. However, they had issued me a card with the exact same number as the on the that was lost. Shortly afterwards, a few suspicious charges popped up on my account. I called to have them deleted, but they said that since I had not reported that card lost or stolen, (Since it had the same number), and the purchases were made at a POS terminal, they would not reverse a charge I had made. At the time the transactions were made, I was at work, and could prove that point, but I spent over a year arguing with Bank of America, before I finally gave up and closed my account.I was also not happy with the amount you could overdraft your account at an ATM. I paid my bills through Money Orders, and would go to the ATM to withdraw the money. Twice, I miscalculated the amount in my account, and was able to withdraw money up to $300 over what I had in the bank.Overall, I do not think that Bank of America is a good bank to choose for security or safety when it comes to your money.","816":"Bank of America has done a lot of suspicious things to try and steal money away from its customers. They reordered my debit card transactions several times so that I overdrafted my account four or five times instead of the one time it should have happened. They also offered me a student account, but neglected to give me the benefits of the student account and then said that the student does not exist anymore even though I have several friends still using the student account option. Overall, Bank of America is a terrible bank and I am going to get a new bank as soon as possible.","811":"I have been a member of Bank of America for about 3 years now and it is by far one of the best banks I have ever dealt with. I am always greeted by a friendly associate when I have gone into the branch for anything and they have always taken the extra time to talk to my children and make them feel welcome and special as well. I also have had almost all positive experiences when I have had to call into the corporate office. My only complaint with corporate is that oftentimes you get someone that does not speak much English and the barrier can be frustrating. I would suggest Bank of America to my friends and family without even thinking about it. Thank you.","818":"This is one of the best cards that I have had. Bank of America is very helpful and will work with you when there is a charge that you are unaware of or if you need to dispute a defective product. There is always someone available in customer service any time of day to assist you. I also like that this card gives you cash back bonuses. I can use the card for everyday purchases and earn money in return. I would highly recommend this card to anyone who is looking for a good credit card company.","783":"In My opinion this Bank of America Travel Rewards Credit card has a lot of good features fro travelers 1) No Annual Fee 2) No Foreign Transaction fee; which is great to have it if you travel overseas or process transactions with merchants outside the USA, (Other Banks will charge you up to 3%, or you will have to pay an annual fee waive it i.e Chase Sapphire) 3) 1.5 points per dollar expended 4) Chip Technology or EMV Card at no charge (Other Banks will charge an annual fee too) which I think is a good feature for international travelers). 5) Visa Signature Benefits if you credit history Qualifies. 6) Bank of America Deals 7) 10% annual bonus on points earned if you have a qualified B of A Checking account. 8)Possibility to get up to 3 points per dollar when you buy your airline tickets thru B of A travel Center 9) World Wide acceptance. ) Besides to redeem your points to pay for travel related expenses I think you can even get cash back, but check with B of A for more details. Do you need more benefits?Bottom Line, Bank of America has been pretty aggressive offering this competitive Credit Card among other reward\/travel credit cards offered in the market.","784":"This is a great credit card because you immediately earn 3% cash back on gas, 2% cash back on groceries, and 1% cash back on everything else. I also use the Add It Up deals where I get 3-10% cash back on my online purchases. There is also the BankAmeriDeals that change every couple of weeks. In the past, I have received 15% cash back on PetSmart and 20% cash back on my purchases at Menchies Frozen Yogurt. Another great thing about this credit card is that Bank of America offers a \"Special Offer\" of a one year McAfee virus protection. This offer itself saved me a good amount of money! Lastly, I can also get in for free to the LA County Museum of Art on the first weekend of every month!","788":"Bank of America has changed over the last ten years but not for the better. I have a checking, savings and credit card with BOA but they charge me $14 dollars to get a cashier\u2019s check. When you ask \u201cwhy does it cost so much?\u201d and the teller responds with \u201chow else do you expect us to make money?\u201d, you get the feeling that service is not at the forefront. I did not have time to explain the banking system and interest to the teller but it probably didn't matter.My checks specifically have increased at least 15% every time I need to replace them. Both checks and cashiers should be free, especially if they are taking the money out of my account on the spot.To be fair, they will try to meet you with a smile at the front desk. The line is generally reasonable at the locations I frequent. It is the BOA policies that make the customer service difficult for the employees.","785":"This is the first credit card I have ever owned, so I can't really compare it to others by experience. I'm really happy with it, however. I got the credit card during the time that I needed to purchase a train ticket, so I used it to buy the ticket for $400+ the first month and after I spent 100 or so on groceries and gas, I received $100 back! It was like I got a big discount on my train ticket. This was about five months ago. So far, after using the card on groceries and gas, I received back over $100 for 5 months. So that's like a total of $200 or so that I saved in 5 months. I didn't do all the details with how much I saved, but seeing as I have more money in my bank than I did before when I used a debit card for groceries and gas, I think I saved a lot.","1734":"I am currently (maybe) a member of the Bank of America, only because of the horrible experience and amount of time it takes to actually quit being a member of the Bank of America. I originally moved to BoA because Regions bank removed the option of inserting checks directly in their drive-thru ATMs. I found this ridiculous and a huge inconvenience, so I moved everything over to Bank of America.But, I got married about six months ago and wanted to switch banks to Wells Fargo and share an account with my wife. I went in to Bank of America, right up to a bank teller, and told her I wanted to close my account. She told me she wouldn't do it and that I had to meet with one of the other employees. She sat me down to wait and I sat there for 30-minutes with no one coming to talk to me. It was as if they were going to ignore me unless I stayed with their bank. I got annoyed and left.Since then I have returned two more times, went to the first open bank teller, and asked to close my account, but again, I was told I had to wait for another employee to call me in their office. I found this ridiculous, so I just tore up my Bank of America card and decide to forget all about them.","1733":"Bank of America has been extremely reliable and understanding over the years. I like that they take your picture and put it right on your card for you. One unlikely event really cemented their great reputation for me. I accidentally left my debit card in the drive through ATM one night after withdrawing some cash. I had parked my car in the lot and was looking over some stuff when some guys in a truck pulled up and told me I had left my card in the machine and threw it into my window. I didn't think much of it until I went home and checked my balance. They actually stole money from my account before returning the card! When I told the lady in the bank it didn't really seem like she believed me, which is understandable, but she refunded my account anyway! Now that is really excellent customer service in my opinion.","1732":"Our business has been banking with Bank of America for five years. Our experience with this institution has been satisfactory, though not extremely pleasant. The proximity of the locations to us is convenient, and the deposit-making there is easier than at some other banks we've tried. Still, the experience with the tellers and management has never been too impressive. Often the tellers and managers are short and rude, and almost every time we have to go into the bank they are working extremely slowly. The people that are working at the business line often help regular customers before us, which interferes with our business. Overall, our experience with Bank of America has been mediocre.","1731":"Bank of America has saved my life (well, financially) more than once! Their customer protection program is incredibly effective. I've had my card number stolen a couple of times, and each time I'm alerted by BoA before I even notice an issue and they refund the money stolen and shut down my card quickly to make sure no other activity can occur. I feel very secure when banking with Bank of America, and that's incredibly important to me in this age of online fraud and considering the ease with which people can access your personal information. The customer service representatives themselves are also incredibly friendly, sympathetic, and helpful, which is especially needed when you find yourself in another state with no apparent access to funds after your card has been stolen! The customer service rep told me where to find the nearest Bank of America branch, and called ahead to let them know I was coming so I didn't have to wait long for help. Overall, a good banking experience and I recommend this institution.","1730":"I am a graduate student and have had a checking and a savings account with Bank of America since I was 16. I have attended three different universities during my undergraduate and graduate studies in California, Arizona, and Florida. In each instance, I have always had easy access to a branch. I also travel domestically a great deal for my studies. An account with Bank of America makes finding an ATM or, in case I need to speak with someone, a branch an easy task. During my research abroad experiences, the online banking makes handling my money and paying my bills in foreign countries very convenient. I have always enjoyed pleasant and efficient customer service. I would recommend Bank of America to anyone.","786":"I have nothing but good things to say about the Bank of America cash rewards credit card. I use it solely to purchase gas and groceries, as those two purchases give you the largest reward. These are weekly purchases, so they quickly add up to being beneficial. You can make your payments directly from your bank account using BOA\u2019s online feature, which is extremely nice and very convenient. I had trouble setting up the payment option on the online banking, and the representative took the time to walk me through the process to ensure that not only was it set up properly, but that I had a clear understanding of how to utilize this feature in the future.One of the added bonuses is that you also receive free checks. The customer service is also stellar. Overall, very good card, amazing benefits and helpful customer service.","789":"After coming out of bad credit, this was one of the credit cards I was able to obtain. After getting rid of bad credit you do not want to take a ton of credit hits applying for several different cards. This card is pretty much a sure bet for approval but it does come with fees. If rebuilding your credit or starting new credit, it is worth the money to build that new credit. The hits are considered soft hits but they still calculated somehow into your credit. I recently was automatically charged with the annual fee without warning but if you pay attention to to limit, you should not have a problem. On a side note, when I did have credit issues, Bank of America went on the attack despite the fact I have been a customer for at least fifteen years. No mercy was given. If you get this card, keep it up to date.","787":"I have had a mixed experience but overall I am satisfied with Bank of America. I do most of my banking online and they have excellent online services. I use the app to transfer funds between my two accounts and to easily wire money to family members out of state if needed. The user interface both on a computer and iPhone app are very easy to use and I am grateful that they have good developers working for us.When I signed up, the process was easy and I really appreciated when they changed my account type based on my actual usage. This helped save me a little in fees each year. I also have had great in-person experience when I have had to go into a branch to order a new card or perform a transaction.My only point of contention with my bank is their conflict resolution and difficulty in dealing with the fraud protection system. I had some odd activity, some my fault and some not, that resulted in NSF fees. They would only partially forgive the ones that were not my fault. I have never asked for fee forgiveness when I was at fault but they did not help me out much at all in that case. The fraud protection can be trying. It is an automatic system and, in my case, I made an emergency midnight run to Walmart while on vacation and was locked out of my account until the next business day when I could get a person on the phone. It was a really big inconvenience.Overall, I like BoA but some of their practices need tweaking.","1735":"While Bank of America is one of the most widely spread and most recognizable financial institutions, it'll always leave a bitter taste in my mouth. In college, I was suckered into getting a credit card due to free pizza and a t-shirt, but I didn\u2019t know anything about interest rates or hidden fees. With Bank of America, the fees kept on coming in from left field, and the interest rate (though I always paid on time) was enormous for a college kid. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of these guys until you're older and know something about something.","1940":"I have been a loyal Bank of America customer for quite some time. Three years ago, I found out that I would be working abroad the majority of the year. I discussed my various banking options with BoA and they were extremely helpful and accommodating. They helped me find a partner bank that I could link my account to overseas, they helped me apply for a no-overseas-fee credit card, and they were generally very personable and interested in my best banking experience. On the several occasions I've had problems while overseas, BoA has been extremely understanding and easy to deal with both online and on the phone. When I have banked with them while in the States, they have been equally helpful. I will continue to bank with BoA long into the future.","1739":"I have to be honest, I've had nothing but trouble with Bank of America. The travel rewards connected to this card are kind of pathetic when you compare them to the benefits of other cards. It seems like they just wanted to jump on the travel card bandwagon without any actual research on what other cards offer. I've gotten several past due notices with this card even after I provided proof to the company that my balance was paid in full and on time. I found customer service rude and very reluctant to reverse penalty charge errors, although BoA will slap a bunch of them on you in a split second. I heard that this organization was trying to re-vamp itself to keep up with the times and compete with more progressive banks but I find no evidence of this at all. I only had this card for a very brief window of time when my current fiance was a boyfriend and I had moved to another state to co-habitate. He had BoA and I gave it a chance. It was a bad move on my part. I'm still dealing with strikes on my credit reports that BoA was kind enough to give me. They are way more generous with these than they are flight miles.","1738":"Bank of America is a covinient bank that offers superb customer service. Having banked with them for several years, I enjoy their convinient hours. The banks are always clean and the lines move very quickly. I have never had to wait in line more than 5 minutes to be assisted. Any issues Ive had with stolen \/ lost ATM cards were resolved quickly and compassionately. I enjoy the tellers company and their seriousness when dealing with my account. I can always rely on their expertise for knowledge on how to save and which accounts I should open. Check them out. You'll love them.","1941":"My experience with Bank of America has been hassle-free and positive. I was a little skeptical about opening an account at Bank of America, due to all of the negative stories I have heard on the news. Opening my account could not have been easier. They offered me the best possible account for my current situation. The fees are reasonable and possibly avoidable. They also offer ways to earn cash back on purchases you make every day. Bank of America makes online banking simple and effortless. I have always had a positive experience with this bank, regardless of all of the negative opinions I have heard.","1737":"I have the Bank of America cash rewards credit card, and have nothing but positive things to say about the entire program. One outstanding perk is free checks, but the customer service benefits are amazing. I recently made a banking error by accidentally sending myself a check from my credit card account instead of paying the balance which was due. I logged into my account to find the error, and a $35 late fee had been deducted from my account.I called Bank of America service center, explained my error and they immediately deleted the late fee. They also checked to ensure that my payment had gone through, then asked if they could help with anything else.They most certainly did not have to cancel the late fee for my error, but it further proved what a good bank Bank of America is. The cash rewards program, which gives a percentage back into your checking for grocery and gas purchases, is one of the best banking programs around.","1736":"I've used the Bank of America Visa for about 10 years and I have no reason of letting it go. They've even detected fraudulent activity with my card once, and quickly let me know. (After a short phone interview I was reimbursed.) I would say the interest payments can get a little high but having the card integrated with my bank is very convenient. On a negative note Bank of America's costumer service leaves a lot to be desired and you can be re-connected to another representative several times before talking to the right one. I wish the charges\/payment showed up a bit faster on my account page.","3508":"STAY AWAY FROM BANK OF AMERICA I have delt with Bank Of America one time and only time I was going to college and from my loan the school sent me what was left after paying for my classes i deposited 1800 by the time I got what I needed I had five hundred dollard left so I had a bill that needed to get paid and it was not even close to five hundred dollars well in the mean time I paid and a year later I get a collection notice from the company that I paid the bill to they said that the bank never release the fund to them and I was mad because the money was in the account and they did not release the funds to the comapny so make long story short Bank Of America riped me off hundred of dollars for overdrafts that I did not do because I was very careful of my money because of bills that I had to pay and I was working at the time and when I got a settlement papers in the mail about Bank Of America charging overdraft fees when customers have money in there account I\u00a0 accepted the settlement and a year later I only got of all the money they have taken from me was 15.78 out of all the money they took from me all they think about is themselfs and for the people that think the world of that comapny that are blind because they are a ripe off they take what does not belong to them and they are not willing to admit that they were wrong and won't give back what they took. STAY AWAY FROM BANK OF AMERICA","1945":"I've had a Bank of America checking and savings account for about 3 years now and it\u2019s been nothing but convenience. The online banking is flawless and the rewards system has great incentives. The only downside to the regular savings account is the low APY, but this is not uncommon for large financial institutions. I would give Bank of America 5 stars if it wasn\u2019t for one recent incident. I scheduled a wire transfer and was waiting for the confirmation when I received a suspicious looking email and a phone call soon after, requesting my social security number because of a pending wire transfer. I was unsure if the email and phone call were legitimate and so I called Bank of America support, who assured me that everything was legitimate. During all this, my online account was frozen for some reason, so I had no idea what was going on. My accounts could\u2019ve been emptied out and I wouldn\u2019t have even known. In the end, everything was resolved and I was able to complete the wire transfer. However, it took an hour of nerve-wracking and frustrating phone calls that led to this resolution.","1943":"My only biggest criticism with this card (or anything Bank of America (BoA), for that matter) is dealing with the customer service\u2014I\u2019ve had really long wait times, been transferred from one department to another and I\u2019ve had some of the Customer Service Representatives give me moments of silence as if I said that I have earwigs living in my brain). I really can\u2019t wait to pay off this outstanding balance, close this card and move to another major bank that is NOT BoA nor Wells Fargo or to a card supported by a credit union. Other than that, I\u2019ve been particularly okay with this piece of plastic. It is my first credit card that I\u2019ve ever had (I opened it in 2004, solely for the reason that this bank is in my suburb, my paychecks were issued by this bank and that, at the time, this was the only major bank that The University of Texas allowed for online transactions). I\u2019ve enjoyed only one of the rewards, and that is redeeming my points for cash back\u2014I use that cash to help me pay off this debt :-)","1944":"Bank of America has been my \u201cgo to\u201d bank for many years. I have had a few problems with deposits\/withdrawals, but they were cleared up within minutes. I have never had any unknown monthly fees or anything that some other banks do. I only use this bank for checking\/credit card purposes. In the future if I need anything else, I will definitely go to Bank of America to see if their other services are just as good as the ones I get now. Overall, I like Bank of America for my needs at the time being \u2013 and they meet them exceedingly well.","1946":"You only ever hear about the bad things that the big bad banks like Bank of America do. Now, while Bank of America has certainly done things that deserve the ire of consumers nationwide, there are also the success stories and the good experiences. I am one of those customers that has never had an issue with Bank of America and has actually had nothing but good experiences along the way. I have had a checking and savings account with Bank of America for about ten years, and while I do not remember the application process well, I do remember it being quite easy and straightforward. I do not pay anything for my checking account as long as I maintain a certain balance, but since this balance is much lower than what I myself ensure I keep as a minimum balance, I have never taken issue with this aspect of my account. Only once have I ever had a real issue with my Bank of America account, and that was when somehow my card was used in Dubai while I was sitting comfortably in a hotel in Los Angeles. I immediately received a phone call from the fraud department and I was asked where I was, to which I replied and was told that my card had been used three times at the Dubai airport. I assured the representative that this was not an authorized use of the card, and she proceeded to tell me that the proper forms would be sent in the mail and I would not be responsible for any of the charges. Easy, painless, and something I was glad to hear, given the situation. Overall, while not many things may stand out as incredible about Bank of America, I have had a very solid relationship with the bank and have no real complaints.","1947":"My experience with Bank of America (or \u201cBofA\u201d) or has been subpar at best. Since day one I've had problems with the account and with it being electronic only. It is that much tougher to figure out a problem. Bank of America's online account system can be confusing due to its cluttered page layout and will sometimes take days to show an accurate amount due to their faulty banking system. Then we come to Bank of America's customer service. If you have an electronic only account you have to pay a fee of ten dollars just to speak to a teller which can be ridiculous because the bank\u2019s ATMS are constantly breaking down or crashing.","1942":"This was my first personal credit card that did not require a co-signee. My main reason for applying for this card was to get the 1,2,3 cash rewards. At first I felt that the rewards were too slow, however as I kept seeing my monthly statements I saw the dollars add up. A great incentive was the $100 cash back for using the card for 3 months and spending at least a combined $500. The money went right into my account at the 3 month mark. I also feel that having your cash backs put into a BoA account is really convenient and the bank gives an extra 10% every time the cash is redeemed and deposited into a BoA checking account. The only draw back is that you have to do it in increments of $25 which is a little high. However, the monthly Bank \"amerideals\" is great as extra cash back ids given if purchases are made at specific vendors. A good aspect of this is that the deals do not have a cap so even if you make a few dollars from the \"Bamk amerideal\" you will get that money in your checking account by the end of the month. I have loved the card so far and have not had any issues with it.","1948":"This bank is one of the best in the country. I just started a checking account at this bank and so far I have really enjoyed the experiences I have had. I use this bank also for savings. I got a savings account for free when I got a checking account. I also got 25 dollars for free for starting an account which was nice. They also have a lot of ATMs all over town so when you need money, it will be really easy to find an ATM. I really recommend them to anyone that is looking for a good bank with excellent customer service.","1690":"I've used Bank of America for my savings and checking from the time I was first able to get checking account. That was an awesome choice since I travel around to different parts of the US and there is always a Bank of America around. They tend to be fair with overdraft. If you have 5 back to back transactions while being overdrawn they will usually waive the fee of four of them and only charge you the overdraft fee once. Overall, I've been very content with the service I have received. I would recommend having direct deposit from your job so that they will waive the checking account fees. Also, I once had my card used illegally and they credited my account back right away even though the money was already taken from my checking account. They also looked into how I used the account as apparently my info was stolen while making an online transaction.","1698":"I have been a member at Bank of America for the past 7 years. I started with a Student Checking account which has since \u201cgraduated\u201d into my primary account. Over the years, I have dealt with lost cards, accidental overdrafts, and a variety of issues. Bank of America has always been prompt and gives me a real person and not a recording when I call Customer Service, which is rare in this time! This bank has shown great understanding and they cancelled overdraft fees for me when I was low on money in college.I love the \u201cSave your change\u201d feature which rounds up purchases to the nearest dollar amount and takes that change and puts it into your savings account. Recently, I just became aware of the Rewards program through the Checking service. I've started to rack up points on basic purchases, including the ones I make at my grocery store!Their Online Banking is the best I have experienced. It is easy to check balances, purchases, transfer funds, and pay bills online (even from my phone.) There is Bank of America in every state I have visited and I never have trouble finding a location.Overall, this bank is fantastic!","1696":"I started banking through Bank of America four years ago when I moved to Texas. I have not had any problems with them. It was really easy to set up my account; someone helped me the second I walked in. They have always been courteous and generous whenever I have had to contact\/visit them. They do not offer free checking accounts anymore, but if you set up direct deposit, the fee is waived. The features they offer on their online access are quite useful. It is really easy to check your balance or current statement (past ones are also available). It is also really easy to transfer money between your accounts or pay bills. They have a mobile application, but I do not have much experience with it. Overall, I am very satisfied with my banking experience through Bank of America.","1695":"I've had a Bank of America checking account for several years now, and really the only reason I've kept the account is the pure convenience of their locations in proximity to my home and work. They have made mistakes with my account, at my financial detriment several times, and refused to remedy the situation in such a way that was favorable to me. I've had very poor experiences with their phone support employees, who have been very unfriendly, unhelpful and completely uninterested in helping me to solve the issues I was having with my account. Several times I have made transfers from one account to another, and twice they processed my transfers two times, thus overdrawing the account I was transferring from, and sticking me with overdraft fees. I am very disappointed with their service overall, and I feel they have stolen money from me. I will be switching to a local credit union as soon as I am able.","1699":"In the years I've had an account at Bank of America, they've always been completely helpful and the account easy to use. Depositing checks and cash at ATMs is convenient, and their app also lets you deposit checks through your cell phone. When my debit card number was compromised, all money was returned to me immediately and their fraud department made sure that I was not liable for the false charges. Their website is very simple to understand and all statements are updated consistently, so you are always completely aware of your account balance. I would highly recommend using Bank of America to anyone.","1694":"This card is the most recent credit card I have applied for. I applied for it because I bank though Bank of America. I was a little disappointed by my initial credit limit, but overall all the benefits of having this card outweighed the negative. Bank of America\u2019s online banking is very convenient and easy to use. All of my accounts show up in one place; it is really easy to make payments and view my balances. The rewards on this card are also very useful. They add up really fast, and there are a lot of different options you can use them on. I just recently got a $50 gift card to Nike.com. As mentioned before, it is really easy to make payments and keep track of your balances on this card (especially if you have other Bank of America accounts). I recommend this card to anyone who has the ability to get it.","1693":"As my first credit card, it's good in doing what it's supposed to. I received the card a week or so after applying for it online, with a credit limit of $300. Making payments towards my bill is effortless thanks to bill pay, and I can contact support if I ever require help through BoA's 24\/7 call center. The APR on this is pretty solid as well. There are some things I wish the card had though: things like cash back rewards on things I buy daily, a rewards program, and maybe even purchase protection. Besides all the negatives, it's a good card for those building credit!","1692":"I have been with Bank of America since 2007. Any time there has been an issue, Bank of America was quick to respond and let me know the process to fix it. I have always felt like I could get the issue resolved on the first call, without needing to call back later. The representatives are always very friendly, and are able to answer my questions quickly. The only problem I have is getting through the phone system to speak to someone, but once I do, it's smooth sailing from there! If there was an easier way to get on the line with an actual person, it would be nice, but for the most part I always feel taken care of and valued.","1691":"I joined with Bank of America when I moved, simply because it was a bank that I could take with me from state to state. Now that I am officially a Bank of America customer, I think it is a lot more than just a convenience to have if you travel out of state.I have a checking and a savings account presently open. There are a lot of things I like about banking with them, for both accounts. My favorite thing about Bank of America is the mobile app. I can deposit checks, transfer money between accounts as well as other people, and monitor account activity. Another thing I really like is the Keep The Change option that I have. Sometimes, I lack in putting money into my savings.With Keep The Change, it makes it easy for me to at least deposit something into my savings account. In the first month, I had $50 in my account! Its a great option for customers to have.I've had a couple of problems with them, but like any bank there are issues. I called customer service and they handled my problems in a short time and refunded any fees that I had due to the issues.","1697":"Bank of America is basically your run-of-the-mill bank. Their biggest positive is that they have ATMs everywhere. The biggest negative is that they are almost monolithic in their bureaucracy. However, I have been a customer for many decades and my overall experience has been very up and down. It really depends on who you get at the other side of the phone or the desk. In that sense, they are way too big \u2013 do not expect that neighborly service you'll get from your local bank or credit union. As a long, long time customer, I can say that I do not feel honored in any way for my lengthy commitment to the bank. I still get monthly fees and penalties just like everyone else. I would not discourage anyone from getting an account here; however, I would not expect anything special. If anything, they are ubiquitous and easily accessible.","1949":"I have had this credit card since 2007, and I love it. I like being able to earn points when using my card, so instead of using a debit card, I use this. I just pay it off every month with my checking account. When I have accumulated enough points, I redeem them for cash which goes straight into my checking account using the Bank of America Worldpoints store. It's like being paid to spend money I would already spend anyway! It's also easy to make payments on, and the online banking is really clear and concise. I have never had an issue with my card that customer service was not able to clear up with a quick phone call.","578":"Bank of America has many flaws. Some of its characteristics are good, some are bad. Be very careful when banking with this bank as they will rob you and not give you your money back. We have been with Bank of America for a while now and we are not very pleased with them. We ordered some phones online and we canceled the order and never got the phones. We used our debit card to pay for the order. Well, Bank of America paid the phone company anyway for phones we never received and canceled. We contacted Bank of America and they said there was nothing to be done, so we lost 200.00 and had to pay it back to the bank since our account was now negative. So, their banking service is bad.","570":"This credit card has been a trusty companion since I started college. IT was the first and only credit card I was issued, and it only had a $500 limit on it, but it has saved my bacon quite a few times. Although the interest rate for me was slightly steep, I credit that with having no credit prior to signing up for it. The rule of thumb for users just beginning with credit and having nothing on their credit report is to pay your bills on your card, and pay it off at the end of every month, this will help jack up your credit score quick.","571":"This card is a good card. It was my first credit card and even though I didn't have credit I was still approved. The 1-2-3 benefits actually come in handy, and I've saved at least a few hundred bucks on groceries. The gas doesn't really add up because the gas is 10 cents more when you pay with credit card. The 100 buck bonus when signing up was really good, and now I feel like I'm actually doing something good for a cause that I believe in. I have no complaints about this card, and dealing with boa is an ease. The app on my iphone is super easy to use, and I never have to deal with papers or anything.","572":"I signed up for Bank of America's checking account about 5 years ago and I have never been happier with a bank. Not only was I able to sign up online (you need to verify the account at the local branch eventually) which was a breeze, but also their free checking required no minimum balance. I also signed up for their \u201ckeep the change\u201d promotion which works as a virtual piggy bank. Now, every time I use my debit card the card rounds the transaction up to the nearest dollar and transfers the balance of the transaction into my savings account. Only once did I have any issues with my account. A check did not get recorded as deposited. I called their customer service line, and spoke to a live person who helped me through it. Not only did he immediately credit my account, but within two days confirmed that mistake was on their end. Great customer service and fast acting when it counts!","573":"I have three criticisms about this checking account with Bank of America (BoA) and only two of them are big. I had to open this account because this bank is in my home suburb. It was the bank that issued paychecks at my job and was the only bank that was authorized to process electronic transactions at my undergraduate college of The University of Texas. The first criticism out of all of this is that I had to have a minimum of over $1000 in order to keep the account free. As soon as I dipped below this number I had to pay around $11 monthly to keep it open. What a price to pay given the state of our current economy! This bank could learn from Wells Fargo and\/or credit unions that offer free checking accounts to college students and the general public, respectively. The second criticism was that when I had to close this account, the workers at the branch made a production out of it, even as to go as far and tell me that I was rude (!). Again, a lesson could be learned from Wells Fargo \u2013 when I had to close an account there, the workers gave me no issue. Finally, the last hurdle I had to jump was the money order price: at the time it was around $5 for a money order, but this shock was softened by a nice worker who told me \u201cOh, you shouldn't get them from here, mi'jo. They're pretty expensive!\u201d Now, THAT'S a lesson that should be taught to all bank employees. More positive news about this checking account was that I had no issue with bank errors or suspicious charges and the like, so that's why my star review is in the \u201calright\u201d range. All of that said, READER BEWARE: take review with a grain of salt. This was MY experience, not that of anyone else. You could and\/or others have good experiences with BoA, so, like with everything, this checking account is not for everyone; it wasn't for me.","575":"I have been banking with Bank of America since 1998 (for 15 years). If I ever had an issue with my checking account, they resolved it. Questions? Answered. In all the years, I have been very blessed to have never had one bad experience with them.I have referred friends and family to bank with Bank of America and they too have said they LOVE banking here now. If there is anything you are looking for, they have it. They are available whenever I need them and make my life so easy. You can have everything in one place. Car loan, checking, savings, mortgage and more. You can also get a 35% discount on TurboTax. You can't get banking services better than this anywhere else!","576":"I\u2019ve been with Bank of America for about 5 years now, because I wanted the convenience of being able to do all my banking (personal checking, business checking, mortgage and credit card) in one bank. They have a very robust web interface, almost like using a Quicken desktop application at your disposal for no additional charge. They have an online chat help feature, which I find very handy (I prefer to use chat for support, because I can multitask). And when I\u2019ve had to call for help, customer service has always been helpful, easy to understand, etc. I love the convenience of their drive through ATMS and drive through tellers, and I love the new feature of being able to deposit checks into my business account by using the iPhone app. I feel like I\u2019m a valued customer and am treated well (my husband and I are considered some sort of higher tier customer due to the number of accounts we carry with them between the two of us). I know they\u2019re one of the so-called \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks, but they\u2019ve done right by me.","577":"I didn't have the best experience with my old bank so I decided to change things up last year. Bank of America seemed like the best bet for my business and it definitely was. They helped me set everything up and transfer everything with ease. The business solutions have proved to be quite helpful and their customer service is always prompt and professional, something I wasn't quite used to. I will say though that their automated phone service sucks, but once you get a hold of someone, it's great. I don't have a huge business, but Bank of America suits all of my needs and I'm happy to be with them.","574":"A great card all around, 1 point for each dollar spent, and 2 points on all amtrak travel. No hidden fees or APR as well. Given that 4,000 points leads to a free one way on the northeast corridor it takes no real time to get there. Plus this card is backed by Chase who are a dream to call if there is an issue, no real wait times and always pleasant and helpful unlike when I would call Bank of America before. One of the best rewards cards out there, plus you can buy gift cards and other things with your points too. Try calling Amtrak if you want one though, often you get a bigger sign up bonus. When I signed up for mine I got 36,000 points because of a bonus going on. Like I said easily one of the best rewards cards around, especially if you are a frequent business traveler on trains.","579":"Okay, so it's pretty obvious that the O's aren't going to do much in terms of championships, but that doesn't really matter to me. I've been a life long fan and my decision to get a Baltimore Orioles Credit Card was a sign of my commitment. I have other credit cards and barely use them. My credit was really good so I signed up for this one and it's come in pretty handy as an O's fan. The Rewards are pretty standard but that isn't to say they aren't pretty good too. Their rates are great, but that could be in part to my good credit history and rating. I use this card just a couple of times a month and have never had any issues.","326":"I had an account here till I recently closed it. They charge you various outrageous fees, everything from actually talking to a teller, having low balances or receiving paper statements, Oh, you want to let that money sit in your account for awhile? Guess what? There's a fee for that as well. While the staff at my local branch was always nice the excessive fees made dealing with this bank not worth it at all to me. I suggest you run to any other bank or better yet a credit union in your area, you can find before dealing with Bank of America. They will bleed you dry.","325":"I have been banking here for over five years, first down in Texas near Dallas, and now in the Kansas City area. Overall, I am very happy with Bank of America's service. Whenever I have called for the rare service charge they have always been willing to reverse it. I love their online banking and all of the services that are included with it. The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is that their loans are not really competitive. I have tried to get a loan with them for a few big ticket items (i.e. cars) and both times they offer some ridiculous interest rate that is always at least 4-5 points higher than the dealership itself.","320":"I have been banking with Bank of America for about a year now and things have been going well so far. I feel confident whenever I visit the actual branch that my issues will be resolved rather quickly. My husband and I were recently married, and we wanted a joint bank account to deposit our wedding gifts. We were having some issues at the beginning because I had yet to change my last name, but Bank of America was surprisingly flexible about this. They helped us set up our joint account, and we think we will be staying with them for quite some time.","321":"I have been banking with Bank of America for around six years. In my experience, their customer service team is outstanding. I have gotten many overdrafts overturned because their customer service agents were nice enough to listen to what happened and make a judgment call. While I've paid many fees in the past to Bank of America, I feel like their customer service over the years makes it worth it. Any time I needed something simple in the past, such as a replacement debit card, they were extremely fast and courteous to me on the phone.Aside from their spectacular customer service skills, their online site is a lifesaver. Keeping track of a budget for me is extremely hard at times, but having all of the information online makes budgeting out my month much easier. I never receive a paper statement anymore, which is great.The reason I gave them three stars in \u201cclear disclosures\u201d is because their policies can be hard to understand sometimes, especially when it comes to fees. It's somewhat hard to get a representative to tell you these policies in an easy to understand way, so you're left with lots of fine print to go over if you want to avoid fees.Overall, Bank of America has provided me with more happiness than headaches over the years. People may say negative things about them, but they are a functional bank with many wonderful employees who are extremely nice and helpful. I give them a 4 out of 5.","322":"I visit multiple branches in my area and have been a member for a little over a year. There are few places that have nicer people to talk to. The tellers are very helpful and offer fantastic customer service.There are a few issues though. If you need additional help outside of a teller's ability, there can be quite the wait. Those bankers that you speak with are a mixed bag of customer service and can be very slow to help.They also seem to be understaffed at busy times, in my experience, with only one or two tellers. An average amount of time in the bank is around 15 minutes.They do offer paperless checking, which is great if you don't like to waste paper.","329":"Despite it being a really large bank, I have had a great experience with Bank of America. I have a credit card, checking, and savings account with them. I like how their banks are all across the country and I love their online banking system which I use both on my computer and on my iPhone. They recently added the ability to transfer money via mobile numbers, which is a great perk. In the last few years, I have had my identity stolen a few times, mostly due to shopping online on not protected sites. In most cases, Bank of America found out it happened before I did and alerted me to this. When it happened a few years ago right around Christmas, I was completely stressed out because they had wiped out all the money in my checking account. Bank of America immediately gave me a temporary card and got me some of the money back, and the rest of the money was back in there by the next day. Even though it was a horrible experience, their customer service was excellent and got me through it.","328":"I have both a checking and savings account with Bank of America. I barely use the savings account and just keep a very small minimum in it. The rates are horrible. For my savings needs I go to other online banks. As for the checking, there is a high minimum in order not to incur charges. Otherwise, you should have a direct deposit set up (1500 minimum). Not bad but a bit high for someone. I have a direct deposit and try to keep as little money in the account as needed. I am a heavy user of credit cards for cashback and such so I just budget how much I will need and keep it in the checking account to pay off the cards. The customer service is meh. I only had to deal with them once to make sure my credit card could be used overseas. They didn't seem to get the concept or what I was requesting. It could be my fault but the other big credit card companies understood, and my card wasn\u2019t shut down for fraudulent charges overseas.","323":"I just recently began banking here. My wife has her savings\/checking accounts here, so I thought I would open a checking account too. I really like their online banking and the app they have for phones. They have really made it simple to manage your bank account online. Their service is really good at the bank too. I have gone many times to my local branch and have left very happy and have not had a bad experience there that I can recall. It was very simple to open an account and I was out of there in 30 mins. I would highly recommend banking here. I would make this my main banking service, but I\u2019m quite happy with my credit union at the moment. However, as a secondary checking account it meets my needs.","327":"I have had an account with Bank of America for just over a year now and I love it. I have the most basic of checking accounts. There are absolutely no fees as long as I do everything electronically which is no issue for me at all. There are locations and ATMs everywhere so there is no problem finding a cash machine when I need one and I love the Keep the Change program. I have saved so much with that option. I highly recommend Bank of America to anyone looking to ditch fees. America. If you are just looking for a place to keep your money without any interference or whatnot from others choose BoA.","324":"I didn't start with Bank of America. They bought my mortgage. First I was unhappy to change the way I paid but it turned out to be much easier. It was easy to set up a direct deposit and I can pay off my mortgage early. They include a few tools to see how much faster you can pay it off with different methods like biweekly payments or additional payments. You can also pay a little more on principle or escrow online. They also have a calendar that shows when you are due and where late charges come into play.The thing I use the most though is the iPhone app where you can pay your mortgage on the phone so I don't even have to log into the computer. All in all, it's not bad. They are a few things I wish they had though like an auto pay feature but I am not sure I have heard of any banks offering that.Also, if you have an escrow and it goes over the amount authorized there is no option to just put that money on the principle. They end up sending you a check at the end of the year and you have to go cash it then bring it back to them. It\u2019s kind of annoying but only happens once a year.","220":"Bank of America has been truly been attentive to me and my needs. I have had no problems with credit cards or sudden charges like it has happened to me with other banks. My account is well-protected against fraudulent crime and letters come in the mail with my balance and all that I need to know for the month. On the other hand customer service could improve a little bit more. Sometimes there\u2019s no one on the other line that can clearly answer my questions and there\u2019s even a little bit of a disrespectful tone in their voices that makes me cringe and hung up. Still, it is a really good place for your money to be.","221":"I originally signed up with Bank of America purely due to the amount of locations and ATMs that I'd see on a daily basis. I ended up leaving them due to their customer service and fees. I feel like I have never gotten so many fees in my life for stupid things that were not clearly disclosed. Such as not having an active account because I haven\u2019t used a debit card an arbitrary number of times. Why does that even matter? And when the story came out a while back about being charged a fee for a debit card, I just lost it and closed my account. You should be getting paid by your bank to keep money with them, not get charged by them.","222":"I tried paying my credit card balance online but the website was down (a common issue). Then I decided to use the chat feature for the first time and talk to a customer service rep to help pay my bill. Thankfully my bill wasn't due until at least 10 days after that day, but I like to pay my bills early. So, the chat rep took my info and said she scheduled a payment for me (did not say when). I check my account a week later and it wasn't paid!! I tried the chat feature again to ask why, and another person told me that a payment was scheduled for THE DAY THE PAYMENT IS DUE. How irresponsible! Here I am trying to be a responsible client by paying my bill way ahead of time, and BofA screws me over. So I try to actually call them to tell them I want the payment to be scheduled TODAY. Of course I'm greeted by a VERY lengthy voice machine that gives me absolutely no useful options to resolve this issue. I kept pressing 0, and was on hold for at least 15 minutes, until finally I got a hold of someone. By then I was angry because of having to maneuver the stupid voice machine and wait for so long, but I repressed my feelings and remained friendly to the customer service rep. To add insult to injury, the representative on the phone had a VERY low voice and was hard to hear. Every time she said something I had to say \u201cWhat? I can't hear you.\u201d and she would just get frustrated with ME. I had my phone volume on the highest possible level and that didn't help at all. She told me she would amend the transaction date. So, here I am waiting with my fingers crossed that this gets done. I can't believe what a hassle it is just to pay my damn credit card bill!!In a nutshell, my experience with Bank of America has been horrible and I would never recommend this bank to anyone.","223":"I've been a customer of Bank of America since my parents opened up my first savings account here in 1999. I have continued to use B of A for several reasons:- Easy Access- Online Banking Tools- Customer ServiceB of A has thousands of branches and the nation's largest network of ATMs. I never have to worry about where I can access my accounts from. Their online banking tool is one of the best that I have ever used. All my accounts are linked together (checking\/savings\/credit card) and I am able to pay my bills with absolutely no trouble from their site. Another neat feature of their online banking tool, it that you can eliminate all paper bills as they will notify you when certain bills are due (they are able to \u201clink\u201d with your cell phone company, cable provider, credit card company and have billing notifications go through them). Their customer service is also very good. I have always been greeted every time I have walked through any of their branch doors. Their tellers are professional, quick and knowledgeable. Also, if they see that lines are getting a bit long they will add on more tellers and send a CSR through the line to see if your transaction can be done quickly at an ATM instead of waiting in line.","226":"I've been a Bank of America customer for twelve years now. You read horror stories online about \u201cBig Banks\u201d, but I'm pleased that this simply hasn't been my experience with any of the three or four branches I interact with regularly. The folks who work at the branch near my business know me by name and treat me like I was Norm walking into the bar in Cheers when I stop by to make deposits.A year ago I had a small problem with my personal checking account, and the manager at a different branch was very helpful, totally professional and absolutely courteous about everything. Most importantly, he made me feel as if my little personal checking account was of the greatest single importance to him and absolutely wanted to be sure I left the bank happy that day.Bank of America has earned my business, and I'm happy to give it to them.","227":"Considering that BOA is headquartered in my home town, it makes sense that I have been banking with them for over half of my life. The thing I love most about BOA is that there is literally an ATM machine almost everywhere I go. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like that across the country. I live in Charlotte, and this is why they are so available and it makes life so easy! I will admit that over the years, BOA has done some questionable things with its rates and fees, but they always seem to correct themselves. Their customer service is top notch, and I have always been impressed and happy about that! And I have to mention their superior online services as well! I honestly don\u2019t know what I would do without the online services that I get from BOA!","224":"I have been a Bank of America customer for years (around 8 or so). I never had a problem with them until about 2-3 years ago. The customer service has become horrendous. They will not give you any answers about anything and they have the most \u201croundabout\u201d disclosures I ever heard. Numerous times, after depositing my monthly check, they hold the money for a specific amount of time (like most banks). However, they would then add on days and days. Sometimes weeks pass before I can have my money that is in my bank account and I have to go borrow money from a friend for food. Even though my money is in my bank account I can't access it. Also, the lady I tried resolving this issue with at my branch is horrible. Again, unclear disclosures, unhelpful....to the point I reported her because she would actually play some games. I know that sounds a little insane but I think she knew my husband and I reported her and she was playing little games at the teller trying to confuse us with our deposits. My husband believes she was doing so as well, so we now have a bank account at a different bank. It\u2019s going fine so far! BOA has some issues.","225":"I have a Bank of America checking account, savings account, and credit card (Visa). One very nice thing about the web site is that these three accounts are linked together. If I need to pay off the credit card, I can simply transfer money from my checking or savings account to the credit card account and it is paid off. During Hurricane Sandy, I was expecting a check in the mail from the northeast and it was delayed several days because of the storm. I had overdrafted by a few dollars because of this and got an overdraft penalty. I called their customer service and explained the situation. They undid the penalty without giving me a hard time. I was grateful for this.","228":"This was one of my first credit cards and easily the best. When I first signed up, I earned 100 dollars by spending 500 in the first 3 months. My favorite aspect about this card is there rewards page. They have a list of online merchants and the percentage cash back for each one. I usually use shoebuy.com to purchase shoes and by logging in through the Bank of America website, I was able to receive a whopping 10% cash back. They have lots of common merchants on this page and occasionally some coupon codes to go with them (I once saved 20 dollars on express.com with no restrictions). They also have a BankAmeriDeals page where they will list several merchants and they will pay up to 15% cash back in the case you use your card at that location. Also, they give 1% cash back on everything, 2% for groceries and 3% for gas. I highly recommend this card.","229":"This is a fantastic credit card. I decided to get it because I had a Bank of America checking account. The first reward I got was $100 after spending $500. I now get 1% for every purchase but an additional percent for groceries and two additional percentage points back for gas. I drive a lot for my job so that's great. By redeeming my rewards directly to my bank account, I get an extra customer bonus back of 10%. I had a few concerns once about my identity being compromised, but they took care of it and assured me everything would be okay. It's a great credit card with excellent rewards, fair rates, and incredible customer service.","360":"This is the first major credit card I have had that is worth it. A minimum of 1% cash back on EVERYTHING you buy, 2% cash back on groceries, and 3% back on gas. I buy alot of gas so this was an easy choice to make. I get rewarded for the purchases I already make. Not a ton, but enough to make a nice bonus every few months. But that's all you can really expect with a credit card. And the no annual fee is great! You can also get extra rewards for certain places too, and those are always changing. I just got 10% back at burlington coat factory.","361":"I got this card when I started college and it\u2019s been working out great for me. I can access the information safely and reliably online, without ever having to receive any paper from Bank of America. It is also great for traveling. I also feel very comfortable with the security precautions BoA takes in preventing credit card fraud: I often purchase items online from all over the world and don\u2019t always have them shipped to my address, so BoA reaches out to me to ensure that it is me doing those transactions. Sometimes a purchase can be temporarily blocked until the verification occurred, this can be done easily over the phone anytime.","366":"I got this card because I travel a lot for work and I wanted a separate card to put all those expenses on so it was easier to keep track of when doing my expense reports. I chose a \u201cRewards\u201d type card because I figured if I was spending a bunch of money (and getting reimbursed for it by my company) why not rack up a few perks, right? I chose Bank of America because I have four checking\/savings accounts with them (and a mortgage) and I wanted to be able to link the card to my other accounts for convenience. In the first year of having it I ended up with a new kitchen aid blender, Henkel\u2019s silverware for 16 just in time for Thanksgiving and a few nice gift cards to help with my Christmas shopping. The points add up so it\u2019s pretty fun. I would recommend this card.","365":"I have banked with Bank of America for about 9 years now. I would say my experience with them has been mostly positive. The benefits are lots of options for online banking and also that you can find a local branch almost anywhere in the U.S. However, there have been a few times when I considered switching banks. The first was the nationally publicized fiasco where they were strongly considering charging someone to use their debit card. Fortunately, they did not go through with it and thus I stayed a customer. I also had a personal problem where they deactivated my debit card due to questionable purchases, which were never made. I pulled $100 out of an ATM one time, which I rarely do, and they deactivated my card. I guess I should feel safe, but I'd rather them wait to deactivate it until there were multiple questionable transactions. Also, since it's a debit card, surely the fact that I had to enter my pin number for the transaction made it less questionable. The silver lining is that their problem resolution was very swift and easy. All in all, I'd recommend them.","364":"I have been a B of A customer for about 9 years. B of A is the only bank I have ever been with, and where I hold three accounts, checking, savings, and a credit card. I have had nothing but a great experience with the customer service at B of A. For 9 years, I have never been charged an account fee. I originally signed up as a student and they offered free checking. Then to keep the free checking I just had to keep a minimum balance. One particular experience I was satisfied with was when I deposited $700 cash in an ATM at school. Somehow, the ATM on my college campus was jammed and the place where you put the money into the ATM closed up and the screen read \u201cThis ATM is temporarily out of service\u201d. Before the screen went blank though, it read \u201cWe were unable to determine the cash amount deposited, please enter the amount\u201d. I entered in the amount of $700, and in good faith that this would be the amount credited to my account. I immediately called B of A from the number on the ATM and let them know the machine just went down with my money still in the dispenser, they said that my account would be credited the amount I typed in. That night I went home, did some calculations and realized I had actually put $800 in the machine. I called B of A and let them know the discrepancy and they initiated a claim, but still allowed me the extra $100 in credit. They said I would get a letter a couple of days later, after the ATM machines were balanced, if there were any issues. I received a letter stating all was fine. I was just happy that they were able to credit my money, even without knowing the exact amount I put in. They relied on what I said, and I was able to have my money that day. Also, compared to other banks their overdraft policy is not bad at all because they do not charge you if it\u2019s less than $10, or if you had money in your account the day of the transaction. The only thing I would suggest is NOT to use their online chat system. I got the runaround for about 20 minutes the time I tried. The rep (who I assume is contracted in a different country) didn't know what the heck I was trying to say. Going into the bank is the best way to get good customer service, or by calling.","362":"I first got the Alaska Airlines Credit Card two years ago. My cousin was getting married in Hawaii, and I got the card to use the $99 companion ticket. What a deal! It is great that you get the companion ticket, as well as all the miles right away...there is no waiting to spend a certain amount before you get the benefits. Getting the companion ticket once every year is really the reason that I use the card, it is a great way to earn miles and get cheap airline flights. Also, Alaska Airlines is a great carrier to fly with! Great service and great flights. I have nothing but good things to say about this card and recommend to everybody.","367":"I have been a customer of Bank of America for 6 years. I have only had good experiences with this bank. When I first got my account I accidentally overdrafted and they waived the fee. I have gone in for advice on what accounts I should open many times at different locations and they have always been very helpful. My only complaint is that at one location the person I talked to recommended against sharing an account with my boyfriend purely for personal reasons. We later changed our minds and a different person at a different location helped us create a joint account.","363":"When I was eighteen, I signed up for this card as part of a student banking package. My limit was relatively low, but I had low interest rates and it was perfect for what I needed it for. I absolutely love it and still have it today because of its ease of use. To my surprise, Bank of America has given me fantastic service when dealing with any issues that have come up and I feel very safe using this card. A few years ago, someone had stole my wallet and attempted to use my card but BoA contacted me immediately and reimbursed me for all unauthorized charges nearly instantly. Overall, I rate this card very highly.","368":"I also love using the Bass Pro Shops Credit Card. I love getting extra points on my bass pro account when using this card. The bonus is that you don't only get points when using it in the store, but you also receive points when using it on normal purchases. I use my Bass Pro Shops Credit Card for all of my purchases, in store and out, in order to rack up the points to buy fishing gear. I hardly ever use money out of my pocket when making purchases at bass pro shops. I would recommend this card to everybody, as I am extremely pleased with the card and the customer service.","369":"Bank of America is my favorite bank for managing my small business. They have a specific merchant teller window that I use so that I don't have to wait in the general line that can sometimes be a little slower during lunch hour. As long as I call a week in advance, they always have the bill denominations I need, are quick to count it in front of me and best of all I am never charged for any of the services they provide. I love that they are open on Saturdays, and also stay open until 6 pm Monday \u2013 Friday.","1460":"Bank of America has been nothing but great to me. I signed up as a college student a few years back and was given great customer service and was walked step by step through their application process. Every step was smooth from the beginning till the end, and every time I go to Bank of America to deposit money, the lines are short and the procedure is fast. I am in and out within a few minutes every time. To this day I still gladly use Bank of America due to their fantastic customer support.For instance, last year I lost my debit card late at night in the city and I called up Bank of America immediately and they reassured me that the card would be immediately canceled and they would send a replacement card ASAP. The whole entire process made me feel safe and secure. This is why I would gladly recommend Bank of America to all my friends and family.","1463":"Not a fan of Bank of America. They started charging me to use other ATMs out of the blue. They would put seemingly random holds on various deposits for insane lengths of time, sometimes 10-14 days. Fees for everything. The banking alerts to my email were way off. I would get an alert that my balance dropped below a certain level days after it actually happened. They would process charges completely out of order to let the most expensive one go through first, and then charge a $35 fee on each additional charge over, even if it was 1 cent. Unethical practices. The only good things were that it is easy to open a new account online and there are plenty of Bank of America ATMs and locations. I switched my checking to a credit union and I am a happier customer.","1462":"For the last four years, I have been banking at Bank of America. Having an account at Bank of America, has been by far the best banking experience I've ever had. Occasionally I'll be surprised by some small fee, but that's only if my balance runs too low. My checking account is free, as long as there is a $100 balance. My favorite thing about banking with Bank of America is being able to deposit my checks directly into the ATM. I don't have to wait on line for a teller, and then wait some more for him\/her to process my transaction. If you are unhappy with your current banking experience, then I recommend banking with Bank of America.","1461":"I would definitely recommend Bank of America for opening a savings account. The fees are minimal and they won't stick you with undisclosed, random fees. Probably one of the biggest positives about Bank of America is the frequency I see their ATMs wherever I go. If I ever go out of town for a vacation or business trip, there\u2019s always a Bank of America ATM on the corner. The only thing I would warn against is using other ATMs. Because there are so many Bank of America ATMs they charge a small fee when using ATMs from other banks or credit unions.","266":"I have been a customer of Bank of America for quite a few years now. I began with them right out of school when I needed my first bank account for putting my paycheck in to. One thing I haven't been pleased with is all of the fees that they have. I have had my fair share of them and I can tell you first-hand that they are not fun and I have not once been able to get one removed from my account. It's hardly fair. On the other hand, they have great customer service, aside from when you're trying to deal with fees. For issues that don't involve them giving you money back they go above and beyond what most people expect from their banks. That's probably the only reason I'm still with them after all these years.","1469":"Having had a very bad experience with Bank of America through their credit card department, I was not very happy when I found out that my mortgage had been bought by them. Number one, I was very hesitant to set up payments with them and, number two, we had not had very good experiences talking to customer service before. When I called to set up out automatic payments, the agent on the other line was very nice and knowledgeable. The agent assured me that they would draft the payments on the day I set up and if it was different to just call them. The process to set up automatic payments was not hard but a little time consuming. I have had to call into the mortgages department several times in the three years they have been servicing our loan and each time I have been impressed with the service I got. The mortgage department has definitely saved their reputation with me.","1468":"I have been using Bank of America since I needed a bank account when I got my first job 8 years ago. Although I have had a few issues over the years (overdrafts that shouldn't have happened, having my card locked while traveling) customer service has always been prompt and helpful. In fact, when my debit card was stolen, the customer service representative went out of his way to help me cancel the card, and helped me learn how to write a check so that I still had access to my account while I waited for a new debit card to be sent. I currently have a checking account, a savings account, and a credit card with Bank of America. I plan to use Bank of America for years to come.","1467":"$100 initial bonus. That's nice! This is the only credit card I'm using now. Since I have account in BOA, its easy for me to pay the credit card online. Just a few clicks and done. Besides, the 1% cash back on everything is great. The most important thing is that there is a cash back program in this card and you can access them online. I mean that after you login in your account, you will see the shops with extra cash back if you use this card shopping. For example, the body shop, 10% cash back. You can find a lot shops. And you can also access the website with your mobile device. I use my phone sometimes to pay this credit card. Its convenient.","1466":"I've had a wonderful experience with Bank of America. I used to use them for cashing my work checks, and even the day I went in wearing my sweats, they were very courteous and professional. When I needed to change banks, I joined Bank of America. Though the process took longer than it should and the associate who set up my account forgot to disclose information about how to get my bonus for joining, it was generally easy-going. Every issue has been met with wonderful customer service and a real explanation of fees and their application. I'm very satisfied.","1465":"Bank of America has been my bank for almost a year and I love them. I really enjoy the ease of use with the ATM machines. The tellers are also always very friendly. Anytime I have had a problem with my account, they explain it in depth and help me fix it in a timely manner. I also enjoy how simple it is to use their mobile application. I use it almost every day to check balances, deposit checks, and many other things. Their \"Keep the Change\" program is awesome. It is a great way to help me save my money. I really love it because I barely notice the money going out of the checking and before I know it, I have a significant amount in my savings. It\u2019s pretty great! I really love this bank!","267":"I was with Bank of America for a few years. Out of the many banks I have dealt with, they have been an ok bank to be a customer of. The customer service was usually pretty good and all the employees were very friendly. The one thing that I wasn't a fan of was that it seemed like they had a lot of fees for this and that. Even paying my bill a certain way, it seemed like they would get you with a fee. Although, Bank of America wasn\u2019t my favorite bank, there are banks that are a lot worse than them! All in all they were ok to deal with.","1464":"I have been using this card for many years now. This was actually the first card that I ever applied for and received. I signed up for this card in my sophomore year. One day when they had a table set up near the computer lab at my college. The process was quick and easy, and I was instantly approved. The rates were very low, and I have never had a problem with the card. One of the best features of the card is the Safe Shop feature. This feature allows you to create a temporary credit card number with it's own limit to use online. This has come in handy more than once when I was going to use a website that I did not want to give my actual credit card number to. This is a great first card, I recommend it to any college student looking to build credit.","268":"I have been banking with Bank of America since 2007 and have had almost entirely positive experiences with them. Previously I was with Washington Mutual, but decided to merge accounts. The few times I have had issues with Bank of America, they were quickly resolved over the phone through the customer service hotline. I frequently travel and am outside the United States. My biggest problem with the bank is the operating hours of the call centers. For people like me, it can be very difficult to get in contact with them considering the time zones. For most people this is not going to be an issue, however, as most of their customers are usually calling from within the United States. All in all, I am quite pleased to be a Bank of America customer when it comes to my checking account. The online banking features, customer service and overall ease of use make for an easy and simple way to run a checking account.","264":"I only have one credit card, which is BoA's cash reward card. I'm an international student and I firstly got a secured credit card from BOA. A year later, I applied for the cash rewards card and the application was successful. It only takes less than a week. The customer service of BoA is very good. They are patient and nice. I remember that I had a problem with my credit card a few months ago and the customer service spent one and half hour with me on phone and resolved the problem. What\u2019s more, the cash reward card itself is rewarding. I mean, you can get 1% cash back anywhere. No annual fee.I highly recommend BoA for their good customer service and excellent products.By the way, BoA's online banking webpage is easy to use. I feel very comfortable with their user interface. It\u2019s one of the best I have ever seen.","262":"I have been a loyal Bank of America customer for over 6 years. During that time I've opened up a checking and savings account and several CDs. Additionally, I also have a Bank of America rewards credit card. It has been extremely easy to access any information relating to my accounts from pretty much anywhere in the world. Their iPhone app is extremely convenient, and has saved me on a few occasions by allowing for immediate \"last minute\" transfers of money between accounts. While I do most of my banking via direct deposits and online, the few times I have needed to visit a branch have been quick and extremely efficient experiences. Overall, I am very happy with my Bank of America experience, enough so to convince my employer to switch their accounts to B. of A. as well!","261":"I have been a customer of this bank for a year or two and I have to say that I am not impressed. While I listened to others complain about the bank I just figured they were being naggy. The main thing I cannot stand is that the fees for everything seem so large and the customer service leaves A LOT to be desired. I don't think any issue I have has been resolved reasonably. The only reason I keep my account active is because you can find a branch almost anywhere. Apparently convenience trumps all else in the world of banking.","260":"My first checking and savings account as an adult was with Bank of America, which was Barnett Bank once upon a time. I've never had a problem that wasn't quickly and easily resolved with a call to customer service. If you're a responsible customer, they will treat you right every time. I've now been with them for fifteen years. I love having one of my main credit cards attached to my checking account so that I easily pay my bill or redeem my rewards without ever leaving the site. As a longtime preferred customer I don't have to pay to use my debit card, and this isn't because I have large funds stored in the bank.","265":"I used to be a B of A customer. I'm glad that I'm not any longer. I had nothing but trouble from them the entire time I was a customer there. There was an issue with my mortgage that involved me having to drive four hours away, on the first of every month, to make my payment in person. They took six months to figure that nonsense out before they finally let me make my payments online again. There is no physical location closer to me than that and that made them a trouble to me as well. The employees do not care about the customers or about how they are treated. I do not recommend them and I would like to say that I'm very happy with my new bank.","263":"I really like this bank. I have a student checking and savings account here and it has been wonderful. I was not sure if I would bank with them because a few people I know said they had problems with overdrafts and around the time I opened my account they were featured on the news for possible unfair banking practices and overdrafts. I went with them anyway because I felt that if you are mindful with your spending and keep your checkbooks balanced most overdrafts can be avoided. I also liked that they gave me a temporary card so my money wouldn't be tied up while I waited for the permanent card. Ebay took some money out of my account without me knowing and that made me over draft by I think $4 or $5. I put money in the account the day after unaware of what happened. When I saw that BoA took out some money I called explained the situation and they refunded me the money with no penalty. I have four checking accounts and this one is my favorite because I never have any problems with it.","269":"I was with Bank of America for about a year. If ripping people of and nickel and diming your customers over petty, unnecessary charges is the American way, then this Bank definitely earns its namesake. As with most banks, the application process to setup a checking and savings account was very easy. Customer service was subpar in my opinion. I'm used to waiting in phone queues, but the wait times for B of A seemed to be more treacherous than any other experiences I have had with customer services departments at different banks. When I finally did get through, B of A was horrible at resolving any issues in a timely and effective manner. I often found myself wanting to throw my phone at the ground while talking to their customer service reps. On to my next and most important point\u2026 they screw you over with fees that many other banks simply don't have. There is a $14 monthly fee for checking accounts if the average daily balance is not at least $1,500. In this tough economy, where people are struggling, who really needs that? No thanks, I'd rather stick with HSBC and avoid fees on my account and get the same exact services offered. What's that? You want to use online banking with B of A? OK, be ready to pay an $8.95 monthly service charge unless you agree to receiving only online statements AND never needing to use a teller in person for withdrawals. That's right. If you use a teller to manually withdraw any money, you will need to pay the $8.95 fee! Hopefully by now, you see where this is going.... B of A rips you off, plain and simple. Why put your hard earned money in a bank which looks to squeeze every last drop out of you when you can easily pick another bank which offers the same, if not better, services without theses additional fees? Do yourself a favor and research other options before opening an account with these fools.","974":"I know Bank of America generally gets a bad rap, but I have had only a positive experience with them. When I applied for a checking account, it was because I got divorced and my ex really screwed up our bank account. Bank of America accepted me when other banks would not because of some problems with my previous account. I received my checks and debit card in a timely manner. I am using the 100% online checking account, which means all my banking is done online or at an ATM and I am not using tellers. This option gives me 100% free checking. I have had no hidden fees or overdrafts. I have begun to receive cash back for using my debit card at places I normally shop anyway, such as Redbox and restaurants. Overall, I am very happy with my Bank of America checking account.","975":"My husband and I have been with Bank of America for over two years now. When we refinanced our house, our mortgage was purchased by Bank of America. This financial institution was not our choice. We had our mortgage with Wells Fargo Bank when we first bought our house in 2008, and we were very happy with them. Bank of America has taken every opportunity to nickel and dime us. For instance, they charge us to make payments online, and they charge us a $10 fee to pay over the phone. It is difficult to work with the customer service representatives because not all of them know what they are doing. One positive aspect of Bank of America is they will work with people if they do fall behind on the mortgage. Overall, this is not the best bank to take a mortgage for you house from.","972":"Bank of America has been excellent for me. I knew I was making a wise decision when signing up for this Bank. I've found their ATM machines in various places so I don't have to pay any fines when accessing other ATMs. Additionally, whenever I am in need of assistance, making a deposit or opening a new account, I\u2019ve always found Bank of America employees to be exceptionally professional, well mannered and ready to serve. I\u2019ve never spent a long time waiting in line and have never left disappointed with the services they have. Online banking also makes my life much easier, and it is recommended that you take full advantage of that service. I feel proud to participate in a bank with a more modernized approach to banking and will do anything to meet my requirements as a customer.","970":"I currently bank with Bank of America and have had them since 2005. I wouldn't keep Bank of America so long if they weren't good but I will say that I've had my fair share of issues with this bank. The first thing that bothers me is putting my check on hold. I recently went inside the bank to cash my check on a Friday. I had the check I had received from work and was told that I would have to pay $8.95 because I don't have direct deposit or I can waive the fee and cash it at the ATM. That is really stupid. I come inside the bank because I like the whole experience and they simply ruined that. Another issue is that I get paid a weekly salary plus commission. My checks vary every week and my office doesn't offer direct deposit. I had paid the $8.95 to cash my check and after she had given me a little cash back from that check and the deposit slip said hold on account. I had asked her what that was about and was told she didn't know I would have to call someone at customer service. There was a big problem with that since my rent would be coming out first thing Sat. morning. Eventually after having to be a little ugly to the customer service manager I was able to get the hold removed. I know this review sounds bad but Bank of America is a really good bank and offer a lot of great services. The only thing I would say is they should close a little bit later on Saturdays. I would recommend Bank of America to any of my friends, but beware if your pay checks are for different amounts each week. They may put a 3 day hold on it.","976":"Let's see\u2026 I used Bank of America to pick up a loan awhile back. I actually really liked going through Bank of America for many reasons. They were extremely helpful in their services and there were no hidden charges and glitches to the loan. The banker was very clear and extremely helpful, not to mention personable and kind as well. My loan was easy to pay off and the interest was fairly low so it wasn't too bad in the wallet. I would use Bank of America again for another loan. They seem like an honest bank for the most part, which is difficult to find these days.","977":"I have been a Bank of America Customer since I was in high school. That is more than fifteen years ago. I have remained with them and been a loyal customer with both a personal checking account and a savings account. They have always been fair and honest in all their dealings. It is nice to have a bank where you know that you can count on and that they can deliver on their promises. They are the type of bank where you can set up an account at and then forget about any hassles or extra calls to complain about charges, fees or any other issues that may arise from other banks.","978":"The Susan G. Komen Visa card is average and suits my basic needs. The interest rate is not the best, but it is acceptable for a card that approves people with some credit blemishes. The cash back rewards feature is nice, as it rewards you for purchases you make on a daily basis anyway, such as gas and groceries. If you use your card a lot, the cash back rewards will add up fast. An added bonus is that Bank of America will donate a portion to the Susan G. Komen foundation. Overall I am happy enough with this card and have no complaints.","979":"I have had a bank account with Bank of America for a little over a year. I do my depositing in the drive-thru ATM lane. Almost every time I make a deposit, it disperses some of my money back. It won't accept some of the bills that may be bent a little or have a tiny tear. Yet when you use their ATM to take money out they give you those bills! Otherwise, I have had no issues with this bank and actually enjoy banking here. I may just start depositing inside to save me the problem! I would recommend this bank to any of my family or friends!","973":"I have been very happy with my service at Bank of America so far. Every time I have used this bank, even before I was a customer there, they have always been very helpful and willing to work with me when other banks weren't, and that's what drew me to their service. I have had no bad experiences so far and have only had very friendly and willing encounters with everyone I have dealt with. They are willing to sit down and explain everything to me so that I understand it. I had not had a bank account before signing up here, and so they helped me along the way in order to figure out all the little details.","971":"I recently started using my Bank of America American Express about two years ago. The best part about this card is that you can see the account (along with your checking and savings accounts) when you log into BoA's web site. This makes it very simple to pay off. You can simply transfer money from either type account to the credit card account and it is paid immediately. I only use this credit card once every two or three months, for big purchases such as vacations, car repairs and other unforeseen expenses. So far, this has worked out great. I am saving up my accelerated awards points for a trip at the end of the summer. With the points I am planning on purchasing either a hotel room or towards the cost of a plane ticket.","340":"Bank of America was where I had my first bank account ever. Since I was a little boy, my parents took me to Bank of America for all of my financial needs. Of course, back when I was younger 25 dollars in my savings account was a pretty big deal. However, nowadays the service provided and services offered are just as, if not even more so, impressive! Bank of America offers a clean cut solution for almost any need, be it checking, savings, combined, credit, or any other sort of account. They are always looking for ways to help me, and always are polite and respectful. Highly recommended!","343":"When I turned 18 and was employed for the first time, my first ever bank account was with Bank of America. The application process was quick, easy, and painless. But everything else was the complete opposite. It seemed that a \u201cfailed direct deposit\u201d was a regular occurrence. Plus every now and then my debit card just wouldn't work. I tried to get a logical explanation from someone as to why this was happening. But unfortunately nobody could provide me with one. Eventually I decided to do my banking somewhere else which was a good move for me. I know people who use Bank of America and have no problems at all. But as I said before, that wasn't the case for me.","341":"I opened a checking account with Bank of America about 2 years ago and was really impressed at first, but then I began having issues with their overdraft policy. It seemed like certain deposits would be delayed until other payments were withdrawn, resulting in an overdraft more often than I thought should have occurred. I did like they had many ATM booths making it easy to perform transactions anywhere I went, but it seems that, lately, there are less than I remember. Overall, I do receive friendly service when I visit my local branch and have learned to be more watchful over my account to avoid overdraft fees.","3509":"Almost No Problems Over 33 Years I have had a relationship with BofA since April, 1979, and have had almost no issues with them. \u00a0In California the convenience of their branch and ATM network is unbeatable.\u00a0","347":"Several years ago, something happened that led me to know I would be a Bank of America customer for life. My parents had planned a trip to Hawaii to celebrate their 30th anniversary, and my dad's 50th birthday was also very close to this date. For over one year, I and my brothers had made arrangements to surprise my dad on his 50th by the whole family showing up in Hawaii to celebrate with him. This was a very big deal to us, a once in a lifetime event to spend this time together on a magical trip. We each saved and planned for over a year to make this happen. Four months before the trip, it was time to buy the airline tickets. My brothers gave me their money and I proceeded to buy the airline tickets for them and myself through my BoA checking account. A short time later, the unthinkable happened, the airline I purchased the tickets through went bankrupt. My tickets were no longer valid and the airline was not responding. Nearly $2500 was gone. I was in a panic. I called BoA and explained the situation and tried to dispute the charge for services not rendered. BoA took care of it. They reversed the charge from my account and it stood. Their guarantee was a life saver. That was and still is a lot of money. I will never forget that BoA took care of me in this way. If it were any other bank, I'm not so sure they'd have done the same. So, that is why I am a BoA customer for life.","344":"Banking at Bank of America has been a complete joy! I have a checking and savings account with them. I normally do my banking online but most of the time, I go down to the bank itself when there is something I cannot do online.The people who work at the branch I go to are absolutely kind and very understanding. I had to go down one day to make a deposit for my mother. I used the ATM and all the money went through except one bill. It was a $100 and I kept trying to put it through the ATM, but it would just not take it. So I went inside and spoke to a banker. It turns out that that bill was counterfeit! I was so worried that she would accuse me of making a counterfeit bill, but she calmed my nerves.She just told me that she would need to take the bill and fill out paperwork. All I had to do was sign the paperwork and the banker would give me a copy just in case I needed to show it to my mother. She could give it to her boss in order to reimburse her for the counterfeit bill.I, personally, never had any problems with Bank of America. Whenever I needed help or advice, the people who work for the company were understanding and were willing to work with me. I will always continue to bank with Bank of America.","345":"I had lived in Charlotte, NC for 13 years where BoA dominates but did not start banking with them until 2003 when they bought out Fleet. I was excited because that meant seamless money transfers between my family members.Almost all of my banking is done online and at the ATM so I love that they make it super convenient. This helps me to stay even though I have serious issues like never receiving disclosure letters about changes in their fees which has tripped me up a few times since I'm on a very tight budget.And even though I've been getting the same monthly deposit on the 3rd Wednesday of every month for almost 2 years, they charged $12 because the deposit came 1 day after what seemed like a shortened statement period and refused to refund it. The rep at the branch changed my account to an eAccount meaning I can't use the teller at all, in order to avoid a monthly fee. So, basically, they are using my money for almost nothing in return.I've also closed my savings account with them because I could not save enough money per month without it getting eaten up by the fees. Though I should say ATTEMPTED to close the savings account because I've called customer service 3x and gone into my local branch 2x yet still receive a printed monthly statement in the mail almost a year later (even though I chose the paperless option online when I still had the account)I am also having serious issues with their ethical behavior in terms of their role in the mortgage crisis, their political influence and interest rate manipulation. At this point, I've already researched my credit union and community bank options and one more bad experience or incidence of money grubbing will trump convenience and make me switch.","346":"I have been banking with Bank of America for about six years now. I came to them after a bad experience with Chase. Thankfully, Bank of America has never let me down. Opening an account with them is quick and painless. I opened my account online and was able to complete it within a few minutes and had it approved the very next day. I received my card about five days later. Customer service is always really helpful and fair. They answer all of my questions really well and actually make an effort to listen to me and make things right. I lost my card once and they were quick to cancel the card and issue me a temporary card while I waited for my new card to come in the mail. Overall, I am really pleased with this bank and recommend them to anyone who is looking for a good trustworthy bank.","348":"I love the fact that Bank of America is so \u201cprolific\u201d and no matter what town or city I go into I am almost guaranteed to find one of their ATM machines. I don't like their $35 dollar overdraft fees. I love their website and the email reminders that they send me. I love their android app too. I especially love their new feature that allows you to literally just take a picture of your check and it's instantly deposited into your bank. Extremely neat and extremely convenient! I only give them 4 out of 5 mostly because of their overdraft fees.","342":"Bank of America has been my bank of choice for over 5 years now. They provide great support, and are always available to resolve any issue you have. Financial difficulty? They will work with you through it. I highly recommend Bank of America to anyone. Plus you have the convenience of ATMs and banking centers in almost every state in the USA. I currently have the following with Bank of America: personal checking, small business checking, credit card and savings.The application process for of the above stated accounts was easy, and can be completed online. Also as an added benefit check out BankAmeriDeals. 5 *****","2045":"This card might not be the best card I have ever had, but it is certainly for a good cause. It donates some of the profits to the Susan G. Komen foundation, which is a very big and well-respected cancer charity. I am pleased to know that the card is helping a good cause, but aside from that the card is more or less average. It gives you the standard 1% back on most purchases, but gas will get you 3% back, and groceries receive 2%. The rate for gas and groceries is good, and I have no reason to complain. You can get a 100 dollar bonus when you sign up, and that is great! Overall this is a good card, but it is not anything amazing.","2044":"I have been a Bank of America Visa card user for over a year now and I can tell you that the cash back options are great. I have received rewards back from fast food restaurants, gasoline purchases and even going to the grocery store! They are top of the line. I have to save every where I can to make ends meet sometimes and using this card is the way to add additional 3% back on these purchases. I would recommend this card to everyone, try it; you can't lose a dime and you might end of surprising yourself and start saving even more.","2043":"Bank of America is absolutely the best bank out there. The customer service is top-notch. Whenever I need to make a deposit, or anything of that sort, I am in and out within seconds. They can answer any and all questions, and not to mention their credit cards are great. I have been with Bank of America for quite some time now, but recently I got my own student card. I use it to purchase books and pay for any other school related fees. The card is amazing, and they really help us students out with the low monthly fees. If you are not with Bank of America, I suggest you switch ASAP! You will not regret it, I can assure you that. Make the switch I am telling you!","2042":"In my experience, rewards cards can be very hit and miss. Sometimes you even have to deal with higher APR's than normal due the amount of rewards you are getting back. Not the case with this BankAmericard Power Rewards card. I was extremely impressed with the 0% introductory rate, as well as more reasonable than I expected reward options. I found myself constantly using this card on gas purchases, even changing my regular gas station to make sure I went to one that took Visa credit. This card was a big win for me, and my credit wasn't even perfect. Look here if you want a safe, reliable card from a reputable institution that pays you back and then some.","349":"I have been a Bank of America customer for the past four years. I have several accounts with them \u2013 checking, savings, and a custodial savings account for my son. Bank of America tends to have a bad reputation with the general public but I have had no problems with them. There are no fees attached to my checking account, and I linked one of my Bank of America savings accounts to my checking account to prevent any overdraft charges. I have always received excellent customer service from the representatives. Before I linked the accounts, I accidentally overdrafted my checking account and the bank reimbursed me for all of the overdraft charges. The bank's website is user-friendly, and I use the bank's app on my smartphone quite frequently. Overall, Bank of America is a solid financial institution and I've had a great experience with them.","2040":"I received my Alaska Airlines Visa Signature card just after I moved back from Alaska. When I first received it I was given a bunch of miles to sign up, however it was attached to an agreement to pay a fee each year for use. The perks are nice and include things like opportunities for extra mile earning, a companion fair for $80, and opportunity to use the miles with other carriers. The negative aspects of the card include increases in yearly fee, potential expiration of miles, and increases in the amount of miles required for a airline flight. This card can certainly be beneficial if you have enough spending to balance out the annual fee or travel a lot (especially with Alaska).","2041":"I have used bank of America and have overall been satisfied with my experiences. Their customer service is great and most of the time if you have any problems they are resolved in a quick and timely manner. The only complaint I have is that there has been just a few unexpected transfer fees and such. Nothing that was too huge, but still kind of annoying. The branches are set up very nice and there's always one close by to grab cash or make transactions. Sometimes there is a little bit of a line, but nothing too bad. I will definitely keep using this bank in the future.","2046":"My bank is Bank of America. I have been with them for six years and have nothing but positive things to say about them. I am always greeted by friendly tellers which brighten my day up. They don\u2019t have any outrageous overdraft fees, in fact they have overdraft protection which has saved my butt many times. They have ATMS located everywhere and I can always find one when I need to withdraw money. Their ATMS also feature a check and cash deposit system for when the bank isn\u2019t open. This makes it super convenient to bank with them. Bank of America is a great bank and I would highly recommend them to anyone!","2047":"I was a customer of Bank of America for a short period of time. While applying for an account and being accepted as a member was quick and relatively simple, actually being a member of this bank was a dreadful experience. There seemed to be every possible problem on a regular basis. From debits taking too many days to process, failed direct deposits resulting in bank fees, dropped payment attempts with bill pay to useless customer service...everything at this bank is an issue. One of my biggest fears is that my mortgage will one day, somehow, get sold to Bank of America. I think I'd cry. I would not recommend this bank to anyone, as a credit union, savings and loan or any other financial product. That is, unless you enjoy learning the hard way.","940":"I used to have a checking account with Bank of America. This bank from my experience is absolutely dreadful. The tellers are more like sales people. Every time I would go into a location and try to either deposit or withdraw funds, the teller would always be trying to sign me up for a service I did not need. There were two occasions, where the bank overdrew my account, and I was forced to pay a $30 overdraft fee, for a mistake the bank made. The second time the bank made a mistake, they charged me twice for one purchase I made effectively overdrawing my account again, and they tried to get me to pay an overdraft fee yet again. After the second mess up, I closed my accounts with bank of America. You are better off going to a local credit union. Stay away from BoA, they only care about their profits.","941":"I have used Bank of America for over 10 years and so far I have a positive relationship with them. I never had any problems with them actually. Although I may have had some issues with some sort of fees in the past, they were easily fixed with great customer service and great communication and they also assisted me in saving as much money possible. I plan to use them for years to come and will also open a business account with them because in my experience it has better customer service, benefits and many other option that their competitors lack.","942":"I was a customer of Bank of America in the past and they were okay in the beginning until they started charging me outrageous fees. I went to try and close the account and they would not give up and kept giving me a hard time. My husband had an account with them now and has had one for the past 5 years I believe. He has had no issues up until now when they started charging him a 12 dollar monthly maintenance fee. He will be closing the account in the next couple of days. I have heard many bad things about this bank and I would not recommend them to anyone. I think back in the day, their banking was pretty good, but they have changed so much.","943":"Bank of America is not for those faint of heart. It was not unusual for me to find myself frustrated constantly over failure of customer service addressing my issues in a timely manner. Setting up things like direct deposit was more painful than it should have been. With that said, once you get everything in order with BoA, the banking process itself goes pretty smoothly. The online interface is not best in class but professional and robust like you would expect from a large bank. Automatic bill pay was also a breeze to use. But none of these conveniences compare to the fact my closest Bank of America branch has a drive up ATM which I used constantly. I wouldn't rush to choose Bank of America over some of the other top banking institutions, but if it makes more sense for you to use them, go for it.","944":"I have had a Bank of America Checking account for nearly 10 years. They have been pretty decent during that time; but there are things from time to time where you just know you are dealing with a huge national bank and it would be nice to have a smaller, local firm to work with.I've stuck with them for a silly reason, really. They have my home mortgage, and so it is super simple to pay my monthly payment; as easy as an online account transfer. As easy as online bill-pay is with most banks now \u2013 that is probably an illogical reason to stick with a bank that you're not totally satisfied with, but there is a certain peace of mind that comes with not having to worry whether the money made it there or not.We did have some fraud issues a while back and they were very helpful and quickly resolved the issues and refunded all the money after we had filed the appropriate paperwork.I guess my big beef is just their fee structure. It seems like they keep finding ways to charge me money for the pleasure of keeping it with them. I suppose I'll look into a local small bank or credit union soon.","2049":"I have been using them for about the last 8 years. They have handled my checking account with a direct deposit for 5 of those years. My experience has also been very satisfactory; however, if I do need to call the 800 number for customer service, there is always an extensive wait time and transfer to this department and that department before I get to the department I originally called for! Fees are not out of the ordinary for this bank compared to any other bank. If you don't write bad checks, they don't charge you. It\u2019s as simple as that. Overall, it is a very good financial institution to do business with. They have online and mobile access so that you can look at your account and see what transactions have taken place immediately. Nice!!","2048":"I've been a customer of Bank of America for approximately 8 years, after they purchased my mortgage from a different mortgage company. I wasn't pleased when my loan was first sold to them as I spent a great deal of time being transferred from one department\/person to another. Over the years I have requested many times to stop paper communication, and every time the representative states it will be taken care of, but last week I received a paper statement again. At the beginning of November 2012 I contacted Bank of America and spoke with two different people regarding an early payment I made, and was told there was no record of the payment and the confirmation number I had wouldn't help them. 3 days later I received a letter in the mail stating they attempted to contact me to confirm that I wanted to make an extra payment, but cancelled it because they couldn't reach me. It's frustrating dealing with a company that doesn't train their reps on where\/how to look for information. I do enjoy their website though. It is user friendly. It is easy to find information and it appears to be up-to-date. Since I don\u2019t want to refinance my mortgage I'll stick it out and hopefully continue to be able to communicate with Bank of America strictly on their website.","948":"The cash back option on this Bank of America credit card is top notch. I\u2019ve had this card for a few years, and I have enjoyed the returns I get for using it. Basically, it discounts everything you purchase one percent, which adds up when you\u2019re a penny pincher like I am. But it is even better to buy groceries with\u2014I offer to do all the grocery shopping for my apartment because of the two percent cash back. But the best part, by far, is the extra bonus you receive if you deposit the money directly into your Bank of America account. Ten percent bonus on top of the discounts is pretty awesome. I\u2019d recommend this card, especially if you are currently a Bank of America account holder.","945":"My Bank of America credit card was a replacement for a citi card that I used for years. I got it for the good introductory rate and fees. The card services however were a nightmare and quite frustrating. The customer service reps are usually unable to be understood due to poor language skills, or they are so disconnected from what they're doing to give a care. After the introductory rate the rates and fees skyrocket without notice. The good thing about the card is that it opens up offers for better cards that I'd advise everyone to take advantage of.","946":"My Bank of America credit card was a replacement for a citicard due to the good introductory rate and the convenience of me having my checking there. Unfortunately, that is where the benefits end. First off, the card services are a joke. They are either unable to be understood or have no idea how to help you. If the latter is the case they transfer the call to someone that has no more experience and is usually less qualified. The best thing about the card was that it allowed me t qualify for better cards after having it for a while. I quickly jumped ship and don't regret it.","947":"This was my first credit card and one that's still in my wallet today. It's a very simple and straight forward card, no hidden fees, no surprises, just a reliable credit card. The Bank Of America customer service team is helpful and efficient and their online services are easy to use. The only problems I've ever encountered is a lag in payments posting using the online system. This has occasionally caused problems and required me to call the customer service team to sort it out so I would urge you to pay attention to the deadlines for processing times.The only problem I have is it seems to be overly sensitive to credit card fraud. Legitimate payments are routinely halted and frozen until I approve them. I appreciate them being diligent about fraud but this service has caused more problems with legitimate authorizations and failed to spot the actual fraudulent charges. A definite annoyance but overall I'm still a happy customer.","949":"I\u2019ve been with Bank of America for about 2 years now at the beginning of my college freshman year. I opened both a checking and savings account as a full-time student and all I needed to do was deposit $50 into the savings to start off. Not too shabby. Not only that but I do not have to pay any monthly bills to keep the account either; I just have to turn on paperless statements. I prefer checking it online rather than getting physical mail anyways. I was able to get a debit card with any picture or background of my choice and a free check book! The ATM machines are plentiful around the city and they have yet to fail me. That\u2019s also very convenient. I never have to go to a bank teller, the machines are always available. Another feature I like is the fact that BoA will email or text me when my account balance drops below $25.00. That is very useful in keeping track of my bills and balance. The Cash Back Reward system is also great, for each transaction, BoA will deduct some of it into your savings as free change.I am very satisfied with being a BoA customer. The start up process was very simple and it is great for any college student beginning to learn about their finances and savings. The representatives are also polite, professional, and easy to talk to in case any assistance is required.","2260":"I am extremely satisfied with Bank of America. I opened up an online checking account on my computer within five minutes. Within a few days I received sample checks and a welcome letter with all of my account information. Since I signed up for the online banking only, I can only deposit and withdraw money from an ATM machine. If I use a teller I am charged a fee. However, I have never needed a teller, so my online banking has been completely free of charge! It is so easy to put my checks and cash into the Bank of America ATM machines! I can also take a picture of my checks and deposit them using my smart phone! I have a text alert set up with my account so that I receive a text when my account balance goes below $25.00. In addition, I have a BOA app downloaded on my phone where I can access my account anytime I want. It also shows me the closest BOA locations with ATM machines where I can deposit or withdraw money free of charge! I would highly recommend Bank of Americas free online checking for easy, quick deposits and withdraws.I am also very satisfied with BoA's customer service. A representative contacted me informing me of potential fraudulent activity on my account due to an email I opened that was pretending to be from Bank of America. They placed a hold on my account, gave me a new password and an anti-virus that could assist me in detecting hazardous emails. The man was very personable, polite and easy to talk to. He made me feel very secure and that my money was safe with BOA.","2262":"Frankly I am pretty disappointed with this bank. I have always heard good things until I went and saw how they do things first hand. I can\u2019t lie when I went and opened up an account the bank manger was real polite, everyone was real courteous and I felt pretty confident opening a checking account with them, so in fact I did. The moment I walked out their door everything changed. I ended up trying to transfer some money from PayPal into my account and at first it went through from PayPal\u2019s end but then, on Bank of America's part, they told me it was declined, that I couldn\u2019t transfer money from that type of account and so it would be returned. After a week of waiting for my returned money I never got it and so I called their main office and they told me that they decided they could do the transaction after all, but they charged for a transfer fee and an account maintenance fee for two months, even though I had only had my account for only a little over a week. So all the money I transferred got took from them and it was close to 20 bucks. Then I went to close my account and also got screwed out of the money I had used to open the account with, which was 25 dollars. So yeah, overall Bank of America is a scamming business and they will rip you off!!!","2261":"I've been with Bank of America for over 4 years now and I've never had any problems with them. If I'm getting close to my minimum balance, I get an alert every time so that I can avoid any fees. Also, they don't give you a fee every time you charge your card over your minimum balance. They do it once after a few transactions and they let you get away with a few more transactions before they send you another alert.I've had a few of these in the past because of financial problems but once I got back on my feet and paid off the debt, my credit score wasn't affected by much. This was all with my debit card.Not long ago applied for their cash back rewards credit card and have had it for the past 8 months or so. I'm really happy with it because I got $100 back when I spent $500 in the first month on a train ticket. And I keep getting money back for regular transactions such as groceries and gas. Also, I get no permanent interest until a full year later, which is great because if I do make a cash advance, I pay low interest until I pay off the full balance amount. Moreover, instead of having to end the card and apply for a new credit card, BoA just adds another full original balance amount to my credit card with no interest on it. As long as you use the credit card for purchases, you get money back and no interest ($100 back!!!), which is great for college students looking to build credit and keep their finances in check.","1882":"I have been a Bank of America customer for about 2 years. I am satisfied with the company. At first, I had a regular personal checking account. Then, I switched to the online\/ATM only account because I no longer had direct deposit so I could avoid fees. This means that as long as I conduct all of my business online, on the phone or via ATM, I don't pay any checking account fees. However, I wish they had straight \u201cfree checking\u201d like some other banks. I\u2019ve chosen Bank of America over other banks because they have so many locations and ATMs available so that makes it convenient to do business with them. They offer good promotions. I am a member of the Keep the Change program whereby every time I make a purchase, the \u201cchange\u201d goes into my savings account and my savings account grows that way. They had a program whereby they would match whatever I put in but I still have not received my \u201cmatch\u201d from them. They can be slow in fulfilling their promises in that way. However, whenever I have had a dispute with a merchant, they have promptly refunded my account and assisted in the situation. I opened my account online so it is easy to open an account with them. Every time I have visited a branch or emailed or called them, their associates are always kind, friendly, polite and helpful. They have a free VISA check card with their checking accounts which is great because VISA is accepted everywhere and I can shop just like having a credit card. Their online banking website is secure and easy to use. All in all, I would recommend this bank.","1881":"My wife and I have been Bank of America members probably since 2005. We love them. I have heard a lot of people speak negatively about them, and telling us about the problems they have had. However, we have never had an issue. My wife recently had her debit card stolen, and a ton of charges racked up on it. BoA was swift and appropriate in their handling of the case. Even though it was her checking account, and it was severely in the negative, they allowed her to spend her money as usual until the claim was processed. We both have checking, savings, debit, and credit through BoA. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a new bank. I like that they have good weekend hours that a lot of banks don't have. They have a great iPhone app to manage accounts, deposit checks via a picture taking program, and transfer money around. I always get friendly customer service in person, and I like that the new banks are getting away from the glass walls between you and the tellers, as it seems more personal now.","1880":"When I set up my small business 2 years ago and required banking support, I first looked into going with Bank of America rather than my local credit union (which we used for personal banking), as the impression was that for business purposes it was always best to go with a big bank. Unfortunately, they made it quite clear early on that small business is of no interest to them. My online application was held up for weeks as they could not physically comprehend that someone here as a legal resident would want to set up their own business. E-mailed documentations were lost, I had to speak to a different person each time and no details ever seemed to have been saved on their computers when I called. The worst part was that each time it just seemed like the person I was speaking to didn't care and I was just another annoyance to deal with before getting out the door at 5pm. I gave up in the end and used the Credit Union and have had no problems.","2269":"I have been banking with Bank of America for over 5 years, and I have never had any serious issues. It is far better than my previous bank, where I constantly suffered from online banking issues and poor customer service. Bank of America has been amazing to bank with. Their online banking is always fast, up to date, and very reliable. In the few times when I had a problem and had to call customer service, they are fast, friendly, and eager to help. Normally any problems were resolved efficiently and immediately. They are always finding new ways to enhance the banking experience, most recently with the cash back awards in conjunction with a debit card. The application process for my checking account was quick and painless, and I was set up and ready to go almost immediately. I would highly suggest Bank of America to anyone who is looking for a new banking experience!","2268":"I have been using Bank of America for my small business account for the past 5 years, and overall I am very satisfied. The staff is friendly and fast, and they take care of all my banking needs within a timely manner. Being with Bank of America is extremely convenient, as they have branch locations throughout the US, so no matter where I am I can access my accounts. My biggest complaint with them is the service fee that is charged monthly on my account, which is $14. It may not sound like much, but a year's worth of fee's equals out to $168. I've talked to them on several occasions, but never got the fee removed. However, because of the convenience and friendly staff, I am willing to stay with Bank of America as they continue to meet my needs.","2263":"I have been with Bank of America for over 5 years. Their online banking is so simple and easy to use. Their online billing is easy to use and has all the companies I use listed, making payment a breeze. When my account is running low on funds, Bank of America actually sends out a text warning and instead of charging when the balance is too low, it actually pulls from my savings. This allows me not to get charged overdraft fees which is great. The ability to take a picture of checks and have them added to my account is a great feature, along with instant money transfers. Customer service is unparalleled, with online chatting reps who are incredibly helpful. I highly recommend Bank of America, as it cannot be beat.","2264":"Bank of America has a very friendly staff at most locations that I have visited, with their online support being just as friendly. Though I don't agree with their fees and policies I continue being a faithful customer because I've never had any hidden charges during any transaction and I've never had an issue so far with my student CD account, my checking, and savings. Soon I'll apply for a credit card. The application process was very simple and the staff made it even simpler to make sure I didn't omit any data to make it take forever to process. :)","2265":"I have had a checking account with Bank of America for over four years. I have had absolutely no problems. They do not charge me for having a low balance, I am able to get cashier\u2019s checks for free, and I can transfer money between other Bank of America accounts for free. One issue is that every time I go to a branch the line is super long, but I guess that just means they have so many customers because they are great!","2266":"I have told so many people before that if they are looking for a bank, Bank of America is the one to be a member of. Bank of America has been my bank for over 5 years. They have never charged me a fee that I did not know about beforehand, and they have always responded to my questions promptly and courteously. I love Bank of America. Also, if you send money across to other countries, like for instance, I send money to my husband's family in Mexico, Bank of America lets you send money freely to their account with little to no fees depending on how much you are sending. I would never switch banks nor do I have anything bad to say about Bank of America.","2267":"My girlfriend and I purchased a house, and as anyone could guess this bank bought the mortgage. Not only have we found out that they impose a fee you if you don't make deposits every single month, but they also ask you literally 20 different times to verify who you are when you try to make one, single transaction online. Today, for example I tried to extract the excess money that was left over in my account (because we pay a small amount over the monthly mortgage cost each month) and transfer it out of their account and into my main bank account. I was asked for my user id, password, city that I was born, they forced me to regurgitate the security code that they sent to my email, then they made me enter not only the card number on the front of the check card, but the security code on the back, and then after all of this, I ended up having to funnel the money over to my credit card at my other bank through BoA's bill pay option just to get my stinking money back. Their nickle and dimming practices are borderline illegal.","3510":"Screws Up People's Financials At Free Will My family and I have been Bank of America customers for a very long time.\u00a0 I opened my first checking account with them almost 13 years ago.\u00a0 There have been a couple of things they have done that have frustrated me, but none like the one that happened a week or so ago.\u00a0 While out shopping, I left my checkbook at one of the stores.\u00a0 After getting home and retracing my steps, I called the store and they said they had it.\u00a0 They did say they called the bank to see if they had a way of getting in touch with me as I was not in the phone book.\u00a0 I told them the bank had NOT contacted me but that was okay I was on my way to pick up the check book.\u00a0 Keep in mind no one had stolen it or run off with it so there was no threat of someone using my checks or DL.\u00a0 It wasn't until a week later that my hairdresser (thank goodness it was her) texted me asking me if everything was okay because my check to her was returned stamped \"stop payment!\"\u00a0 I felt really embarrassed because I didn't no what the heck was going on.\u00a0 I told her everything was just fine and that I had money to cover her check.\u00a0 Now to the climax of the ordeal - when I called Bank of America's customer service, and spoke to Alex, he said a stop payment had been placed on a certain check range.\u00a0 I was livid - more than livid.\u00a0 I told him that was not correct and I did NOT authorize it.\u00a0 He asked if I knew a Kathleen and I said no (who later turned out to the more believable store manager).\u00a0 He said he would cancel it immediately.\u00a0 I was so upset and worried because I had some outstanding checks - which had been cleared thank goodness!\u00a0 I hung up with him hoping it had been resolved. I called back a few minutes later to ask another question and this time spoke to Matilda.\u00a0 She said apparently the customer service person that it was me calling in!\u00a0 Did she not try to confirm it was me?\u00a0 Did she not call back or email to let me know this was done? NO NO NO!\u00a0 I told the person that the employee who placed the stop payment should be reprimanded.....he said he would make a \"notation in the file to have her coached.\"\u00a0 NO, she should be fired!!!!\u00a0 I then get a form letter in the mail saying \"as per your request....\"\u00a0 I marked on it that it was not my request and mailed it back.\u00a0 I am going this weekend to close out my savings and start the process of switching my checking to another bank - one with mostly 4 star ratings.\u00a0\u00a0 And if \/when they ask me why, I might have a hard time trying to keep my cool while deciding if I want to tell them the real reason!\u00a0","1887":"I really enjoy my Bank of America online checking account. I had a checking account with Bank of America ten years ago, and I was unimpressed with how many unnecessary fees they charged. It was a pleasant surprise when they offered the online banking option.The only possible complaint I have about the online banking account is that they really discourage coming into the bank. It is worth it, with the cost savings. Their ATM machines are user-friendly, so the average online banking customer will find that it more than suits their needs.The application process online is quick and painless. Unfortunately I went into the bank and had to wait about 20 minutes, with a squirming child, to set-up my bank account. The specialist was polite, as were the rest of the employees. I could tell that they really wanted my business. Bank of America has won my business back. The online checking account was perfect for my lifestyle and needs.","1886":"When my husband and I got married 5 years ago we consolidated all of our accounts at different Banks to Bank of America and we have never been anything less than satisfied with the experience. We have 5 checking\/savings accounts--all at no cost--that help keep our finances organized. We can transfer money between all of the accounts whenever we want and pay our bills online in just seconds. We also have our home mortgage through Bank of America and it is easy to transfer our monthly payments to that as well as make separate principal payments right online. I guess we're a Bank of America family.","1885":"I used Bank of America for over 5 years, until they started imposing random fees and were unwilling to work with me on them. The fees were based on having an account. It was something that I was unaware of and they did not do a good job of getting the word out. There were also overdraft fees which were not my fault. I was unhappy with the process and with the corporation. At the local banks the tellers were nice and lines were not too long, but they could not help with major issues. After these issues I stopped banking with them and will never go back to Bank of America.","1884":"I have been a Bank of America customer for about 6 months now and I love it. There have been no fees that I was not expecting and the customer service has been amazing. I'm using the ebanking account and it fits my needs perfectly. I don't ever write checks only use my debit card, and I do everything through the website, the app or at an ATM so I have no need to go into a bank location. I would absolutely recommend this bank to a friend and actually have. One of my friends referred me and I've since brought 2 other friends to the bank and they love it too. The only thing that I would have to say I don't like about the bank is the waiting period for mobile app deposits: it takes 3 days between me taking a picture of a check and it actually being available in my account. Also, I don\u2019t like the hold period when I make a deposit at an ATM (there's the same 3 day period) but at least I get $200 of the check available right away from an ATM.","1889":"I've banked with a lot of credit unions and other major banks, but I just couldn't seem to find the one that was truly good for me... until I came across some ads for Bank of America. I was very interested in the proposals that I kept seeing from them, from commercials to ads on the computer, and they were even sending me mail. They have very good services and perks with banking with them, but to be honest sometimes the customer service is very lackluster and they seem incompetent. Like I said the actual services, such as credit cards, rates, percentage increase of my savings accounts and some other perks are very very pleasing to me, and it makes me glad to have a checking account with them, but at times the Customer Service kind of makes me want to switch to a different bank.","1888":"I have been with Bank of America for about 3 years now and am seriously looking into switching who I bank with. I chose this bank because I travel a lot and from my research at the time I found that this was supposed to be the most popular bank in America. At first I liked using this bank but I have found that there are not nearly as many Bank of America ATMs and banks as one would think. I often find myself driving a half hour to find one. I would just use another ATM but when depositing checks the only ATM that I can use is one that is part Bank of America\u2019s network and when withdrawing if I use another ATM I get charged five dollars per transaction! Another issue I have had recently is that my debit card got a small scratch on the magnetic strip on the back causing it to not work a lot of the time. As I said I travel a lot and have not been to my home state in about 5 months. I have gone to multiple banking locations and each time attempt to get a temporary card, which I have been told multiple times that they cannot give me because I am not in the state that my account is active in. Needless to say I am not a huge fan of using Bank of America. The only thing that I really enjoy about them is their online banking.","1883":"My husband and I both use Bank of America for all of our accounts. While other banks required special documents from him that would have been difficult to obtain in a timely manner (he is originally from Peru), Bank of America welcomed us, stayed with us through the whole application process, and patiently explained all the details. I cannot say enough about the customer service. The application process was also remarkably straightforward \u2013 we're a young couple and I was prepared to be intimated by the information forms required. Again though, with the help of customer service, everything was made clear and easy to follow. Regarding problem resolution, we have had two situations arise where we needed assistance: customer service was again swift and accurate in resolving our issues. I am confident that if the bank wants to solve a problem they can do it effectively. The mark down for the problem solving and the clear disclosures is in part because of the fee they will charge (about $7, nominal, but still significant for a couple who doesn't have much) if we want to go in the bank and ask a question. Although I've had a few questions I've avoided going in the bank to ask due to this fee. I've also occasionally found it difficult to determine whether a bill is officially overdue yet or not, and what the repercussions are; when money gets that tight. The last thing I want to do is have the bank asking for another ten dollar bill just to answer a question. Limits on number of withdrawals and overdraft fees have also been slightly frustrating, and were not fully established before we opened the accounts. That said, overall, we are both very pleased with having accounts at Bank of America. I Would definitely recommend it, especially to younger people.","822":"I have been a Bank of America customer for almost 5 years and have been completely satisfied with their level of service. I enjoy the convenience of online banking and the abundant amount of ATMs and branch locations. I have had several occasions that I needed assistance with a personal banking problem and their customer service representatives were always courteous and spent the time to ensure that my concerns were addressed. Most recently several of my co-workers and I had our banking information compromised. I was immediately taken care of by Bank of America, while my co-workers who dealt with other banks waited 1-2 weeks to have their claim settled. I will remain a customer and would recommend them highly.","820":"I opened a Bank of America account principally for the reason of having access to a joint account that I could share with my parents. When I was still in college, I moved across the country for an internship, and my parents wanted a way to send me some money during my extended stay, and so the notion of opening a joint bank account was appealing. Bank of America was the most convenient option. With offices and ATMs all across the United States, I was able to quickly and easily get money from my parents back home. The savings and checking infrastructure was easy, and I am still to this day impressed by the envelope-free check deposits at ATM machines. Even when I came back after my initial internship, I kept my Bank of America account open, and I maintain it to this day (even though I no longer need my parents to send me money...but if they're reading this, they should feel more than welcome to do so).I encountered no troubles with my Bank of America account, and the fast, convenient and free services were and still are of tremendous utility to me.","821":"My husband and I have been with this bank for a very long time. At the moment we're satisfied enough to not look for an alternative. Problem Resolutions are one of this bank's best assets. I remember one time when my husband's identity was stolen, and they jumped right on it, and fixed the problem very quickly. It really put my stresses at rest. When it comes to Customer Service they're not so bad, either. When my husband needs to ask questions, or check his account over the telephone they're very polite and always willing to help. I don't know much about Clear Disclosures or the Application Process, because my husband already had this account before we married. Anyway, I hope this helps someone who may be on the fence about this bank. Yeah, they're probably not the best bank, but they do okay, and at the moment I'm very content.","3511":"Bank Of America Exes Should Be Put In Prison!!!!!!!!! B of A\u00a0 frozen our business account over 2 years ago all our income is still going in but we can't get to it.\u00a0 We have spend over $100,000 on legal fees just to try to get them to release what is not theirs.\u00a0 They offered a settliment.They would give us 50% of our own money and they would keep the rest. How generous!!\u00a0 NOT!!! Criminals!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\u00a0 That is our money not theirs but they have a huge legal dept.

I find them consistent, reliable, and professional. I would not even imagine banking with another company. I use online banking and mobile apps to do all my banking and I find that these work efficiently and effectively for a busy on the go person. Every time I need to go into the bank, I found their staff professional and knowledgeable. I have always appreciated their consistency. Accounts through other institutions have rarely been the same experience. Anybody considering a new bank should seriously consider Bank of America. I also recommend their Money Market Accounts. I have also found those to be beneficial as well. The few times I have had to resolve issues with my credit card (such as questions about traveling abroad or security issues) their online customer service has always been professional and capable of quickly resolving the issue. Simply put: the best bank. I would not trust anyone else.","823":"Not great! The fees that Bank of America imposes on their customers are very well publicized but I didn't experience it for myself until I moved to a town where a Bank of America was literally across the street. Their services with regard to my checking account, ATM availability, and machines to cash in my change were what led me to signing up with them for my checking and savings. Big mistake. I hadn't so much as been with them for a month before I saw my first fee on my account \u2013 a 'checking account maintenance' fee! I was told I had to keep my account above a certain threshold of money (money that I didn't have) in order to bypass this maintenance fee. I bank with another bank now that is not quite as prominent or convenient but banks need to realize that customers do not like fees and will bank elsewhere.","824":"I've used Bank of America since I started college. They've been very helpful in both my banking and recover process. I started out just by having a checking account with Bank of America, then I moved on to getting a savings account, and later a credit card through them as well. On various occasions I've lost my debit card and they've been quick to replace it, in all instances. I also had one instance where I was the victim of fraud by a faux drug company for a weight loss pill. Bank of America was able to do an investigation and get my money back to me. I appreciate Bank of America's dedication to their customers.","826":"I have been banking with BoA for a little over 6 years now. I have not had many issues, but when problems have arisen, it's been difficult at times to get them resolved. Overdraft fees used to be a serious concern, because of the way the bank processes them. When I did get hit with fees, they usually racked them up 4 or 5 right on top of each other. Getting them resolved was usually a matter of a simple phone call.At one point I had my information stolen and someone began making unauthorized purchases with my card. Within 12 hours of calling the number I had a new card and every penny of the money that the thief spent was restored in full to my account.Recently I had problems with my credit card, and the bank has been extremely cooperative in helping me resolve my payments. As long as you have a good knowledge of what your payments are and you're working to pay them off (even if not in full), then you will usually find them agreeable to different terms.Overall, I am satisfied with the services I get from my bank, but I would definitely encourage people to read the fine print. BoA is known for being sneaky with some of the terms they put into agreements.","1705":"This was one of the first credit cards I ever had and I did like it. I always found Bank of America to be reasonable and fair. I was, however, very angry at them because after being a loyal customer for so long, they felt it necessary to give me an annual fee of.$39.99 for no reason. They just told me that the only way to avoid the fee was to cancel the card. To make matters worse, I had sent in a significantly large payment and after receiving it, they cut my credit down by 25%, again offering me no reason why when I asked. I do still have the card and they did manage to do one thing that showed me that Bank of America isn't totally heartless. I live in New York and was effected by Hurricane Sandy. When I went to pay my bill last month and I had no payment due. I called them and they told me that they waived all payments for people in the areas that Sandy hit. I thought that was really nice of them.Overall, the BOA cash rewards card is a decent credit card and the rewards are good when you get them. I would recommend the card to someone even though I had some problems with BOA.","1704":"I've been with Bank of America for 3 years now and have been very satisfied. Several times I have had companies make charges I never authorized and I was able to solve the issues very simply. A quick call to customer service and literally within 15 minutes on the phone, the entire problem was resolved. I do most of my banking online, and B of A has a great website that I fully trust. Their website is also jam-packed with information which I usually turn to for questions, avoiding the hassle of having to call the bank.While going on a trip outside of the US, I called the bank to inform them of my travels and I was able to do the entire thing with an automated machine. Usually, I hate machines, but in this case I simply entered my account information, where I was staying, and the length of time \u2013 and that was it. A very, simple clear process.","1706":"Just last week I went to Bank of America to open a checking account for my son who just turned 17 and got his first part time job. I was not happy with them at all. They attempted to sign him up for a plan that would cost him about 15 dollars per mouth when I know (from banking with them in the past) that he could have got a free checking account. Once I asked they complied and opened one that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t come with any strings but the fact that they would try to take advantage of him like that really upset me. Needless to say we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t open an account there but rather went to another bank. I am not impressed with their customer service at all.","1702":"Overall my experience with Bank of America has been positive. I have had maybe 2-3 issues with overdraft fees (a few years ago) but I think in all cases they waived the fee. I think the best things about Bank of America are their online support, and the ability to transfer money easily to other accounts. Most of my friends have Bank of America, so it\u2019s VERY easy to transfer them money if I ever owe them for something. As far as their online support goes, I think you can get pretty much anything done that you need through their chat. I have probably used it about 10 times, and have been able to get any issue I had resolved, and fairly quickly.","1701":"As a longtime customer of Bank of America, I have always been pleased with the prompt response to my inquiries and the timely emails regarding account activity. It is clear that Bank of America cares about each customer, although they are one of the largest banks in the world. One specific example of great customer service is when I called them regarding a transfer of funds between accounts. The rep assisting me told me about another option that not only saved me money, but in the long term, put a little extra cash in my pocket! I will be a Bank of America customer for years to come.","828":"I have banked with Bank of America for a long time. Their customer service is average. They never seem to go out of their way to be particularly helpful like a smaller bank might. Not many of my banking services are free or included. Also, when my debit card was stolen several months ago I went to the bank 4 separate times to order a new bank card because they were not putting it through the system correctly. They also forgot to cancel the card and then tried to stick me with the charges incurred even though they were in another state. They are easy to work with when you are setting up an account but if you use them, ensure that you educate yourself about the available products because they do not tend to inform you. After months of having my pay checks auto-deposited they finally told me I could get a free money market account and receive free cashier's checks and other perks. We are currently looking to switch banks.","827":"I like this credit card because of the rewards structure- 3% cash back for gas, 2% for groceries, and 1% for everything else. The one drawback is the 3% and 2% cash back is capped at $1500 in spending. After that you get just 1% cash back. They do have a new \u201cCash Back Deals\u201d option, which usually has about 5 or so different places you can earn extra cash back. You must go in and select the deals individually though, and then you just make a purchase using the card and it will give you the bonus. They do generally have a balance transfer promotions available, but their fee is usually 4% which is higher than some cards. Another thing that makes them stand out to other cards I have is the \u201cPortfolio\u201d option. You can enter all your other credit cards or banking accounts and it will keep track of when those bills are do and also calculate your net worth. Overall, it is a good card and I use it weekly.","1708":"When I first got an account with Bank of America some years ago it was great. I was young and making money and was just happy to have an active checking and savings account without really reading the fine print. A few years later Bank of America brought on a lot of fees and requirements for having a simple checking or savings account. This wasn't to my advantage since I was young and not making enough money to meet those requirements. I will say that Bank of America's customer service was always great and I knew that they were just doing their job when it came down to all the regulations. I would not recommend banking with them unless you can fully meet their requirements and not get charged an account activity fee every month. I am now with a credit union and it was the best decision I've made. I have a safe and reliable place to put my money without worrying if a new fee or guideline will pop up for my checking and savings account.","1707":"I recently switched all my business accounts over to Bank of America from LaSalle bank, because of convenience of locations in my area. As of now I'm regretting that decision. I've had numerous problems with the service since the changeover. My accounts fluctuate on a daily basis because of the nature of business and I'm supposed to get a warning when the account is low on funds. Several times I haven't received the warning till after the account is overdrawn already. This leads to fees upon fees that compound on top of each other. I pay for this warning service and their customer service has been spotty when it comes to helping me recoup my fees. Obviously this leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth and I will most likely be changing banks as soon as I can.","829":"They used to be my primary bank but there was some kind of mix up and an issue that caused all kinds of problems. They submitted direct deposit forms and overdrafted my account without me having any knowledge of this occurring. I had got some direct deposit information from them regarding direct deposit months earlier but opted out when my account was accidentally overdrawn. Then when they finally settled this dispute it\u2019s been 7 months and I still have not received my settlement payment. Their additional charges are ridiculous and the staff is often uniformed about the simplest banking options. It won\u2019t be long before I close my account.","1700":"This is one of the best credit cards I have had. I am able to get rewards based on how much I spend and what I spend my money on. Bank of America either lets you use these rewards on certain deals or it even lets you cash the rewards into money and deposit it back into your account. It is a very easy system to use. I am able to go online and pay all of my payments in about 20 seconds. I am also able to have alerts sent write to my email or as a text message about when my payments are due or when my payment has been posted. I would definitely recommend having this credit card.","1703":"They've always been really helpful whenever I had questions. I'll walk in and won't wait more than 5 or 10 minutes maximum when they are busy with other customers, and bring me right into their office. They always looked out for my benefit and only \u201csold\u201d me on promotional offers which benefited me, such as letting me know I would get 100$ right to my bank account if I set up direct deposit within 90 days of opening. Awesome! Keep the Change is a GREAT program to be enrolled in, too. In 3 months, you don't realize how much you ACTUALLY rack up. And it's fun to know that in one year, I'll get a random surprise pay day of the matching amount that Bank of America promises to give to me. Online Banking with them is extremely easy and convenient, especially with their mobile app. I can simply transfer funds between accounts when I need money instantly, and even do \u201cBill Pay\u201d when I forget that its bill day. Based on convenience, I honestly don't see ever switching. Other banks had always got me scared of overdraft fees and being too commercialized (not caring about the customer!) and Bank of America is the only one so far who has made me feel at least comfortable. Their customer service is always for my benefit, and I'm always thankful.","1709":"Bank of America has been the first bank that I had started using over six years ago, when I got my first job. I never regretted that decision, the way their checking and saving accounts are set up work for me perfectly. Just the fact of not having to pay for a checking account is a major plus for me. Their in-bank and online services are both amazing. The freedom you have on online checking is really good, too, and I praise it. You have the ability to check your account when you want, and even use the online features to write a check.","2123":"My Bank of America credit card was one of the first credit cards I had. It helped me build up my credit to pretty good standing that I had a phenomenal percentage rate on my balance. After I had gone through a never-ending divorce, I wanted to consolidate my bills. The only problem with that was that the loan percentage was going to be higher than the percentage being charged on my Bank of America card, so needless to say, I decided to keep this credit card. I have never regretted it for one day. It is now paid off, but I plan to keep this card for as long as I can. I would suggest getting in good with Bank of America. They saved me at a time when I really needed it.","2122":"I bought a house a few years ago and the best rates I received were through Bank of America. I was instantly pre-approved and got the house in no time! It was very scary to go through the process, but the Mortgage Loan Officer was extremely helpful, courteous, and easily walked me through it. I then signed up for a checking account through them, and I still have a bank account through them. The staff is very helpful. They go way above and beyond to help you with anything. I highly recommend Bank of America for any loan or checking needs.","2124":"I've been a Bank of America customer for a couple of years now. I'm really satisfied so far in the way they've handled my checking and savings account. My ABSOLUTE favorite feature of Bank of America is their online banking system. Unlike some banks that just have basic info displaying your balance, Bank of America goes all out. You can see where and what you spent your money on in order to keep better track of your finances and maybe even start saving a little more. The \u201cKeep the Change\u201d program is also really great. It helps take money that you would usually forget about and puts it into your savings account. The only problem I've run into with BoA is lack of locations if I'm out of state. In Michigan though, you'll find one on every corner.","2125":"Bank of America has been kicking around for a while. It is one of the largest banks in the area. I fear they have led the way in practices most don't agree with. Like another large local bank they have fees they truthfully blind side you randomly and for no apparent reason or warning. I am sure they are in fine print somewhere on the back of some pamphlet that no one really reads. Funny I left Bank of America for another bank not too long ago and the very same thing happened there. The \u201cother\u201d bank now has a civil case against them over it. I will stick to the little banks for now on because the big boys don't play nice.","2121":"I have had a personal checking account with Bank of America for over 5 years. Though it is not my only checking account I have to say that the ease and convenience of Bank of America cannot be beat. They have ATM's everywhere so I am always able to get cash and not pay a fee. And I love their Keep the Change program. I typically earn about fifty dollars a month through this program just by using my card for every day purchases. They also have many different types of checking accounts, including free ones, so I was able to find and account that met my needs perfectly. A wonderful, convenient bank for all of your personal checking account needs","2120":"I am a happy customer with Bank of America for almost 20 years now!! My husband and I got a checking account when no other banks would give us a chance. I am pleased with their service. We don't have to pay for our checking because my husband has direct deposit from his job and now since I found some work my direct deposits help too. Love having a checking account and debit card with them. I can even do my checks on online or over the phone, which we couldn't do back 20 years ago. Thanks Bank of America for all your hard work for keeping our money safe.","3512":"Greedy Corporate Bank With Poor Customer Service, Focused On Profit Margins Not Their Customers I understand how difficult customer service and banking can be. In my industry, I have lots of experience working with banks and various other service industries. However, I have never, in my life, hung up on any customer service folk. At Bank of America (BofA), I've hung up on 3. Let me summarize my worst\u00a03 experiences with this bank. 1) In 2010, I went to dinner at a Sushi Restaurant. When putting in my tip, the restaurant accidentally inputted too many numbers into the credit card till, and instead of a $45 transaction, my bill was a $45,908.54 transaction. BofA CLEARED this transaction and then spent over a week to reverse the money. At age 23, I did not have anywhere near this amount of money in my account and so I incurred, without doubt, a number of overdraft fees (this was before I finally realized a $45K+ transaction had cleared). Since it took them over a week to reverse the transaction, I was without money for a week. Furthermore, when I had called Customer Service to disput this transaction, the man on the phone asked me if I was trying to buy the restaurant. This was a serious question. Next, instead of reversing all of my overdraft fees, he only reversed half of them. I am not quite sure what his logic was here. 2) Recently, I had to write a few post-dated checks for a house rental. The rental company had deposited them all at once -- something they've done for the past few years. Every other bank would hold onto the checks and deposit the check according to the date listed. BofA cashed all checks immediately, and then started ringing in the overdraft fees. I called them again to disput this. The lady on the phone told me that BofA has no policy to cash checks according to the date listed on the check. In fact, if the check was post dated 6 months (or similarly, 3 years old or dateless), BofA would STILL clear the check. This hardly seems like a good security measure for your bank to have. Let alone a bank as big as BofA. In this instance, while the post-dated check clearing annoyed me, what upset me the most was how the customer service rep handled the issue. In summary, she had basically told me that: this wasn't her problem, it wasn't the bank's problem, and it was my problem to figure out. In fact, I believe she asked me the very question \"well, what do you want me to do? There's no way I'm reversing the overdraft fees and there's nothing else to do.\" 3) BofA likes flagging the most random transactions on your account as \"fraud\" and putting a freeze on your account without warning. One or two random freezes without warning, I can understand. The bank is just trying to protect your account and is freezing your card for security measures. However, it gets extremely frustrating and annoying\u00a0when this happens 4, 5, 6 times... and all, again, without warning. No email or phone call until the next day. By then, you are already aware your account has been freezed, because you were at dinner or out grocery shopping and your card\u00a0was (embarassingly) declined, and you have no idea why. For these reasons, as soon as I can, I will be switching banks to one that cares about their customers before their shareholders. A company that puts their shareholders and board members before the core of their business (their customers) will, inevitably, fail, and I hope the rest of America will see this soon.","2126":"I've used Bank of America for over two years. I actually opened my account by calling them and they set up everything over the phone. They are very convenient. They have ATMs just about everywhere in my city. At their ATMs you can pretty much do everything that you'd do using their drive-thru services. I never have to go in the bank or even use their drive-thru lanes. That's what I really like about Bank of America. Call me weird, but I'd rather not deal with people and do things quickly myself. When I do have to go in the bank, everyone is nice and they have great customer service. I refer my friends to this bank.","2127":"Bank of America is great. They have ATMs nearly everywhere, they provide very good service and they seem to have a myriad of products. I have a debit card with them and three accounts. I used to bank with them in Virginia, California and now New York.In every branch I've received very adequate service, fast replies and superior online services. I like their iPhone app, the benefits of my card, including discounts and realtime balances, etc.I think the best world to describe BoA is dependability. I count on them for many a banking task and they have never let me down: whether is a wire transfer, an update to my account or a special request, everything seems to be very smooth.Perhaps their only downside is the amount of customers they have. You could arrive one day and have to face a very big line. I think this varies according to state, but all and all this is the biggest bank so that is to be expected. Just choose your branch carefully and you'll be fine.","2128":"I have been banking with Bank of America for over 15 years. It was my first checking account. I enjoy the convenience of Bank of America's national brand and numerous ATMs all over the country. I have stayed with them for that reason and because I have my VISA card and checking account numbers memorized. But I have grown dissatisfied with the bank over the years. I feel like I am just a cog in their big banking system, and truthfully I don't know anyone at the bank personally that I could count on for help getting a loan or something else. In fact, I had to go through another bank for my student loans. Currently, I am also frustrated with the $12\/month maintenance fee and have begun researching local credit unions to join. I doubt I will bank with B of A much longer.","2129":"Bank of America was the first checking account I ever opened. Being young and naive, it was a popular bank so I thought I would have a good experience there. Boy, was I wrong. There was no trouble at first. It was what a bank was supposed to be. It held my money and caused very little in the way of undue drama. I had very little interaction with the branches besides depositing checks. Who likes going to the bank? They had tons of locations near me which was even better. As well as very conveniently placed ATMs in case I ever needed money. But then the fees started showing up. 10-15 dollars a month for something that used to be free. The people at the branch were no help in trying to get the fees waived. They would rather me leave than stay a loyal customer. What service were they providing that others didn\u2019t provide nearly the same for free? So I decided to close my account and move to Citi and I haven't been happier since. Let it be a lesson to BOA to try and nickle and dime its customers. They have other options and more often than not, they are better options too.","510":"Bank of America is a great bank who has handled my bank accounts for many years. I have had checking, savings, credit card and mortgage accounts with bank of America. Our local branch is friendly, on top of things and they take the extra time to send us holiday greetings. They now offer investment services within the bank and also have safety deposit boxes. I like their online banking system, it is much easier to pay my bills online and I can also use their phone ready site to transfer money, pay bills and check my checking account. I would recommend bank of America to anybody looking for a national based bank that is located in so many states across the United States.","511":"A little over a year ago I opened a savings account through Bank of America. I love the fact that I can go to the bank and withdraw my money out of my savings account if I absolutely need it. However, I chose to get my savings account through them, without having a card to use for convenience, so that I could actually start to save some money. In one year I have been able to save enough to have my emergency fund set for six months worth of income and plenty extra saved up for those pop up emergencies or for Christmas, which is just around the corner. Thank you Bank of America for making me feel financially secure.","513":"I have a Bank of America credit card. Although, the card took us several days to reach us, it is a very good and reasonable credit card. The rate of interest is quite low compared to the other cards and they also provide an overdraft limit of $500. This has been very useful during emergencies. I always pay back the balance in full. It makes me feel safe to know that I have the card during any emergency. Although, during the years there has been a lot of changes on the conditions on the cards, it is still just as useful. My credit score has also been good and any problem with the cards, the customer service representative respond quite well to the questions and are polite. I am very happy with the Bank of America credit cards.","512":"I\u2019ve been using my Alaska Airlines credit card for about five years, and have always been satisfied. The mileage bonuses you receive are good, and if you use the card often enough, you can build up a useful amount of miles. I don\u2019t usually get enough miles from the card to buy full mileage tickets, but it is useful for making up the difference when using miles received from purchasing other flights. It is a good card for people who commute often from Alaska to the west coast for school or work, as you can easily pay for a few flights, use your card often, and then have enough for additional Alaska airlines flights.","519":"I've been a Bank of America customer now for a little over 4 years and have not had too many problems with them. I am actually surprised to hear so many people don't like them. I usually just use the ATM for deposits and withdrawal and rarely ever go inside. But when I do, I'm always greeted with a smile and helped in a timely manner. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because their ATM machine does sometimes give me trouble accepting my checks, especially when I submit more than one at a time. But I like the fact that Bank of America was the first bank (I believe) that used the paperless deposits. No more having to write out a deposit slip or use an envelope. I love that about them!","1141":"Nothing about my banking experience with bank of America was pleasant. There was nothing but fees, fees, fees. I got $12 fees every time I spoke with a teller inside the bank. The tellers were rude, the ATM was constantly not working. I got an $80 fee once for them claiming I didn't have enough money in the bank at the time of a purchase, which was quite obviously untrue. I got fined when they \"fixed it\". That is when I left this bank. There was no good reason for them to charge me the fine, or the fee.","1148":"My experience with Bank of America has been nothing but positive. I have a joint account with my landlord and I pay my monthly rent to her with Bank of America. The best thing about them is that I live in a small town, and they are the only bank that you can make deposits at the ATM machine outside. This is good if I'm running late and the bank is closed or if I want to get the money in on the weekend. The people who work there have always been nice and answered my questions no matter how stupid they may be.","1147":"Bank of America is the only bank I will ever use. I have used Bank of America since I was 16 and my mother has used it for even longer. Everyone in my family uses this bank, as it is the most reliable and trust-worthy bank out there, in my opinion. Throughout my time with Bank of America, I have had them shut down my account due to unusual purchases or suspicious activities. This shows me that they care for my personal security and are always on top of identity theft. I was able to rectify these situations fairly easily with just a phone call. Their customer service support is absolutely excellent. I have never had any problems with employees. Overall, the service provided by this bank is incredibly satisfying and I don\u2019t see myself using any other bank in the future. I have high hopes that Bank of America will continue to offer great services for my family and me.","1145":"I've been with Bank of America for over 8 years now and I've had nothing but the best services every time I go in. I regularly go to three different Banks of America that are around me and the service is excellent every time I go to either of them. When the lines are too long inside they have the convenience of 2 tellers outside that you can deposit checks and cash in without having to go inside at all. The great thing about it is that it posts to your account the same day just as if you went inside and deposited your cash or check. With being a customer for over 8 years, I don't ever see myself switching banks as this one meets all of my needs and they have been nothing but great to me on each visit with no hassle ever.","1144":"I recently opened an online checking account. It is great in most ways except that when I do business in cash there is no way for me to make a deposit. For that reason, and that reason alone, I got a checking account at Bank of America. For my purposes they are great. The process of opening an account was very easy and when I've needed to make deposits, the tellers have been very professional and not given me any odd looks about why I was depositing so much cash at once. Overall, I am very happy with them and hope to continue my business with them for a while.","1143":"I have been banking with Bank of America for about 2 years now. I only started banking with them because my husband had an account here since he was young. It took us nearly 3 months just to get me added to the account, and another 3 months on top of that to get me a debit card. It was so much of a hassle that I would not recommend it to anyone. It seems like the system itself is the problem, because the people at the banks and the customer service over the phone are actually really great. They definitely do their hardest to try to make sure that the customer is happy. But with Bank of America there are too many draw-backs. They will not allow me to deposit my husband\u2019s checks from work without him being there even though we share the same last name and he endorsed it. They also charge a fee for not having direct deposit, yet they won\u2019t accept direct deposit from his job. They also do not support getting cards like Target Cards, which are just debit cards attached to your account.","1142":"I opened a checking account with Bank of America several years ago after moving to Florida from Nebraska. I was nervous about changing banks at first, but I have nothing but positive things to say about this bank. I enjoy being able to easily access my checking account information online and it is always up-to-date. Their website makes it easy to transfer money between my own accounts and also allows me to transfer money from my account to the accounts of other Bank of America customers. For example, my husband and I have separate checking accounts and we are able to quickly and easily make online transfers between each other's accounts with no fees. The Bank of America ATMs are also great because they allow me to deposit both cash and checks into my account and if the deposit is made before 8pm the funds will be available on that same day. Whenever I need to call the customer service number, the representatives are always very friendly, understanding, and helpful which makes banking with them even more pleasant.","1140":"I opened a Bank of America checking account several years ago. I use my ATM\/Debit card for any purposes that normally require a credit card. Over the years, I have had a few issues that required me to contact customer service, and they were always resolved quickly and efficiently. These included things like lost\/stolen debit cards (I always was given a temporary card right away - had to pick it up at the nearest bank branch - and a replacement card was mailed to me in a few days) and fraudulent charges (a crooked Internet company charged me for things I hadn't purchased, and BoA quickly refunded my money after a brief investigation). Additionally, BoA has branches all throughout Connecticut and the New York City area, which makes it very convenient to me as those are the two areas I frequent the most.","518":"This is a good credit card for me. I have been utilizing my account with Bank of America for about 10 years. The interest rate they offer is far below most others. That does not bring into view the most important part of being a Bank of America VISA Holder. The reward points are top notch. I probably get a $50 gas card at least once a quarter with them. I ran into some money issues a few years back. I was able to call them and they raised the limit for me with no issues. Being they showed me some loyalty to help me through some hard times I will always show them the same loyalty and utilize them as my #1 Credit Card.","514":"This bank doesn't have an awful reputation for fees for no reason. I was away one weekend and was relying on my BoA debit card for purchases. When I got home, I found that, despite my 'available balance' showing as being sufficient for my purchases, a large check was actually processed during the first day I was away, meaning that each of the payments for my purchases was no good. On top of that, I owed BoA close to $500 in overdraft fees. My logic in trying to understand this. How could I use the money out if it wasn't actually available in my account? At the very least, the transactions I made during the weekend should have gone through, and the check itself bounce, but it appears that transactions were processed in a way that would maximize the amount of fees the bank could recover. This was the final straw for me with this Bank. While it was convenient to get 99% of the account signup done online, everything about my experience with the bank was negative since I got the account. You'd be doing yourself a great favor by avoiding doing business with this bank at all costs.","515":"For many years I used Bank of America for all of my banking needs. After the collapse of the housing market, my faith in the bank began to sway. My checking account was suddenly subject to many different fees that had not been applied before and the overall customer service dropped. There were several situations that arose with my account, of which it showed discrepancies that made me really question if Bank of America was really the bank for me. I am still using Bank of America because I have several CDs in accounts with them, and I have noticed that overall their performance as a bank has drastically gotten better. Hopefully BOA will be able to return to the trusted giant that it used to be and reclaim its throne as the largest financial institution in the southeast.","516":"I have been a customer of Bank of America for the last 2 years since I moved to the US. The banking officer in Charlotte helped me open a Checking and a Savings account. And that got me a $50 reward - what more can I ask for! This checking account is the one where I get my direct deposits every month. The savings account gives me an overdraft protection on my checking account. It so happened once that I had issued a cheque and forgot about it. I didn't have enough money on my account and guess what - my balance in the savings account just took care of that! Amazing! I have also referred many colleagues and friends - and again that earned me some more money! Bank of America, I know, can keep my money safe","517":"My experience with Bank of America has started since 2008. I remember the first day I entered the bank and truth be told it was absolutely a great experience that I still feel until this very moment. Customer service was absolutely fantastic and people there were truly professional and motivated in dealing with each and every customer that walks through the door of the bank. The first amount that I deposited was about a 1000 dollars, which is not that much. However, my intentions were to try and see whether or not this bank truly deserves my trust and my money. Well, I have to admit that the manager whom I talk to at first was entirely focused on my thoughts and objectives, and answered all of my questions with great confidence. Also, I received 35 dollars on my checking account for referring a friend of mine to the bank. Day after day, I started to realize how this bank is convenient because it's almost everywhere, and it offers free service online, where you can check your statement without having to go to the bank. There is little waiting if no waiting at all when you go to get a loan, have an issue with your credit cards etc. All in all, I give the bank a solid B+ for its services, and I hope I can continue using its services with great pride.","1146":"Considering that I'm from Charlotte, NC, and BOA is headquartered in my home town, it only makes sense that I have been a BOA customer for many years. I have been pretty happy over the years with the level of service that I get from BOA. There have of course been some ups and downs with interest rates, ATM fees, international ATM fees, etc... But overall, I can\u2019t really complain! One of my favorite things about having my checking account and credit card with BOA is the immense amount of ATMs available in my city. They are literally everywhere I go and that just really makes life so much easier! I have always felt safe using my BOA cards anywhere I go, as I know that if anything is charged to my cards that I didn\u2019t authorize, that BOA will resolve the matter and credit my account properly. It\u2019s good for peace of mind, and just one more thing that keeps me loyal as a customer!","1149":"I love Bank of America. I started at 16 with checking and savings account and got a student credit card at 18. Within a year they upgraded me to this cash back rewards card and now they have raised my limit to more than I would ever need and lowered my interest to the lowest they offer. Bank of America always gives me the best service, rewards, and offers. I love this card and this bank.","410":"This is my favorite credit card that I have had since I started college. I have mostly used this card for school supplies and any other fees that have arisen throughout my college career. These charges I have made range from 400 to 1000 dollars. No matter what, the payments for me have stayed at $15 dollars a month. I have not had any issue with unexpected fees or an annual rate. It is definitely the perfect card for a college student although I wish it had more rewards that were offered. Since my main bank is Bank of America, I love that I can easily access my accounts all in one place.","411":"I have had this card with Bank of America since I was 18 years old and I love it. It has been 4 years since I applied and was approved with no problems. I pay my bills on time and thus have paid zero fees since obtaining this card. Through the Bank of America website, I have set up an automatic bill pay and never have to worry about paying my bill on time. I also asked recently for a monthly spending limit raise and was approved instantly. Additionally, customer support was helpful when I had to activate the card for international use during a long trip to Europe. Customer support followed up on all questions I had during the trip. Highly recommended.","413":"I have one credit card with Bank of America and have always had great customer service and absolutely no problems when interacting with the company or using my card. Even when I've lost it, customer service was swift in their actions to cancel it and issue me a new card. As a student, applying for the card was easy and uncomplicated, without any kind of gimmick to get me to pay more or charge me a very high interest rate. Overall, Bank of America provides me with an excellent means or credit, with great customer service whenever I need it. I am positive that they will continue to provide me this service and assist me with any problems that may arise.","418":"I bank mostly with Bank of America. I have a checking account with them which was super easy to open up. It was completely free. There are no fees for my debit card or anything. Their customer service is superb and prompt and their online interface is very easy to use. I have never had to dispute a transaction with them. A few months ago I was in a foreign country visiting family and I needed to stop for gas. I stopped for gas, paid for it, then got back into my car. The second I got back into my car my phone began ringing. It was Bank of America calling to say that they froze my bank account temporarily because of a strange transaction. After about two minutes of very detailed verification they unfroze my account and then gave me all the banking info I needed to bank in a foreign country. I think I\u2019ll use Bank of America forever.","417":"Bank of America is one of those giant names that you always hear of, but if you\u2019re like me, might never have used. This all changed a few years ago when I refinanced my mortgage. As previously, I went with a local mortgage company who then sold off the note to BOA. This is only my second mortgage (this one and the original one on the house with GE) and I have been very pleased with BOA. Like many people, I have ended up upside down on my loan, but that isn\u2019t BOA\u2019s fault. On the flipside, our township has lowered the taxes, and BOA reevaluated my monthly escrow charges and refunded the extra (and lowered my monthly payment) without any prompting from me.","416":"I've been with bank of America a little over two years now. I would have to say, they are just so-so. They have some very questionable policies about when they deposit and withdraw. They do all their withdraws in the morning before their credit deposits in hopes to overdraft you, then for each item that overdrafted because of that, you get a $30 fee. At one time I had $120 worth of fees because of that and was simply told that was how their system worked. Customer service is ok-ish, unless they want you to sign up for a credit card, then it's great. They will usually help you solve problems that they didn't cause though. The main reason I stay is their ATMs and being able to deposit cash and checks without going inside.","415":"My experience with Bank of America, while mostly positive, had an overall negative impression on me. Though the customer service was above and beyond my expectations, the fact that I had to seek the customer service in the first place was infuriating. They never explained aspects of their banking system to me, causing me to incur fees that I never anticipated. Though the fees were paid back, I was only reimbursed after complaining on the telephone to several different BoA associates. Their online banking system also leaves much to be desired, as it is completely confusing and the format changes too frequently to keep up with and no warning at all is given for the coming changes. Overall, though I enjoy the pleasant customer service interactions and the easy registration process, the bank left much to be desired.","414":"Bank of America has been my bank since I was a sophomore in high school! Although it is a large bank, that may seem impersonal, it is very fair. I\u2019ve been impressed by Bank of America\u2019s monitoring of my account. When I went to another state to buy something, my card was locked due to \u201cunusual purchases\u201d Although this may seem like an inconvenience, it showed me that Bank of America was serious about protecting my money. Also, a few months back my card number was stolen, and used half way across the country. Unfortunately Bank of America didn\u2019t catch on this time, but when I noticed it and reported it, Bank of America refunded my money! That refund came right out of their bottom line, to me. That meant a lot, even though they didn\u2019t steal my card number and use it (some random person did) they still took responsibility for it happening and refunded me!","412":"Bank of America is an okay bank. There are a lot of things I don't like. I did not like it when they wanted to have debit card monthly fees, but thankfully they got rid of it. There have been times when I had mysterious charges and this required several phone calls to rectify this. The times that I did call them my problems were resolved though. I wish there were safer ways to manage my money. Bank of America has a bad reputation too, despite their good customer service. They just reek of greed and I want to leave them as soon as I can.","419":"I have been a Bank of America customer for over 2 decades. Sadly, I think it\u2019s time for me to move on. I\u2019ve become increasingly frustrated with their glitch filled online banking system and their poor customer service. In part I think there is a correlation between the increase in my disappointment in Bank of America\u2019s customer service and their recent acquisition of Merrill Lynch and several other financial institutions. My reasoning is mostly derived from the fact that a majority of the short comings are a result of a redundant bureaucracy. So many people are performing the same tasks that other important one\u2019s get ignored. For example, a few weeks ago I lost a credit card that was issued by Bank of America. So, naturally I went into my local branch and waited 1.5 hrs for an accounts rep. They then proceeded to pass me around from one rep to another before I could explain why I was there in the first place.","540":"I have this card and my rate is 4.99% permanent not introductory and I also earn points which I chose for cash but they can be used for products too.","541":"I have very mixed feelings about the Spirit Airlines card. On one hand I do think it offers good rewards compared to the cards of other airlines. You get two miles for every dollar you spend, which is right up there with the best cards. You can also get 15,000 bonus miles after your first purchase. All of this sounds great, but just remember that Spirit is no the most costumer friendly company around. They were rather unclear about the requirements to get, and keep the bonus miles. You must make a purchase with the card every month to do so. This is no problem for me, it just was not clearly explained to me when I was applying for the card. There is also a annual fee of $60. This is a little annoying, but if you use the card enough to earn some free flights, $60 is nothing to complain about.","542":"I have had this Bank of America credit card for over two years now and would recommend it because of cash back that it offers. I also have a Capital One card that offers 1% cash back so I usually use that one instead when making most of my purchases because that one has a helpful end-of-the-year summary that I often refer to when completing my tax returns. However, this is a great card because it offers 3% cash back on purchases made at qualifying gas stations and 1% cash back on other purchases which can add up quickly. It also advertises 2% cash back on groceries, but I usually shop at Walmart and Publix which are not part of the qualifying stores to receive the 2% cash back offer which is kind of annoying. It is also convenint because the rewards can be directly deposited into my Bank of America checking account whenever I authorize it for an extra 10% bonus.","3513":"Business Checking \/ Savings Bank of America just charged my business savings account an annual $150 maintenance fee for a savings account that was told was free with my business checking account.\u00a0 I do $250,000 in annual credit card processing with bank of america.\u00a0 They would rather steal $150 from a good customer than to keep my business.I'm moving my accounts this week to another local bank.","543":"I have been with bank of America for about 3 years now. I use paperless which means everything I do is online or at the ATM. This helps me avoid getting monthly fees; however it means that I can't go into the bank for help. Recently, I brought in change because you can't deposit change at an ATM and they charged me a 9 dollar monthly fee! It was the first time I had gone into the bank in the three years I've been with them! This was very upsetting and of course they refused to take it off my account. Other than that one incident I have never had a monthly fee. I also like that deposits are instant and that they process everything very quickly. If it wasn't for the late fees, however, I would probably switch over to Wells Fargo because they have much better customer service and savings interest rates.","544":"The Bank of America Basic Visa was one of the first credit cards I had. When I first received the card, I was in college and I did not have much of a credit history to speak of. In that respect, it was nice, but that's one of the few positive things I can mention about it. Bank of America's rates are unreasonably high and you need to be extremely careful to be diligent about your payments. Miss a payment and your rates are likely to double (this is in addition to an exorbitant late fee charge). BoA's website (which I use solely for payment of the Visa) is not very intuitive, but I guess it works once you figure it out. I guess in terms of a basic credit card, this is fine if it's all you qualify for. Then again, I'd be hard pressed to agree to terms that were less customer friendly. The card did however pave the way for better credit cards with far better terms.","546":"I'm relatively new to the BankAmericard Cash Rewards card, only having been a card holder for just a few months, but thus far am very pleased with my experience. In fact, I think this card is going to be a top contender for most frequently used. The first thing that attracted me to this card was the 3% cash back on gas and 2% on groceries - something I always have to buy, so why not save some money doing it? The 1% cash back on all other purchases is pretty standard for a cash rewards card, but in conjunction with the gas and groceries, makes this card very nice overall. There is a $100 cash back bonus for spending $500 within the first 3 months of the card, which is just icing on the cake. The other great thing about this card is there is no annual fee.","545":"I\u2019ve been using the Bank Americard for a little over two years and have mostly positive things to say about it. The customer service has been great, as I have needed to call in a few times with regards to increasing my credit limit and to report a lost card. Each time the representative was helpful, pleasant and quite efficient. My credit limit started at $800, but was increased to $1000 with a simple call and only a few questions regarding my employment status. It is a rather \u201cbare bones\u201d card in the sense that you don\u2019t get any rewards, but it is very simple to use. It connects with your Bank of America online checking account which makes it very easy to pay monthly bills as well. All in all, I would recommend the card for young adults or students looking for their first basic credit card, as was the case with myself.","547":"Well, I have been a member of Bank of America for over ten years now and was the first bank that I was a member of when I started the whole banking process. I have stuck with this company over the years because I have felt as though they have been very fair and equitable to me. Whenever I go into the bank I am always treated very politely and I feel like they actually take the time out of their day to really discuss and work through any issues that I might be having at the time.I was able to go through the process of applying and receiving a loan for the condominium that I was planning on buying with my fianc\u00e9. It was a very easy process to get the loan going and I found out about the answer in little under a week. I feel like I have been treated very well throughout the loan time.I will definitely stay with this company for many more years as I am very impressed by their company and their associates!","548":"I signed up for the BankAmericard in August after closing a different credit card. The BankAmericard has proven to be pretty simple to use since it has a minimum blanket cash back rate. I don't have to coordinate my purchases with this card since it honors all of them. In addition, the card earns higher rates for gas and groceries, which is a huge incentive for me. In my experience, the initial credit limit given was relatively low, but I'm hoping to increase my limit with this card over the next six months. I've also received plenty of mail briefing me on the terms of the card and its rewards so I can attest that the information given is comprehensive.","549":"Bank of America is so wonderful, not just because they offer what I am looking for, I can find everything I need all at one place! It is nice knowing that when ever I need a car loan, house mortgage, personal loan, bank of America is there to help. Their customer service was completely a plus, knowing that all my questions have an answer, is another reason why I love them so much! However, like every place they have their faults too such as fees. What I mean by this is, every month they charge a maintenance fee to your account! Other than this small \"fee\" I give this union a ++++.","1980":"Hello I wish the Special Olympics Credit Card will come back! Because I liked it and I thought It was a good card!","1984":"I've had this card for over 8 years and have found it to be the most difficult credit card to manage. I haven't used this card in two years with the exception of minor purchases to keep the account open. Having previously had all of my accounts through Bank of America, I figured it would be worthwhile to have my credit card through them as well. I was wrong. The interest rate is pretty terrible, the online account management system was alright, but the worst was the customer service. Compared with other companies, they really do not care about their customers as was evident when I tried to dispute a charge. There are much better products out there. The only reason I would recommend this card is if you have all of your accounts through Bank of America and only want to login once to get a complete snapshot of your finances.","1982":"I have been using this card since I started college a few years ago. I use it on everything - groceries, gas, buying goods, online purchases, and paying my bills. It's easily managed from the BoA website, where I can easily track my purchases and also pay it off using my checking account. There have been no problems so far and I absolutely love the transparency and control I have over managing my credit card. If I ever do need help, BoA has a help section that is very easy to find and navigate. One time, I lost my card at school and couldn\u2019t find it, and I was able to quickly suspend my card and obtain a replacement one the next weekend without much hassle. I would definitely recommend this card to people.","1983":"I've only had this card for a little while now. I can say that it is definitely worth it though. I've had a rewards card before, but I never ended up with enough points for anything I wanted. I like that you get cash back with this. They also reward you an extra percentage if you bank with them as well. I don't remember how much it is though, but still it's really awesome. It's little things like this that make me love bank of america, and love my card. Best of all there isn't a crazy interest rate. I usually pay everything off at the end of the month anyway. But its nice to know that if I need to make a bigger purchase I won't regret it because of the interest.","1981":"I got this card for college. It had a $100 bonus for signing up. It's a pretty nice rewards system, and you get an extra 10% cash back for having a BoA checking account (too bad BoA checking has tons of fees). Overall, I'm happy with the card. I use it for gas and groceries. I'm glad they made it available to students. I just wish they had more rewards for student related things, like books and restaurants. Also, I wish they didn't require a BoA checking account for the extra 10%. I'll be closing it as soon as I get the $10 extra from the $100 bonus. Because just using a BoA account for 10% extra on 1 or 2 cents is ridiculous.","1985":"I have to say I've been with Bank of America a long time, and during that time they have been pretty good at providing a good system for paying your bills online. My wife and I have been able to set up bill payments that recur and can be fluid at times. As a result, we've had to worry less and less about when the bills get paid. A lot of banks are doing bill payment systems now too, but I think Bank of America had one of the best ones starting out. I'm not crazy about some of the fees they have, but overall my experience with them has been pretty non-confrontational, which is saying a lot for a bank.","1987":"I got my Bank of America credit card ten years ago as a college student and I have kept it ever since. I've never had any problems with this card, it is very straightforward and easy to use. I've used it to pay for vacations, shopping, and have also transferred a couple balances to the card when I had all of the charged paid off. The only negative that I see with this card is that the Bank of America online payment system seems a little behind the times, compared with Chase or Discover. I sometimes have difficulty logging on to the site to pay my card, and it seems like you have to jump through quite a bunch of hoops just to make a payment. Otherwise, the card itself works great.","1986":"I was a BofA customer for a few years. The individual staff members I interacted with were polite and friendly, but the corporate, impersonal structure and protocols of the bank caused me to close my accounts.One thing I found puzzling was that in order to transfer my personal checking and savings accounts to another state I was required to complete a new application, take paperwork to my old branch in person, mail some documents to a central location, and wait a few days.In a professional capacity, I liaised with various BofA representatives to help international customers open bank accounts upon their arrival. Although I believe the laws have now changed in favor of the customer, at the time it was the law that accounts with debit cards were set by default to allow charges to be accepted at the POS even if the charge resulted in an overdraft, i.e. even if there was not enough money in the account to cover the charge. The customer could request the account to be set so that this did not happen, but the reps never explained this to the customers, and the international customers, who often did not have strong English skills, did not know to ask! I would never have thought to ask this myself. It was rather sickening to me that the reps were told to not tell the customers about this, while they handed out plenty of BofA-branded swag bags, mugs, iPod speakers, pens. It made me wonder if the overdraft fees of unsuspecting customers went directly to purchase these marketing gimmicks.","3514":"Bank Of America I have my mortgage with Bank of America, and when I went to pay my mortgage payment for September I typed in $1,100, and they took out $2,300. I found out, after calling my own bank after my debit card was declined, that Bank of America had taken out twice what they were supposed to. It's been two weeks, and after doing everything they required, the money has yet been put back into my account. If I am ten days late on my payment I am penalized. And yet I have no recourse. The customer service department is very difficult to get a hold of, and when you do get someone they can't help you. And this is not my first bad experience I've had with Bank of America. I wish things were different, but this is how it goes so often. Mary H.","1988":"The Susan G. Komen Visa that Bank of America offers is a great card for everyday consumers for several reasons. First of all, with every purchase Bank of America donates to the Susan G. Komen foundation, which strives to fight the battle against breast cancer. Everyone has a soft heart for this cause! The \"3-2-1\" cash back rewards systems is good for everyday purchases. 3% back on gas, 2% back on groceries, and 1% back on all other purchases; this structure is good because everyone must buy gas and groceries regardless. Overall I am happy with this card and will continue to recommend using this card.","1989":"Bank of America is the ideal company for the average American family. My spouse and I recently had a baby and wanted to build a new home, because at the time we were living in a one bedroom apartment. The home that we wanted to build was way over our price range, so that's when we decided to seek help in Bank of America. They lent us the money to build our home, it was a smooth process, and made us feel at ease with our decision. They were not pushy about the payments, but let us decide when we wanted to pay. We made low monthly payments, and have since paid off our home. I would recommend Bank of America to anyone that is looking for a loan. They are very helpful, you feel safe and secure throughout the entire process, and the customer service is unbeatable.","3515":"Mortgage Customer Service My sister died in March, 2012.\u00a0 As a result, she missed her next mortgage payment.\u00a0 Bank of America called to inquire -- they asked for her, and I told them that she was dead.\u00a0 Within an hour, they called again.\u00a0 Despite the fact that I informed them that she had died, they continued to call -- approximately a dozen times.\u00a0 When I received her death certificate and life insurance proceeds, I went to the local branch and paid off the mortgage.\u00a0 They accepted the payment.\u00a0 A few months later, I called the mortgage unit, and I was informed that I do not have authority to receive any information.\u00a0 I called the enterprise estate unit, and was informed that they had not received the death certificate.\u00a0 I am trying to retire the mortgage, but I cannot get any information as to why they have not released the lien on the house.\u00a0 I paid off the mortgage, and submitted the paperwork that they asked for.\u00a0 The mortgage unit refuses to give me information, but they were certainly willing to accept my money. When I was trying to make funeral arrangements, Bank of America kept calling to ask to speak to the deceased.\u00a0 They continued to call and ask for her, until they reduced me to tears.\u00a0 They provoked an angry response after about a dozen calls asking to speak to a dead person.\u00a0 They simply refused to stop calling for her.\u00a0 And when I got angry, they told me that my behavior was inappropriate.\u00a0 The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.\u00a0 I just want to end this nightmare and terminate any relationship with Bank of America","1952":"This is the first credit card I got because I was using Bank of America for my savings account so I thought why don't I get the card the cash back is great. The cash back you get on purchases is awesome and quickly adds up so I have been using the card a lot more for everyday purchases. I have not had any problems when I have had to contact customer service to clear up issues. I really like this card and would recommend this card to anybody looking for a credit card the rewards program is great and you will find yourself using it often and wont be disappointed.","1951":"I've been using this card since I was 18 as BoA was one of the first to provide me with a card since I was young. I've never had any issues at all using it and the rewards are GREAT! The 3% on gas is great it really helps on some of the months when things are a bit slower than others. I use this card for everything and it seems that my credit score reflects what this card and I have been able to do together. This card is great and I love how easy it is to pay off my balances with it.","1950":"I got my Bank of America Visa card about three years ago. It is a company purchase card, which was issued to me by my employer for work related purchase. It does not have any 0 APR or 0 Balance Transfer or cash reward, which is right since I cannot take advantage of a company credit card. In addition to the convenience of using this card for work-related purchase, what made me feel very good about it is that it provides very good protection against fraudulence. A few months ago I got a call from BOA representative asking me if I had made several suspicious purchases, which had not been aware of. BOA quickly cancelled the transactions and gave me instructions on how to get a replacement card. When the company finance supervisor contacted me a couple of days later after he got a letter from BOA on this issue, I proudly told him that the issue had been dealt with and resolved.","3516":"10 Years Ago Was A Great Bank, My Fav. but now, zero customer service...i still have a couple of accounts there, but eventually i will switch away.","1953":"Years ago, I opened a checking and savings account with a local, smaller bank around the corner from my house. Everything was was fantastic for about 2 years, until the place was purchased by Bank of America. The bank took on a cold, corporate feel, and seemed to be run more by the corporate computer than by the local management and tellers.Professional, distanced customer service I can deal with; the part that got me was the fees. My first (and only) overdraft, 3 years into banking with them, was due to an honest mistake. Most banks will forgive you one overdraft, but the exorbitant $35 fee stuck. Then, the once-free checking started costing me $12.00 a month, and they instituted a $2.00 per transaction for pulling money out of another bank's ATM.I can't say that there was a single event that lead me to close my accounts with Bank of America. Honestly, it was the feeling of being nicked and dimed to death for the privilege of accessing my own money, and, in a competitive banking market, there's just no excuse for that.","3517":"Worst Bank I don't normally like to give negative reviews, I feel that some places should be given a fair chance but this bank is terrible.\u00a0 I do not recommend it to anyone.\u00a0 The first thing that happened was they cut off my debit card temporarily due to \"suspicious spending\".\u00a0 It was around Christmas and I was doing Christmas shopping.\u00a0 What a terrible thing to have happen, a shopping cart full of things, and a card that will not go through!!\u00a0 I received NO phone call, NO warning.\u00a0 When I called, I was told because I was spending more money than usual.\u00a0 I appreciate the gesture, but please call me beforehand next time.\u00a0 That was very embarrassing.\u00a0 I had to put all of the shopping onto a credit card that I save for hard times.\u00a0 It was a huge inconvenience.\u00a0 The second thing that happened was my savings account.\u00a0 I was charged a $12 monthly maintenance fee that I had never been charged before.\u00a0 I also noticed that my savings no longer said savings, but checking.\u00a0 My husband and I opened this account a while back for emergency funds.\u00a0 We don't use it very often.\u00a0 When I called, I was told it was because they have a new policy where they only accept 6 deposits into the savings account a month, and because my husband and I use the \"keep the change\", we had more than that.\u00a0 Again, no call, no warning, no notice. This is the worst bank I have ever been with and I am cancelling the account.\u00a0","1954":"I got my Bank of America Visa card a few years ago. It has been indispensable to me since then. I've used it quite frequently and without problems. Bank of America's customer service has been always useful and concise with their help, doing the best they can to accommodate my issues whenever I had any. There are Bank of America banks everywhere so it's easy to deal with the bank directly if I need to. The terms of service are simple to understand and completely fair. I would recommend this card for anyone in the market for a new credit card.","1958":"I love this card! I usually use my Amex but that isn't accepted everywhere so I also use this one. I have had it for a while and always pay the full amount due each month. I earn rewards quickly and easily (there are NO catches!) and would definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking for a card with a reward program and low rates.","1957":"We have had this card for over a year now, and love it. From the start, we got fifteen months with no interest and no fees. We also took advantage of a balance transfer to help consolidate our debt. The real advantage though, of course, is the cash rewards. We try to use this card for all our gas and grocery shopping to maximize our rewards. This card also makes it very easy to claim the rewards, as it just requires a few clicks on their website. The website also ties in my other Bank of America mortgage account, so that I can manage all of my Bank of America accounts with a single login, which makes dealing with finances much easier.","1956":"The Bass Pro Shops Credit Card is awesome. I would recommend it if you love the store. And who doesn't. You can use it online, in the store, or in there catalog. They give you rewards on anything and everything you purchase. They add up if you like to be outdoors. They even have things for everyday uses. Once I received the card they even sent me a coupon for $10 off my next purchase. The Bass Pro Shops card is very good because I had purchased an item for my gun which ended up not being the right part. I didn't even have the card yet and the customer service person was able to still make sure that the money had been credited back to my card with no problems. Would recommend to anyone. You won't regret it.","1955":"I've been using the Bank of America Cash Rewards VISA credit card for about 2 years now and I have been really liking it. The rewards seem really fair, especially when getting gas where they give you 3 percent back which can save several dollars. They now have a new rewards deal going on where particular stores give even larger rewards on top of the usual 1-3% back based on the category of the store you shopped at. I have the card set up to automatically transfer my rewards balance to my checking account when it reaches $25 and it really adds up quickly. Bank of America's online banking is superb and it could not be easier to manage the credit card and payments online and using their mobile banking app.","1959":"This is a great credit card with no annual fee. I like the fact that on top of getting 1% cash back on all purchases, it is 2% cash back on groceries and 3% on gas. Since groceries and gas are necessities you add up points while stocking up on what you need. Additionally, it has the $100 when you spend $500 or more during the first three months (which is quite a leisurely spending pace), and you get 10% more when you redeem it into your Bank of America checking account for a total of $110. Additionally, 10% also applies whenever you redeem any of your rewards into your checking account. Finally, I was given 12 months of 0% APR on purchases, which has allowed me to use the card to try to focus on paying down other cards. Bank of America customer service representatives have always been very helpful whenever I contact them with any questions or concerns. Everything considered, I recommend this card very highly.","693":"This credit card was a bonus for me because I already had a normal BoA card. I figured it would be better to rack up returns on gas and groceries since I buy those things often. Also, signing up for the card and spending a certain amount within a time limit gave me an additional $150 credit. I absolutely love the fact that this card gives you 1-3% for every transaction. So far, I would say I have received about $250 in free money from using this card, and I literally use it for everything. You also get the bonus of 10% extra if you transfer the bonus into another BoA savings account, which doesn't end up being a ton of money, but once again, it is easily earned.I would totally recommend this card to anyone that can afford to pay it off in time, as the interest rate is high. This card is totally worth the returns though.","690":"The Bass Pro Shops Credit Card is definitely one I would recommend if you love getting rewards and shop at Bass Pro Shops often. With this credit card, you get rewards everywhere you use it, and you can get even more when you use it at Bass Pro Shops. You can use the reward points you earn toward anything in the catalog, online or at the store, and the rewards really add up quickly the more places you use this card. It sure is nice to earn rewards at a place you shop at often anyway, and this is a great way to do it! If you want a credit card with a great rewards program for your favorite store, you will definitely want to check out this one.","691":"We had a Bank of America card up until about a month ago. It was not our main card and wasn't used often. We mainly used it for trips or occasional unplanned purchases. It was nice because we were able to separate the purchases from our regular purchases. We also knew that there would always be available space for emergency situations. We got a letter from them recently informing us that the card was cancelled. They indicated that we had not used the card in over six months and due to the idle account it was closed. We were not given any chance to keep the card active. We never missed a payment. We always paid it off in full in fact whenever possible. This was a bit of a shock to us and we didn't appreciate that letter.","692":"I first started using the Alaska Airlines Credit Card when I lived in Alaska 5 years ago. I have appreciated the benefits tremendously. I was able to use my miles to fly my in-laws to Alaska to visit. I have no complaints about the service or card use. The fee is reasonable considering the mileage benefit received, and Bank of America as a service provider has been good to work with. Just be sure to contact them before you travel so that their fraud department doesn't halt your credit card transactions! Otherwise, keep on buying and enjoying the benefit of all those Alaska Air miles!","3519":"Bad Banking This bank is bad, there accounts online sometimes do not match or if you call there 1-800 number they will tell you the wrong thing about your checking account. If you make a big deposit, they will hold it up to 10 days or more and only give you less than half, but wait, if you get paid 1 time a month and you write a check on the 31st and you get paid on the 1st,and your paycheck is there on the first and the check you rote clears on the 1st of the month they will put the check you wrote first so that it will bounce and they will charge you a 35.00 fee. Someone should stop Bank of America, this is bad on the poor, lower class people. Everyone and I have had this happen more than once.","3518":"Confusing And Arbitrary Rules I honestly chose them because they are pretty much everywhere, including a few blocks from my house. I started banking with them in February 2012. One of the things I like about them is that they allow you to resolve overdrafts within 5 days, before charging you an overdraft fee...or so I thought. \u00a0 Apparently, they only allow you to do that if you, for instance, went to buy something, didn't have enough funds, and ended up with a negative in your account. If it was an authorized\/automatic payment (like a monthly bill, for example), you get charged immediately. Which is fair, but it would've been GREAT if I had known that. Because of that, I have $11 in my account right now for the rest of the week, and I don't even know how I'll survive.","694":"The name got it right, this is a good basic card. Terms are standard terms and fair. No annual fee. On-line banking is simply, easy and convenient to use. They have standard fraud protection, although it seems it's a little strong sometimes - recently my account was flagged for suspected fraudulent activity because I tried to rent a bike from a local town's bike-share kiosk. They did notify me very quickly, and the process to get it handled was quick and easy since I could do it on-line, although for some reason they unlocked the use of my card before allowing me to access the on-line banking again, which seemed weird, especially since they locked the on-line banking a full day after locking the card. It all got fixed though, and the process wasn't painful at least.","699":"My parents had used this bank for a while and so when it came for me to get a credit card a few years ago I followed in their footsteps.I like how easy it is to use and understand. The rewards program, specifically the cash back part, is fantastic and plays a big role in my daily life. 3% back on gas is actually a bigger deal than I had first thought and I am so glad I chose to go with this card. 1% cash back on everything else is also quite fruitful in the long run.It is important to understand that if you do not pay your debt off then it affects the cash back benefits you get. Therefor to truly reap the benefits you must be debt free, or somewhere close to that.All in all, an excellent card.","698":"I have had this card for a year and now it is the main card I use out of the 13 credit cards I have. In the past I have normally used by Bank of America debit card for all my transactions. Now I enjoy using this Bank Americard cash rewards card more, because I get 1%- 3% depending on my purchase. If I deposit my rewards to my checking account, I get an additional 10%. I\u2019ve cashed out my rewards (minimum of $25.00) about 4 or 5 times and couldn\u2019t be happier. This card gives me more consumer protection than my BOA debit card and I actually get some cash back from the stuff I would normally purchase. Totally worth if you already bank with BOA.","697":"I have been using this card for about 2 years now, and I could not be happier with it. The sign up process was so simple, I couldn't believe how quickly I was being approved for a credit card! As this was my first credit card, the limit was actually a good thing and kept me from overspending. All the associated fees are very fair and reasonable, I never feel burdened using this card. All in all, this is a very good credit card, and I will probably keep using it for years to come. Although I have since gotten other offers, I see no reason to ever switch. I am very satisfied.","696":"I have been using the Alaska Airlines Credit Card for 10 years now, and the benefits have been tremendous. The companion fare that I have received each year has allowed myself and my family to fly back to Seattle more frequently and for much less cost. I have also been able to build up a large amount of frequent flyer miles, which can be used for discounted or complimentary flights anywhere Alaska or Horizon Air flies. Not only have the mileage benefits been good, but the Alaska Airlines credit card has also allowed me to maintain a good level of credit.","695":"I absolutely love this card and I love Bank of America. Who gives 3% cash back on gas! It's awesome! The 1% cash back on other purchases adds up quick! I use this card for everything from simple fast food to online purchases to paying bills. I love to use it online for the cash back reason considering I used to use paypal and GET charged. Now I get cash back! Simple, quick and easy to use. They have great customer service and reward programs that pile up before you know it. As you're living life, you get little bonus rewards that are really nice. I have them deposited into my BOA checking account (which I also love) automatically and get an extra 10% I would recommend Bank of America and this card to everyone!","551":"I\u2019ve had this card for almost a year now, and been very happy with it. Their rewards program is very good and very easy to understand. It also of course is accepted pretty much everywhere I go. I also really like their card owner website. It is easy to navigate, and ties all my Bank of America accounts together in one easy to access, secure, location. I use this card for everything from clothes to groceries, and definitely take advantage of the additional cash back on gas and groceries. If someone wants to pay you to spend money you\u2019re going to have to spend anyway, why not take advantage of it?","550":"My wife and I have used this credit card for close to seven years now. We started out with a low limit, but we weren\u2019t too concerned about it. We always paid the balance, so we have not had to accrue interest or fees. I have appreciated how simple and practical this card has been for us without causing any issues. We recently came upon the expiration date, and we were automatically sent new cards without any hassle. There was also a time when we were sent new cards because there was a security risk; while I would rather not have any risk at all, I was happy that they were keeping watch and were cautious. We plan to keep using this card indefinitely!","552":"My experience with Bank of America was short-lived. I opened an account while in California visiting my father, because he wanted me to have an account at a bank that was local to him (my usual bank is on the east coast only) so that he could easily deposit money when needed, as he prefers to give me cash instead of items for presents. The problems started when I returned home to NY. I set up one of my direct deposits to go into the account so it wouldn't charge me any fees, but when I went to use my debit card after every 2nd time I used it my card would be flagged as stolen and I wouldn't be able to use it until I called the 800 number. I explained the situation multiple times and asked each time to have a note added to the account saying that I was a student and the card was not stolen every time it was used in NY, and was told each time this was not possible, and my options were either to close the account, wait, and then open a new one in NY and hope that someone depositing cash from California wouldn't get my account flagged, or deal with my debit card being shut down every other time I used the card. Some of the customer service folks I spoke to were friendly and sympathetic, some however were very rude and couldn't understand why anyone would ever spend time in a different state than the one they had opened a bank account in - I guess they've never heard of college students or people who live by state borders or move!I closed the account after 3 months, there were no benefits to the account that were worth putting up with the hassle.","3520":"Bank Of America And On-Line Banking I have been a Bank of America customer since it took over the Las Salle Bank in Chicago. \u00a0They steered me to on-line banking which was a lot easier to do reconciliations with, especailly since I didn't need to wait till the end of the month to do the reconciliation. \u00a0However a year and a half ago, when logged into on-line banking, I would be able to read the balance but nothing else. \u00a0Moving to the next step meritted a return to the log in screen. \u00a0Several phone calls lead to the answer, \"We are working on the problem.\" \u00a0After three and a half months, the problem ended, only to return fouir months later. \u00a0At this time, and after about a week of calls, \u00a0they established a second on line profile which went around the problem. \u00a0Again in a few months the original profile was working. In early spring this year, a new problem developed in which I could access the on-line account, but not do anytjing with it....like reconciling the account, transfering funds, and downloading statements. \u00a0Again I talked to customer service who assured Me it would be fixed.....it is now August, and today I am looking for a new bank. \u00a0How can I trust Bank of America with my money, when they can't even keep their on-line banking services working properly, \u00a0and when the customer service can't fix the problem, or at least advise they need work on it, and takes no time to keep one informed about what it is doing. \u00a0Customers don't count with Bank of America.","553":"I've had my Bank of America Credit Card for almost four years. I haven't had any problems with it. The fees and rates are fair. I try to make my payments on time and their grace periods are really reasonable. I feel like I am contacted by Bank of America a lot more than other credit card companies. They try to sell me different things, such as additional protection, upgrades, etc. via email and the phone. It's kind of annoying but I've learned to ignore it. Overall though, my experience with Bank of America has been fair. I shop, they pay, then I pay them back!","556":"This was the first credit card that I have ever received. It was a pleasant surprise to actually be approved for the card in the first place seeing that I was a new college student with no prior credit, and to make matters worse it was shortly after the economic collapse and no one was really giving out credit.After receiving the card it was everything that I could have asked for. I was started on a basic 500$ limit, which was all that I was really looking for. I also did have a points based reward program which turned out to be very beneficial. Every experience with Bank of America has been positive, and there is really nothing negative that I could say.","1107":"This is by far the best credit card I've ever had. The rewards program is straightforward, and earning rewards is easy. They start you off with a $100 bonus once you've spent a total of $500 on the card. You also get 1% cash back on all purchases except for groceries and gas, for which you get 2% and 3% respectively. I try not to use credit cards for those things, but when I have a bad month and have no other options, it's nice to know that I'll at least be getting a portion of it back.The best part is all the options you have for redeeming your rewards. Most card issuers make you redeem for airline tickets, gift cards or lame prizes, but not Bank of America. They give you real, actual CASH back. Once you've accumulated a minimum of $25, you can have your rewards balance transferred to your bank account or request a check. Or if you prefer, you can have it credited to your Bank of America credit card or mortgage balance.I highly recommend this card!","1100":"This is one of Bank of America's best rewards cards on the market. I find the rewards add up fast and you can redeem them for relevant. The negative part of the card is that it is from Bank of America. Of all the banks I have had the most issues with Bank of America over the years. I find their customer service to be lacking and their business practices leave something to be desired. I have not encountered a problem with this particular card yet though so maybe it is better. If you have a good relationship with Bank of America then this card is worth your time for the points.","1102":"I've had this credit card for a few years now and was instantly approved. I had a rather low credit limit and its rates aren't that great compared to other cards. I paid it off immediately and never ran into any trouble. I much prefer my debit card to credit cards in general. This card has no rewards and no real benfit of using it over my debit card. I never make purchases if I don't have the funds. When my credit card expired they did not send me a replacement, I had to go to bank of america and and request a new card and was charged $5. Its a decent basic credit card and does what it needs to.","1103":"I actually started out with a student card back when I opened an account with Bank of America about 4 or 5 years ago before moving to this one. I really like the rewards system as I can get extra cash just through normal usage of the card, which helps out when I'm in a tight spot. At times I forget and then find that I've accumulated enough points for a payout ($25 in rewards in this case), so it's a bit like finding forgotten money lying around the house. I always make sure I completely pay the card off to maintain a good credit score, and because of course interest makes it more expensive in the long run. I haven't had any problems thus far with the service, and overall am pretty satisfied, though I can't make any comparisons to other cards since I have no experience with them.","1104":"I have had this credit card with Bank of America for almost about 4 years now. I have had this credit card with Bank of America for almost about 4 years now. I got it because I was already banking with them and I didn\u2019t like my Capital One card anymore (there was a problem with the online billing). The 0% intro rate is great; I used it to pay for my car, car insurance bills, college tuition, and other recurring bills to build up my credit. They notify me almost immediately by phone and email when there is suspicious activity on my card, and it saved me a lot of money and they sent me a new card in no time when my old one got stolen, great customer support, too.","1105":"I got this card because of the initial $100.00 rewards, as well as the offer for 0% on purchases for up to 12 months. I had to make a big purchase so I figured it would be worth opening up the account. I already have savings and checking with Bank of America, so I wasn't worried about giving their card a try. The 3-2-1 is definitely cool; however, just as with all credit cards make sure you pay your balance in full otherwise your cash back will be worth nothing. I'm not quite sure how other cash back cards work, but you can only cash out in increments of $25.00. That to me doesn't seem fair as they are offering a reward with a catch. It is definitely a card worth the rewards if you can pay it off each month and if you use it EXCLUSIVELY. If you are planning on having this card as a back up, or just another card, probably not worth signing up.","1106":"I got this card because of the term accelerated rewards... that is a joke. However, it's a credit card, you can't expect everything. You charge things, you pay for them. The interest rate is decent, it goes by your credit. The better your credit the batter your interest rate. I have only had to talk to customer service a handful of time for random questions but never for anything serious. I have gotten a credit line increase one time. Which is more than I really needed. I am happy with this card, It does not have an annual fee like most of them do.","1108":"I have had this credit card since 2002 and highly recommend it. I have received awards such as On Board Credits that are applied to my NCL reservations, credits for casino play and money transferred to my checking account. There has never been any problems getting these awards. You can also obtain these Worldpoints through online purchases through a special website, which offers bonus points for shopping at certain merchants. If you have Bank of America, when you log-in to your online account you will be able to see this cards status as well. My interest rate is below those posted here, 9.99% but I have never missed a payment. This card is great to get extra perks on well deserved NCL cruises!","1109":"I love this credit card for a bunch of reasons. I really enjoy cruises and obviously it's way better to get points to earn for on board expenses, upgrade your room, and to try to get a free cruise. This cruise credit card is the BEST dollars spent to point system (I did my research), which is great because I love cruising on NCL. I like to make large group purchases with friends to earn the credits and have them repay me. The only drawback is you can only earn a free cruise to certain areas (the Bahamas, etc) but you really can't complain with a free cruise. It accumulates WAY faster than you ever expect, I really love this card and the benefits!","1120":"I signed up for this credit card when I was right out of high school. It was easily achievable as it was with the bank I currently had (Bank of America). It had a low limit aimed at young teens\/adults so it suited as a starting credit card. I believe the starting limit was 500$ to get me going. Although the card was nothing special, it did have a point-based reward system that allowed me to enjoy using it. I used the points I accrued over the years to purchase an iPad case\/keyboard that works wonderfully and was free so that is a definite plus to this card. I would much prefer a cashback bonus as opposed to reward points but for this card approval rate and ease of use (online managing), it served it's purpose well. I would definitely recommend this card to people who need a reliable and easy card.","1101":"This was the first credit card I've ever owned. As a college student, I thought it would be a good idea to build some credit before I graduated and hit the real world. The rewards, while generous for the first $1500 you spend, are reduced to 1% afterwards. So you get a good positive reinforcement when you first start use card (albeit responsibly, paying off the card on time every month), but then after you end up being like \"where's the cash rewards?\" Also, applying and getting approved for more credit is so easy, it's almost scary.The only complaint I would have is that the card is not travel-friendly. I didn't realize this until I traveled abroad: it does come with a significant fee of about 3% for every international transaction you make. So if you study abroad or travel, I would recommend using a different card, because I racked up about $200 in fees.Overall, a good card for domestic use.","554":"This card is fantastic. I got it in 2004. It was my first credit and I just graduated high school. I used it to pay for all my big important purchases such as tuition, books, and computers. Some of it's programs aren't that great but still gave some kickbacks. I've been using it to build credit throughout college. I don't go anywhere without this and my debit card. This card has gotten me through some tough times over the past years, and for that I am grateful. It's lasted me through college and I will keep using it currently. I would recommend this card.","555":"I love using this card mainly because Bank of America's online management system is very good. I don't have enough experience with the online management systems of other banks to say how they compare, but with BoA it's convenient to see how much money you have in your accounts listed right next to how much you have spent with this credit card. This helps me keep my spending under control and my financial affairs in perfect order. As a recently fiscally-independent young adult, this takes a lot of stress off my mind. For me, using this credit card is the same as using my debit card because it feels like I'm drawing money from MY ACCOUNT (and not putting it on someone else's ledger) and I have yet to carry a balance. The extra advantage of using credit over debit is that I earn points on my purchases. BoA's rewards system seems pretty standard, and so far I have only exchanged my points for cash, which worked well and was a good experience.","557":"I use this credit card for a lot of things. I do this because I figure, if I have to pay for something, I might as well make points while I'm at it. The interest rate is average for a credit card. The Internet site that goes along with it is really user friendly. I recommend this card. I have made enough points to purchase several Amazon.com gift cards, which come in handy during Christmas time. You really are not going to find a better credit card than this one \u2013 it does all that I need my credit card to do.","558":"I've had this card for about 4 yeas now and I have never had issues with it. I love bank of america because there are so many places I can go and use it at. It was very cheap so that is always good as well! I would have no problem recommending this card to anyone I have never had second thoughts with this card. I am in love. they sent me a new one when I lost mine, for free! I was extra shocked. It does what it said it would do and nothing more nothing less. If you need a card that is really reliable I would recommend this one.","559":"I started out getting an Anne Geddes rewards visa through Bank of America (mostly because I wanted a card with the cute baby on it)back in 2006, but it was changed to a regular BofA card when they stopped the Anne Geddes program, and I had that for several years.Recently, I had gone into a bank branch to change my name on my accounts, and the customer service rep said she had noticed I had the BankAmericard rewards card and asked how I liked it. I replied that I didn't know I had it, and she suggested I contact someone either on the phone or online for more information (and I needed to anyway, to change my name) so I got home and called, the rep told me that I didn't have the rewards card, but he could easily switch my card so I did have them. I accepted and within a week I had the rewards card in hand. I love the added ability to earn cash back for just making purchases that I do anyway, and having the ability to redeem my rewards directly to my checking or savings accounts makes it very convenient for me.This card is another great example of how BofA just does things better, better customer service, better rewards, better all around!","1121":"I applied for my first mortgage in 2010. The mortgage officer I spoke with on the phone was very helpful in explaining all of the different terms associated with a mortgage. He gave me all of his contact information and was quick to reply to any small question I had. He was very patient in helping me figure out if a home would be in my budget or not and helped me get prepared for the processing of my mortgage. He referred me to another department and I was also treated very well there. I was given lots of guidance of the type of paperwork I was supposed to submit and she was very patient with me getting it all together. She was very good about getting me prepared for my closing especially making sure I knew how much money to have on hand. Since my closing I've had my mortgage with Bank of America for 2 years. During this time I've called in to see about refinancing, equity, escrow, or changes in my bill and any person I've spoke with is very interested in helping you out and making sure you are in a beneficial position financially.","1122":"The first condo that we bought has a mortgage through Bank of America. There have been good times, and times that have not been so good. I wanted to wait to post my review until we had some resolution to our situation, and now that has come to pass. Initially, we bought out condo when the market was going crazy (2007). As a result, we bought much MUCH higher than we should have. Since then, life happened, and we needed to move to something bigger. We put our condo on the market in 2010 and it took nearly 2 years to sell. Now, while we had the mortgage and were living in the condo we had no problems with Bank of America. However, once we tried to sell the condo we ran in to some serious issues. Over the course of 2 years we had 2 people willing to buy our condo above the current market value, but Bank of America was unwilling to do a short sale. Unfortunately, there was no way we could make the monthly payment and there was NO way somebody would be able to pay for the entire mortgage that was left. They seemed unwilling to work with us. We went to a branch to talk to somebody, but the information wasn't passed along to the mortgage department. They were unwilling to work with us until now, and at this time we're working with a representative to complete a final short sale. It has been a long and tiring experience, but I'm sure experiences like this does not lie only with Bank of America. I can't recommend them explicitly, but I wouldn't turn anyone away from using them for their own mortgage.","1123":"I use the Bank of America Cash Rewards card as my main credit card. My wife and I have a shared account so every charge we make with this card results in cash back for us.This card provides at least 1% back on every purchase, while also giving 2% back on groceries, and 3% back on gas. As my wife and I both commute a healthy distance for work, the 3% back on gas is great. This cash back is ours to keep -- there are no fees associated with this card that would subtract from the rewards.It works especially well if you have a Bank of America checking\/savings account, as we do. This gives an extra 10% of the rewards you earn each month, as long as you have the rewards deposited automatically into your account. This is a good deal as I don't know why you wouldn't want the funds in your account anyways.As with other cash back cards, this works best if you pay off the balance in full every month. That way you won't be hit with any interest charges, and everything you earn is just free money for making purchases as you normally would.","1124":"A couple of weeks after I graduated high school, I got a call from Bank of America telling me that I was approved for this credit card. I had needed a few supplies for college that fall so I took them up on their offer. They originally gave me a credit line of $500 and after I paid my bill on time for a few months, they raised my limit to $1000. By the time I was done with my first year of college, I had a credit limit of $1500. This came in handy for purchasing text books and supplies. When I ended up losing my job, Bank of America worked with me on a payment plan. Their customer service representatives are always very helpful. This is the best credit card I have ever used.","1125":"This card sounds like a great product by name, but the truth is it lacks in a lot of ways. The accelerated rewards does not really exist as my other cards far out perform in earning rewards and I spend the same amount on them. With the reward aspect not being a good draw you are now left with Bank of America being your draw, and again this falls short. Bank of America is good for small question and issues, but in the end they do whatever is best for them and don't look out for you as the card holder. I would recommend staying away from this card as you can find much better banks and rewards on the market.","3521":"BANK OF AMERICA IS THE WORST BANK KNOWN TO MA THIS BANK IS HORRIBLE I CANNOT BELIEVE THEY ARE STILL IN BUSINESS. CLOSED AN ACCOUNT OVER THREE YEARS AGO AND HAD TOHIRE A LAWYER TO GET $800 THAT WAS IN ACCOUNT WHEN CLOSED. THEY DONT KNOW HOW TO SPEAK TO PEOPLE AND UNHELPFUL IS THE UNDERSTATEMENT OF THE CENTURY. I ALSO HAD A LARGE CHECK FROMA SETTLEMENT AND EVEN THOUGH IT WAS DRAWN TO BOA, THEY REFUSED TO CASH IT, SAYING THEY DIDNT HAVE THAT AMOUNT. THEY SIMPLY DIDNT CASH IT BECUASE I HAVE TATTOOS AND APPEAR YOUNG. I AM NOT YOUNG, NOT NAIVE AND WILL TARNISH THEIR NAME AT ALL COSTS. THEY HAEV THE ABSOLUTE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ARE A DISPICABLE EXCUSE FOR A BANK. WHETHER YOU ARE LOOKING TO OPEN PERSONAL OR BUSINESS ACCOUNT, I URGE YOU NEVER TO GIVE THEM A PENNY OF YOUR MONEY. THEY SHOULD BE REPORTED ON SO MANY LEVELS....","1127":"I got this card after my first year in college. I found it to be a great credit card to start one\u2019s credit rating. The late fee is a bit too high for my taste but it does serve as a great reminder to pay my bills in time. The cash back bonus also serves as somewhat of an incentive for frequent shoppers, I myself do not have many bills at this time so that feature is not very useful for me. The purchase replacement feature sounds amazing but I\u2019ve never gotten anything stolen yet (knock on wood that it stays that way! :D )","1126":"I recently got this card and I love it. The greatest thing about it is probably the cash rewards on gas transactions! I always buy all of my gas with this card and get 3% back! Plus you also get cash rewards on groceries and everything else.This card also has some really great perks like special offers and bonuses. I find this card to be perfectly handy so long as you pay it off completely every month otherwise the interest charges start kicking in and that's no fun.In conclusion, I find this credit card to be a very good one and I plan to continue using it mainly on my gas purchases as well as groceries and other things occasionally. Ultimately, the point is to use it adequately, while still being able to pay it off at the end of the month.","1128":"I first started out as using Bank of America just for my checkings account. I was in college and actually wanted to start to build up my credit and was able to get this card. I was at first specticle about gettting a credit card thinking that somehow the payments and terms would be too much, but that's not the case with this BoA Visa. It comes in handy for the little things I need (in between paychecks) and fully serves its purpose and then some because of the cash back on things like groceries. I am also able to build credit which is great. I am still a loyal customer and I have been out of school for quite some time. The customer service is great and it was super easy paying the bill online. I say go for it.","1930":"My primary reason for getting this card was to rebuild my credit while attending grad school. Also, I earned $100 cash for my first $100 in purchases as an introductory bonus. As a student, I have benefited tremendously from this card\u2019s \u201ccash rewards\u201d program. I use the card for my gas, food, and other miscellaneous expenses that qualify for cash back. Because the interest rate is substantial, I pay off the balance in full each month to prevent interest accumulation. Another great feature of this card is you earn a 10% cash back bonus for being a BOA checking\/savings account holder. As long as you are responsible with charging and paying your bills, I feel this is a great card for students.","1129":"I've used this card for about six and a half months, and have had no problems thus far. I use it mostly to pay bills, so I haven't been able to take advantage of the rewards program on things such as gas, food, etc, but I plan on changing that very shortly so I can earn more cash back. I was late on a payment one time, which resulted in a high fee, but I guess that is my fault for paying late. I've called customer service one time and had and excellent experience with the representative. Overall, I would recommend this card to everyone!","2212":"I have been with this bank for over five years now and, for the most part, I have received good service. Whenever I call to remedy an issue, representatives are polite and helpful. The online banking is streamlined and efficient, making it easy for me to access my accounts on the go, as well as allowing me to transfer money without an ATM. Meanwhile, there are many ATM locations in the area where I live, so I do not have a problem getting cash when needed. My one complaint is that the one time I overdrew my account when I was less careful, I did not receive notification and was issued a number of charges. This was of course my fault but when I called most of the fees were waived as it was my first time. The bank has since instated overdraft protection so I would receive notice if I were to overdraw and wouldn't automatically be charged $35.","2215":"I became a Bank of America customer when I was added to a joint account with my husband. I had always heard about people having problems with them so I never really tried them out until about six or seven years ago. As long as you had no checks from different states or tax returns that you wanted to see right away, then Bank of America was a perfect bank.We did have an issue with them once after depositing a rather nice bonus check that cleared the next business day. We started to use the money as it was available to use. A couple of days later they took the check out and claimed they had to hold it for 10 days before letting the funds clear. This ended in many unavailable fees and in the end, they would only refund half of those fees. That turned us off from using them and we switched banks.","2216":"I have been banking with Bank of America for 3 years now. I find that Bank of America has good customer service and are always there to help you in anyway possible. The banks are always clean and well lit and the people are very friendly. Bank of America has online services which are very handy and reliable. The bank does not do a very good job of notifying you of what is going on within your account. My years with Bank of America have been overall a great experience. Also the ATM machines offer a lot of services for your account.","1939":"I really enjoy using my Bank of America checking account. I signed up for the e-checking which is free as long as I don't go in and use any teller services for deposits and withdrawals. I have no problem with that at all, especially since I am able to deposit cash directly at the ATM which goes straight into my account. It is very quick and easy to deposit the money and just as easy to make any withdrawals. The online banking is very informational and accurate every time I check. It does take a little bit longer for anything run as credit to show as a withdrawal from the account, but I just have to keep in mind what I spend.","1938":"I have had a credit card with Bank of America since they bought out MBNA America several years ago. I have had a mostly positive experience with the card. I like the convenience of online banking with it as well. I can easily transfer money in from my checking account, and set up alerts for when my balance gets too high or my bill is near due. The interest is kind of high, but no higher than most other credit cards on the market, and it is no problem if you can pay your balance off in full every month.","1937":"I had a Bank of America checking account and credit card all through college, and for the most part they served me well. Customer service was good, and any issues I had were quickly resolved by them. The only reason I left them was because of their proposed $5\/month fee for their checking accounts. I have to say, though, when I did close my account, the people at the bank gave me a really hard time about it, and were actually pretty rude.","1936":"I have been a customer for Bank of America for about 8 years now, and its been good over all, a lot has changed since the first time I opened my account. I really like the keep the change feature, which means that every time you use your debit card you get the difference deposited to your savings account, so far I have saved over $500 just for using my debit card. Customer service is exceptional, I have never had any issues, every time there is irregularity in my account I get a call and a text message verifying that I made that particular transaction which gives me great peace of mind .","1935":"I love Bank of America. I use there online banking known as e-banking. It is the absolute best. It was the account type that worked best for me. When I went to cash my check the teller warned me of the fees I would be charged if I had her process my check since I have an online only account. She directed me to use the ATM to avoid fees. I thought it was great customer service and I appreciated not having any fees! I also enjoy their programs like keep the change. That change really adds up and is good for those terrible at saving, like me. Bank of America automatically does it for you.","1934":"Applying for a mortgage for the first time was one of the most nerve wracking experiences that I have ever had. However my banker, Tricia at Bank of America made the process as painless as possible. She met with me for over two hours the first time that I went in and explained the whole process to me in great detail from the beginning steps to the day I moved into my new home. I often had questions or concerns throughout the process and she was always available either by phone or email or in person to help me address what ever I was unsure of. She helped me secure all of the necessary paper work and documents that I would need and even got me a great interest rate!!! I know that she was just doing her job, but time and time again I have had great customer service from Bank of America employees. They always go above and beyond to make you feel as though your goals are their goals too. Great bank!","1931":"I have a checking account with Bank of America. I have been banking at Bank of America for over 5 years now, and have been content so far. Bank of America provides a very extensive list of services at many locations, such as ATMs and branches. In addition, the services are usually very reliable and convenient. The local branch customer service representatives are always very friendly and very useful. In fact after I lost my debit card, I was quickly able to receive a temporary card, while waiting for the replacement. The online banking they offer is great, reviewing transactions or finding information is easy to do. In short, it has been a very positive experience, doing business with Bank of America.","1932":"I've had a Bank of America credit card for at least 5 years now. It's currently a Platinum Plus card, I'm not sure if it always went by that name though. I have never had any issues with my account, although I've also never paid late, gone over the limit, or anything else like that. This is my main credit card that I use, since although it has a lower limit than many of my other cards, it has the lowest interest rate and a rewards program. It has periods where certain purchases get you more points, but since I only use credit cards for emergencies and things that will get reimbursed from my job I don't really pay attention to it and just let whatever points I end up setting accrue and use them for a $50 gift whenever I have enough for one. The on-line banking is organized well, and I have yet to hit a limit on how many payments I can make on my balance in a month, which is nice since some other companies do cap the number of payments and I tend to make lots of small payments each month as each reimbursement comes in.","2210":"As a checking\/savings (and former credit card) account customer, I only have one major issue with Bank of America, otherwise they'd receive a 5\/5.Listing the positives:1.) When they're being nice; I have immediate access to all information regarding my account,electronically. All debits and potential debits are listed, immediately. Pendingtransactions are listed and my visible available balance reflects the impending debit.2.) Generally, all checks, personal or business, are added to my available balance upondeposit. No wait time.3.) Transfers of money from Pay Pal to my checking account often take less thana full business day. More often, no more than one business day.4.) Staff at branches I've visited have almost always been absolutely efficient andhelpful. Although I understand their main job is that of a sales-person; they'vealways taken a serious interest in my actual needs. They've gone out of the wayto adjust excessive penalties and to assist in international wire transfers (somethingthe US banking system likes to make difficult in most circumstances).My one negative:BOA, like other banks have a nasty practice involving disappearing debits that re-appear in bulk if you make the mistake of keeping less than two hundred dollars in your account for a month. Literally, debits will disappear from your electronic banking statement, and reappear again later. The goal is to trickthe customer into trusting that their available balance is up to date and to overspend, triggering overdraft fees.This practice is currently legal, and, as an aside, it's really up to the customer to keep track of their own spending. Online banking is brilliant however, and performance would be consistent if it wasn't for intentional and irritating practices.","1933":"I'm usually very cautious about doing business with larger banks, but Bank of America is the exception that I am glad that I took. While my local branch does tend to get a bit crowded, the employees of the bank have always been friendly. I have only had one issue with the bank, but that same issue was resolved by the end of the day.I did see a bit of an issue with the bank when it was contemplating adding additional monthly fees for checking accounts. It's more convenient for me to have a checking account with them because the only branch in my city is located around the corner from my house. However, my customer service representative was able to address a few of my questions and ease my concerns.The only other downside I can see to banking with them is the lack of available branches. The city that I live in only has one location. Most of my banking is done electronically so the issue is not huge. However, the times that I do have to go into the bank are usually extended due to somewhat longer lines. However, most of the questions that I've had were able to be addressed by customer service representatives over the phone.","2211":"I had a checking account with Bank of America for several years, and I ultimately ended up switching to a smaller, local bank. It was easy to get started with this bank, but it was not easy to get a real person to address my concerns. This bank is so large that it does not treat its customers like individuals. Their phone system was frustrating because it was hard to get a real person. I did appreciate the fact that their ATM machines were plentiful. I liked some features of their online banking, but in the end I decided that I needed a bank with better customer service.","2214":"I got this card to help me with a large balance I had on another credit card and took advantage of the 0% balance transfer rate. Mine was 12 months at the time, and helped me relieve some of the stress from the situation and get me back on my feet.Since then, I've kept the card but have used it sparingly as I have other cards that offer much better rates and rewards than the Bank of America Platinum Plus.The Platinum Plus does offer rewards, but I've found myself having trouble getting to the minimum amount of points for anything that I desire.The greatest benefit from this card has been to my credit score. Having cards that require high credit scores seem to increase the credit score even more, for which I am very grateful.","2213":"I have been with BofA for a few months now. I decided to apply online for a savings account. It only took a couple days to be approved. Afterwards, I quickly received my PIN. Then, I received my card just a day later.I get money orders from my job so Bank of America has been very helpful. When I go inside of the branch, the line is short and the faculty is exceptionally helpful and nice. They always tell me about current promotions and any other services that may be useful to me. When I have any questions I receive correct and detailed answers.The Bank of America ATM's are also very convenient in withdrawing any money I need. They even have an instant cash deposit option which is new for me. But, it definitely makes deposits after hours extremely convenient. And, the money is available instantly.My Grandma also uses this bank and has for many many years. This is why I initially picked this bank.All in all I would recommend this bank to anyone who is looking for an account. I will soon be getting a checking account also.","2217":"I have been both a business and personal banking customer of Bank of America for more than 3 years. They are very professional and courteous, always eager to resolve your problem as soon as possible whether it is over the telephone, online via chat or in person. Recently, I had a problem with a transaction on my account in which I was charged a fee in error but after speaking with a supervisor, the problem was resolved in a friendly and professional manner. Another thing that impresses me about Bank of America is how they really take care of their business customers, whether small or medium size, they make us feel really important and pleased to affiliate ourselves with them. They make it quite easy to bank with them no matter the time of the day.","2218":"With the expenses of school going up and up and with no time to work and study, I decided to take out some personal loans at Bank of America after a fellow classmate recommend it to me. When I first got to the door, the customer service employee was very courteous and made sure that I would be helped soon despite the amount of people that were at the bank at the time. After only waiting for a few minutes, an employee came over and asked me what I needed help with. I explained to him my situation and he was more than helpful in assisting me. He told me all the ins and outs of my personal loan and answered all my questions clearly. Instead of pressuring me into signing a deal I wasn't prepared for, he told me to take a couple of days to think about it and he would help me whenever I was ready. That made me feel really at ease and I am glad I ended up going with Bank of America. I haven't had any problems yet and the entire process has only been a plus for me.","2219":"Bank of America is amazing. I signed up for their e checking account. This is a totally paperless checking account, which is really convenient for me. I'm really glad that they offer this environmentally friendly option. The best part about it is that the account is completely fee free. Bank of America has ATM machines right on my college campus, which is really nice. And Bank of America pretty much has ATM machines everywhere so it's convenient for everyone. I haven't experienced any problems with them yet. Their application was online, which made it quick and easy for me to fill out. Overall, Bank of America is the best bank that I have ever used.","1770":"I have been banking with Bank of America for about two years and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have anything but positive things to say about their banking practices and customer appreciation. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always felt more comfortable with bigger banks opposed to the smaller community banks. Bank of America offers that one on one individual appreciation which I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always encountered at my local branch with the backing of a big name behind it. The customer service is outstanding and at my local branch in Grand Rapids, Michigan a couple of the tellers even know me by name.My interest was first aroused with Bank of America through their exquisite student checking that they offer for students. If I signed up for an account I would get a $100 cash offer which would be deposited into my account after six weeks (and it was.) Free money is always good! Bank of America offers a great overall eBanking but the one for their students as well as the free money that I got is what sealed the deal for me. My student eBanking includes free transfers which is great!!!! I can easily transfer money between my Bank of America account to my PayPal account. I love buying and selling things on eBay and this transfer makes the process so much easier especially since the transfers are always free. That is a really rarity in banking. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m also an Economics major and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a free MyPortfolio that comes with my account which has been both fun and a learning experience. I get to play with the financial market and stock options, which will be crucial in my future.The customer service is unrivaled. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never banked with any other institutions so I cannot compare Bank of America to other banks but I can base their customer service on other companies that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve dealt with and I can honestly say that the representatives at Bank of America are concerned about their customers. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never had any bad incidents where a teller or a representative was short with me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always walked out satisfied. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve also got a great phone system and the representatives are just as friendly!Bank of America probably has just about as many ATM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s around as Chase Bank. An abundance of ATM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is a big plus for me. I travel back and forth between Chicago and Grand Rapids a lot. I never carry cash with me so stopping at an ATM is almost a daily thing for me. Since there are so many Bank of America ATM\u00e2\u0080\u0099s around, I rarely have to use another ATM which charges outrageous fees just to withdraw money.I would recommend Bank of America to anyone but particularly students. Students often have limited choices it seems but at Bank of America the options are awesome as well as extra banking options like free money transfers and my favorite tool; the MyPortfolio option. The application process is easy to, you can just do that online.","1041":"No offense to Bank of America, but out all of the banks I\u2019ve invested my money in, they have the most incompetent, unprofessional and condescending customer service representatives that I have ever encountered. I was waiting to speak to a bank representative for at least 40 minutes, and when I did finally get to speak to one, they were very rude and condescending as if they didn\u2019t want or need my service. When I told the representative that I was very interested in a checking account with the bank, she did not make me feel like my money was welcome. I was very offended but I decided to bank with them anyway, because of the special they were having. I ended up closing my account, withdrawing all of my money from the bank and having an experience to write about that is not of favor of banking with them.","1042":"My experience here was very rewarding and it was very easy for me to open a checking account in my location. They made sure that they choose the best type of account for me, that worked for the amount of money I make, and also based on how much I will deposit each month. The guy that helped me through this process was very knowledgeable and savvy. They also make sure to contact you through the phone if there is something fishy happening in your account. I love this, since it makes me feel more protected and secure. I have already recommended this bank to my friends and family, and will be using this bank for the future.","1775":"My branch of Bank of America is wonderful! In the 10+ years I have been banking with them, I have never had an issue that they weren't quick to resolve, including opening accounts for my children and having power of trust for my mother's accounts, and having the random deposit bounce, etc....Last week I got a call from the bank manager who told me that another customer had found my wallet on the street and had turned it into the bank. It would have been easy for her to put in it their lost and found or to put it in the mail, but she made the effort to call me and within minutes I had my wallet again.Another time, when I was in the branch I had a new photo taken for my debit card and the manager allowed my (then) 5 year old son to take the photo. It's this kind of friendliness and customer service that goes the extra mile and makes me keep my primary checking account with B of A.","1774":"I have been a Bank of America member for almost eight years. Throughout that time, I have had my fair share of issues with the bank itself. There have been fees that were charged for things I did not do, payments taken out when they shouldn't have been, and sometimes bad customer service. However, I have recently began using this bank again, and I now love it! I love that I can always find a Bank of America, so it is very convenient. I have also had much better experiences with the staff in the last six months. All in all, I really enjoy using Bank of America.","1778":"I have been banking with Bank of America for the past 8 years and I have never had any problems. All of the people that work there are friendly and they have come to know me by name. Many people believe that you cannot get good service at a larger bank, but that is definitely not true. It all depends on the people, and I have not run into any that I have a problem with. It is also good to be able to find an ATM whenever I need it in order to avoid using other bank's ATMs and paying extra fees.","1771":"I have been with Bank of America for more than 10 years now and have had no issues with them. I opened a bank account with them during college to take advantage of the college checking plan they offer. They have banks located everywhere and the staff on location and on the phone are very helpful! Just about a week ago I had an issue with my online banking account and the phone representative was very quick and sincere in her helping me out. I also am enrolled in the keep the change program which offers an easy and think free way to save money on every purchase I make. Thanks for the past ten years Bank of America!","1779":"I have heard so many bad reviews about BOA and I can tell from experience that they really are. I just got off the phone with them and I can not wait to share my bad experience with them. This customer reputation by the name of Bella was so rude, unprofessional and condescending over the phone. They need to train their customer service reputation on how to handle each calls well. I am glad I closed my account with them. I am sure there are other good banks there that takes care of their customers.Bank teller said that a credit card had no annual fee if I also had a checking account. Later, an annual fee was charged. When I called him, he said that it turned out that my particular checking account was not eligible for this.New federal laws prevent you from receiving overdraft fees if you do not opt in. However, they circumvent you by still charging a \"non-sufficient funds fee\" even though the transaction goes through.","12":"Took out a car loan with them about 4 years ago. I am currently in my last year of payments. The application process took about 2 hours and I had the cash for the car within 1 business day. Making the payments and keeping track of the account is very simple, as the online website is amazing. I don't have other accounts with this bank, but speaking solely from getting a car loan the process was very quick and easy and the maintenance of the account has been great. Customer service has also always been able to answer any and all questions I've had regarding the account.","11":"I had this bank for 2 years before I decided to go to someone else. It seems like after 2005 they started taking their customers for granted. I went to few branches and their customer service was awful. One time I had few charges from them and I wanted to clarify it but they couldn't figure out how I got the charges nor would they return them. One time I had a scammer who was taking money from my account and I asked them to trace it but they couldn't even do that form. At that moment I got fed up and decided to change the bank. It used to be great bank but somehow it has changed.","10":"I've been with Bank of America most of my adult life. When I first started working, I set up an account first with a local bank but was not happy with their online access. So, I canceled my account with them and set up at BoA. Every time I have had a problem, they have resolved it quickly. When I have asked for an allowance for an over draw, they have worked with me on the issue. It has always been a delight banking with them. They talk to me respectfully and even just talk without just trying to get me off the phone or out of their face as quick as possible. I've had a decent conversation with them as the computers processed my request. They are always willing to work with me no matter the issue. All in all, I don't think I'll ever leave them.","1040":"I switched to Bank of America after my Well's Fargo debit card was stolen. Well's Fargo's customer service after the incident was horrible and after a month I still had not received a replacement debit card. I switched to Bank of America and am glad I did. It's been 3 years now and they have been very accommodating to my needs.I have only had one issue, which they did resolve. Someone wrote me a bad check and I was charged a fee for depositing it. I felt this was unfair as the person who wrote the bounced check should have been charged. I called customer service and they reversed the charge and had clear advice on how to avoid it in the future--my client was also a BoA customer so they told me to always cash the check first and then deposit it.Overall, I have been given good service and am happy. I wish that there were no ATM fees at other banks as I often am not near a BoA ATM but this is a minor detail.In the future, if any other issues arise I may switch to a credit union, but for now I am satisfied.","1777":"Recently, I had to take out a loan because my car's transmission was going out. I had been a customer of Bank of America for only a few months, but I found that the approval process was rather smooth, as compared to other locations that I've banked with. The customer service was excellent, and the employee, Becky, was more than willing to provide me will all of the information I needed to make my correct loan choice.I found that the interest rate for a loan of 6k was more than competitive, so we finished the paperwork and I was on my way. I was able to pay the loan off quickly, and Bank of America was always one phone call or email away to answer any questions I had about the monthly payments and future loan processing. I highly recommend Bank of America to others.","1776":"I have been banking for about 15 years now and in all of this time I have only used four banks. The worst experience I have ever had has been with Bank of America. I had been a customer with them for more than two years when I went to deposit my check and found my account had been overdrawn by more than 500 dollars. I was shocked since I had checked my balance the day before and found that I still had 32 dollars remaining and had only used 11 dollars to put gas in my car. When I called the bank they said that 200 dollars had been pulled out of my account via an ATM in a town that is a four hour drive from my house not once the night before, but twice. Then my gas purchase had gone through and of course the over draft fees were attached. I was horrified and the bank did not seem to understand what I was going through at all. They offered to refund the over draft fees, which was only a total of one 105 dollars leaving me still in the negative over 400 dollars. It took me nearly four months to get the bank to return my money to my account. That is when I closed my account and found a new bank.","1043":"I had a very good experience opening a new checking account with Bank of America. The woman that helped me choose the type of account that was best for me was very informative, friendly, and helpful. She didn't rush me through anything and really took the time to be friendly and make sure I got everything I needed.I felt very welcome and at home. On top of that, the account they set up for me has zero monthly fees and tons of online options and customization. Perhaps my favorite feature is the ability to set up customized alerts to email or text me when various actions take place, from withdrawals, deposits, to alerting me when my account hits a certain low, which is entirely customizable by me.Getting my photo on my Debit card is also a nice added security feature.This was the most peasant experience I've had with a bank to date, and would highly recommend Bank of America to anyone.","1044":"I banked with Bank Of America for 3 years before I left. They were conveniently placed right between my high school and my job. Plus everyone in my family had had them at one time. For the first year everything was great. I got all my direct deposits on time, I had enrolled in Keep The Change and was enjoying that, I also opened a savings account to go along with my checking account.After a year I was approved for 1000 dollar line of credit, after that is when everything went downhill. My credit card got charged for 600 dollars worth of phone cards in Mexico. They were not sure how it happened but they filed a report and said I would be reimbursed for all the fraudulent charges. I was only reimbursed $350. Then there was a teller error and when I went to deposit a check to my account it somehow was sent to someone else's account and it took 21 days for me to get my money back. My checking account also got hacked and cleared out and it took way too long for me to get my money back but even when I did they made me pay the overdraft fees that were accrued.I asked if me getting all my account numbers and card numbers changed would help and i was told over the phone that if i stopped using my stuff online I wouldn't have that problem. I found that extremely rude seeing how at the time I wasn't even comfortable with online shopping.. After all that I decided it would be best to move my money to a different institution.","1045":"I recently made the switch from the larger Bank of America to the smaller and more friendly First Citizens Bank. I didn't make the switch because Bank of America was so terrible, but more for the easy access and free student checking provided by First Citizens. I found my new bank's staff to be much more helpful and open about the policies and fees associated with the different processes I had to go through. I don't recommend Bank of America for anyone who wants a straightforward and no hassle checking experience. The service wasn't terrible, but there are much better places to handle your finances.","1046":"I had recently switched from Bank of America to Wells Fargo for a lot of reasons. I am saddened by the fact that I ever had the displeasure of using this bank. This was one of the worst experiences of my life. First of all, the customer service was awful. They were rude and a little bit disrespectful every time I was there. The next biggest thing: all the hidden fees they gave me. It was starting to get ridiculous. They charge me five dollars here or there for almost no reason at all. I can honestly say that I will avoid this bank at all cost in the future.","1047":"I recently decided to create an account with Bank of America. As I entered the bank to do so, I was greeted by a manager who helpfully asked me which services I needed today, and he was able to direct me to the appropriate area. The wait time was manageable, and I was soon speaking with a representative of the bank who proceeded to assist me with creating my online account. They explained things in an easy-to-understand manner, and were also able to answer any questions that I had. Overall, I would rate my experience with Bank of America as very favorable, and I would encourage others to bank with them.","1048":"I have used Bank of America checking for 4 years. My use of this account is as a go-between for my USAA checking account, since USAA doesn't have a physical presence in my town. So, for cash deposits I tend to use Bank of America and then funnel that money to USAA. Given my use of this account, I often have a zero-balance. Everything was fine for a few years, but then I got a statement in the mail with a balance of -$10. Turns out they had snuck a change in the terms of the account in a previous statement without my knowing. I accept responsibility for not reading all the fine print every month, but I still find it dishonest to be changing what was marketed as a \"Free Checking Account\" to one that requires a monthly \"service charge\" without making a blatant attempt to notify the consumer. This was done sneakily on purpose to make some money.Having said all that, I was able to go down to the local branch and get it straightened out, but not without pressing the issue more than I should have been required to. A less confrontational customer might not have gotten their money back. For this experience I have to downgrade my overall rating of Bank of America Checking to 2-stars. You just can't do this to loyal customers.","1049":"I have a mortgage through BoA and the process itself went very smooth. Everyone was very friendly helpful through out the process. I had one loan officer who would call me from his cell phone and that was nice not to see a bunch of strange numbers coming up from my caller ID. It also made it nice to be able to get a hold of him almost at any time to answer all of my (sometimes silly) questions. The only complaint I would have is that there are not many physical brick and mortar branches in my particular area. I had to drive 1 hour round trip a few times to physically sign something, or have something faxed. Minor things really. Buying a second home was less stressful thanks to BoA.","1773":"I've been using a student checking account at Bank of America for about three years now. They don't reward you with any interest, but otherwise I've been happy with the service provided.I never have to carry any cash with me due to having their debit card, which helps reduce the size of my wallet and makes me feel a bit safer walking around at night.I've had a few instances of having to have my card replaced due to suspected identity theft, which can be a bit of a hassle, but I'd rather be safe than sorry. The other nice thing is that they don't charge you for card replacements.Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with Bank of America.","1772":"Bank of America has lots of things going for it: It's a huge, monolithic corporation. Things are speedy and efficient. What is lost in the shuffle is personal understanding and a human touch. From the ridiculous monthly maintenance fees to the harsh overdraft charges (for a single $3.00 purchase), the entire enterprise smacks of a large, faceless corporate bank that doesn't care about individual customers. If you're looking to open an account with a large national bank, you could certainly do worse than Bank of America. However, it will always feel second-rate due to their dogged adherence to corporate policy and their insistence on bleeding account holders of their precious nickels and dimes.","13":"I like the Bank of America Visa because it's easy to use and gives me good rewards. I earn one point for each dollar I spend and can trade the points in for cash or prizes. I also like the Bank of America Visa credit card because you can personalize them. For example, my credit card has a picture of Hello Kitty on it. The Bank of America Visa credit card is my first credit card ever. I have had it for about four years now and I would not consider changing to a different card. I can use it anywhere and it is very convenient.","2055":"So far, I have switched over to Bank of America checking from Capital One and have been relatively pleased with the service. I like their online checking much more than I did at Capital One; their \"Sitekey\" feature is actually pretty ingenuous at avoiding the most common phishing attempts. The website also seems to include more information about your purchases and programs you have signed up for. Even with programs like Keep The Change, they have told me exactly what goes into savings each time. It's been pretty nice!The one gripe I have is that signing up for a new checking account is supposed to credit you $100 on your signup. I thought I looked over the fine print pretty well at the time, but still somehow missed that you needed to setup a direct deposit with the account in order to get the funds. Considering my employer does not do direct deposit, it seems that I will be missing out. Regardless, they've provided a good service!","14":"I like the Bank of America Visa because it's easy to use and gives me good rewards.

I have had it for about four years now and I would not consider changing to a different card. I can use it anywhere and it is very convenient.","15":"This is a decent card. I got this card my senior year of college and it seemed to work just fine for my needs. I enjoy being able to transfer funds from my bank to my credit card form my checking account via my mobile banking app on my smartphone. It allows me to build credit so when I am out of college I can get an apartment or something. Although I do believe that it needs a grace period because it is made for students trying to build credit. Another criticism I have about this card is that the rates are too high for it being a card for students.","2052":"This is truly a great card! To date, there have not been any issues with my Account in terms of fraudulent charges, timely statements, and timely payment postings. I keep track of all of my purchases through Quicken, and this card is fully compatible with that software. I use this card from paying off utilities to buying candy at the corner store! The interest rate is nice, even though I pay off my Bill every month. Also, I liked the promotion where you got a 25% bonus on your cashback if you deposit it into your BOA. Overall I would say that I am a very satisfied customer.","2054":"We've really enjoyed Bank of America. We've never had any significant problems with their services. Adding a second person to the account was quick and easy, and so was getting another debit card. The online checking system is easy to use and very helpful. The ATMs are very self-contained, and not at all a hassle to use. They have quick withdrawal options to speed along the process, and all depositing is done flawlessly without envelopes. The customer service is very helpful and prompt in getting questions answered. We've never had a long wait time on the phone. I would recommend this bank to anyone!","2051":"I've been using this version of the VISA Credit Card for Bank of America since I began college four years ago. I've never had any problems with it, unless it was caused be me forgetting to pay the bill, or when I lost my card studying abroad.. I usually use it a few times a month just to build up some credit for when I get out of college and am officially on my own. The Bank of America even sent me a new card a month before mine expired which was nice and hassle free. Overall I would recommend using this credit card to other students, but I think adults would be able to find a better deal.","2053":"I have nothing but good things to say about this company! I know that in the past couple of years a lot of bad has been said about its fees and processes, but they have always been fair with me, giving me clear disclosures when there are changes and they always seem to listen to what people have to say about the changes they are planning, which is one reason I intend to stay with them.Another big reason I like this bank is the customer service, both in branch, and online. They are always friendly, knowledgeable and willing to help with whatever situation I have come up with. Most recently, I went through a divorce and went into the branch to get my name changed on my accounts, checking, savings and a credit card. The woman in the branch office was friendly and was able to get the checking and savings accounts taken care of in just a few minutes, and then she advised me how to go about getting the credit card taken care of, and even suggested a new option on the card for me, one where I end up making cash back for my purchases.I have been a customer of Bank of America for over six years now, and fully intend to be one for a long time to come!","19":"I have had this card for a couple of years now and it has really come in handy. The purchase protection is great, I lost a camera while on vacation (I bought it for that vacation) and was able to get replacement camera. Since I have a Bank of America account, I usually transfer my rewards directly to my Bank of America account to get the bonus. I use it for my normal purchases and pay it off right away so it's nice to get bonuses for my normal use. Plus, I prefer to use this card over my debit card in case of fraud, I would rather have to deal with getting the charges reversed on the credit card than having to worry about the money in my checking account being used and having to get that reimbursed.","2050":"I've had only positive experiences with Bank of America, over my past 5 years of banking with them. My most recent experience involved the fact that I accidentally downloaded a computer virus, and I was concerned that my online banking information had been compromised. The customer service representative not only assisted in putting a watch on my account, but gave me further steps to ensure that my information was safe. She was 3 steps ahead of me, which truly enhanced my trust with the bank. My only complaint is that a fee exists if you choose to open a second checking account. There are ways around it (elect not to have money directly deposited), but it does seem a bit unfair to charge an already existing customer more money to open a second checking account. Otherwise, their customer service is impeccable and their online banking (and droid app) work wonderfully.","16":"I first signed up for this card when I went off to college. At first I wasn't able to get it because I had no credit history and I tried applying with my mom, but I was rejected. After a month I reapplied with my dad and that somehow got me the card. The card was really nice for me to build credit. I first used it to make a couple small purchases and I was able to pay the bills on time. After a few months of this, I had a decent credit score. Now I can rest easy knowing that I won't have to rely on my parents too much after I leave college and get my own place.","17":"I've had this credit card for several months and it's come in VERY handy! However, if I don't use it each month, they charge interest. As long as you use it every month and pay it off, you don't really have to worry about the interest. Bank of America has been very helpful and it's always easy to contact someone if I have any questions. Their website makes it SUPER easy to view everything related to my card. I highly recommend this for students just starting out with credit, but remember- PAY IT OFF EVERY MONTH and don't think it gives you money, you're just BORROWING money!","18":"I've had this credit card for a few years now and I've never once had a problem with it. It's functioned exactly like I hoped it would. As long as you stay on top of your payments like I have done the no issues will ever arise. One feature I especially like is the ability to handle payments and notifications online. There is no need to deal with possible human error; everything is clean and simple. I will say that there is not any real incentive to having this card besides its simplicity and decent rates. There is no substantial reward system in place for choosing this card over competitor\u2019s cards. If you are looking for a card that will act the way it\u2019s supposed to and do nothing beyond that, then this card will work just fine.","1581":"My first bank that I ever used was a local credit union from my hometown, but when I moved to go to college far away from home it became impractical to continue to stay with them. I had a job on campus and the paychecks came with the Bank of America logo on them, so I figured that I should consider joining the bank. I went to my local location and they were very helpful with setting up my checking account. While they were very nice they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t offer me any special offers or anything, which is something that I was spoiled by my old bank. For example I used to be refunded for every ATM fee so I could use any ATM I wanted, I wish things like this existed at BOA.","1580":"I've had a student savings and checking account with Bank of America for three years and I'm very satisfied with the entire experience. I've never had to deal with any monthly or hidden fees, or even overdraw fees (and as a broke college student my account is overdrawn a lot!) The online banking is very convenient. It's easy to transfer money between my two accounts, I can even do it from my smartphone. I've also had to change my address three times and report a stolen debit card once and the process is really simple and quick. I'm happy with the customer service I've received both over the phone and in person.","501":"I had been searching around banks looking for a good car loan. It was my first time ever needing a loan for a car so I was a complete amateur. I went to Bank of America and honestly, I was shocked they had the best rates in my area. I have pretty good credit so I did have some pretty awesome interest rates at most places but Bank of America's staff was what made my decision easy. They were so eager to help me and continued to be that way until now. I only have a few payments left on my car and whenever I go make a payment they reassure me that I can always come back for another loan if needed. I had an issue ONE time where I was a couple of days late on a payment and they didn't even hassle me. I went in to make the payment and commented on the fact they weren't harassing me yet and they said they knew I'd be in eventually. Great experience with them and will go back again if the need arises.","1586":"Bank of America is one of the worst banks for a checking account. Hidden fees, poor customer service, and horrible problem resolution are just some of the problems I encountered with them before leaving. My bank was swallowed up by Bank of America so I did not choose to be with them. After three months of poor customer service, fees, and numerous problems, I had to delete my account with them and move to SunTrust. Even after I took my business elsewhere, Bank of America kept calling for at least 6 months trying to get me back and sending me junk mail at least two times a week. I had to call their corporate office to get my name removed from all mailings and phone solicitations.","1587":"The only thing good about BOA is the application process, they'll take anybody but once you have an account the way they treat you changes. Bank of America has changed a lot over the past few years. The customer service at branches in Atlanta are horrible and down right rude. They don't tell you about the hidden costs or fees and constantly refuse to waive them even when they aren't your fault. I spent countless nights on the phone with BOA before I finally decided to move my money else where. They had the nerve to change my account balance, and then fine me for having a low account balance. Well yeah, I had a low balance, because you moved it some where and couldn't tell me where. I know a lot of banks these days are doing odd fees and charges but frankly, BOA isn't worth your time. Go to Wells Fargo, or Chase, or Navy Federal\/USAA if you can!","1585":"I had an account with Bank of America several years ago and I did not like it. I opened an new account with them about two years ago and I've loved it ever since. I can know that the company is listening to their customers due to the changes in policy. The customer service is outstanding and I've had no problems. There was even a time where my employer didn't deposit my check on time, I had payments scheduled to come out and a representative was able to hold two of the transactions to prevent a penalty. That would have never happened before. I just wanted to say thank you for listening and that you now have a long time customer. Thank you.","1584":"I used to be a customer of Bank of America, but had too many problems with them, so I decided to switch to a credit union. My checking account was supposed to be free with a minimum balance of $300, but every few years they would raise the minimum balance without even letting me know. When I contacted customer service they were useless and said there was nothing they could do and never returned my money. After only a few years that $300 minimum balance became a $1500 minimum balance! I had enough when they start charging $14 for a \"monthly maintenance fee\" for nothing. My suggestion is stick to smaller banks or credit unions, because these big banks will rip you off. Bank of America is terrible.","1583":"I have been a Bank of America customer for about 6 years now and I have never had any problems with them whatsoever. They were the first people to approve me for a credit card when I was younger, which is why I have good credit today. Whenever I have had an issue they have been available on the phone, such as when my wallet was stolen about 3 years ago. They immediately took care of it and I knew I didn\u2019t have to worry. They also have made it extremely easy to pay my credit card bill online and I really appreciate that convenience. I would definitely recommend Bank of America to others.","1582":"I had a car loan through Bank of America for about 2 years before I paid it off. My wife and I had absolutely no problems at all until we fully paid off our car. Before we paid off our loan amount, we had our account setup for automatic payments and this ended up hurting us after we paid our account off.Immediately after paying off our account I went to log in to Bank of America's website, but I couldn't get in since I didn't have an 'active' account. I figured everything was fine and I went on my own way. About 3 weeks after we paid off our loan, we were hit with a substantial charge from Bank of America out of our account. Bank of America was still taking out our car payment out of our account automatically even after we had paid off our loan.I contacted BoA's customer support and they were everything but helpful. They told me that I would have to log into my account to make these changes so that they wouldn't keep charging me. When I told them that I can't login because I don't have an 'active' account they told me that I needed to log in anyway.I ended up having to dispute the charge with my local bank (which costs me $30). The charge that BoA charged us fraudulently caused us to go into overdraft at our bank which was a big headache. I had to have our local bank actually put a block on the payments since Bank of America couldn't help with the removal of that charge.This is the only issue that we had with Bank of America. It is a big issue and definitely a major inconvenience. I would use them again, but I would make sure that this issue wouldn't happen again.","500":"My wife and I have been banking with Bank of America for several years. One of the things I like best is that our checking and savings accounts are linked. In the case that an overdraft occurs the shortage amount is transferred from our savings account automatically. The fee for this transfer is much lower than other banks I have used in the past. Another feature I love is ATM checking deposit. The ATM not only scans and deposits the check amount, it will also print a copy of the check on the receipt. That is brilliant! We have been very happy with them and plan to continue using them for years to come.","2057":"I've had my business accounts with Bank of America for about two years now, we already had our business credit cards through them so it made sense to just keep our company dealings with one bank. So far it's actually been really good, no problems to complain about. For whatever reason, I've had two fraud attempts on our accounts in the last year, both times it was caught by Bank of America really fast and they called me immediately. I had to cancel my debit and credit cards and have them replaced which was a major hassle, but this was the fault of the person trying to commit fraud, not the bank's. I'm glad they keep such diligent tabs on accounts, it could have been bad as company payroll would have been wiped out. They get high marks for this reason alone.","502":"I've been banking with Bank of America for 11 months now and so far my experience has been great. I love how easy the online banking. They make checking your balance and doing online bill pay really easy. Bank of America has a lot of ATMs so it's always really easy to find one whenever you need it. I also really like that you can deposit checks at their ATMs. This feature is important to me because I work full time and it's hard for me to get to the bank during the week. Being able to do most of my banking at the ATM is very convenient.When I do go to the branch by me, the costumer service is really great. The people that are there are genuine and helpful. Overall, I highly recommend this bank.","503":"I have been a customer of Bank of America for years and have always had good experiences with them. I normally take out a loan every year around Christmas to get presents for my family and friends and they are always more then willing to work with me despite my limited income. I am always more then satisfied with the deal we come to and I always have the loan paid in time for my next one the following holiday season. The loan officer is always very friendly and makes sure the loan is explained in a way I can understand. I always feel like the bank is working in my best interest and is out for more then my money. I have never had any kind of problems with the loan process. I would recommend a personal loan from this Bank of America to anyone to in need of a loan.","504":"My decision to bank with BofA was based on their student banking option featured on their website. However, it would not allow me to sign up online. I had to go to a branch to get an account. The man who waited on me was very helpful and answered my questions effectively. However, the student banking option did not exist at the branch in which I was highly disappointed. I was also disappointed in not being able to enroll in \"keep the change\" program. Overall, I liked my experience at the branch and the man was very friendly and made me feel comfortable about banking with them.","505":"I love Bank of America! They are so helpful in any situation. I even had a few overdraft fees and they reversed them. They don't charge any fees for services and their checks are so cheap! Their customer service is the best around; I have never met a customer service representative from Bank of America with an attitude. One time I even suffered from identity theft and they were so cautious and helpful regarding my circumstance. They refunded me all of the money that was stolen to me and helped me get set up with a safer account. My only complaint is that there are some places where there are no Banks of America anywhere. My husband is in the army, so I will hate to have to switch to another bank because of location.","506":"As with many big banks, service doesn\u2019t always feel like the banks priority. Bank of America has had its share of bad press in the past few years. While I\u2019m sure those new stories were justified, my experience with the big BoA has been average. By average, I certainly mean not necessarily bad, but not exactly great either. Thankfully, my experience has been limited to only my checking account. Bank of America provides all kinds of incentives and offers the latest in smart phone apps. A big plus for Bank of America is their availability. It\u2019s difficult to not run into one of their ATM\u2019s or locations while you\u2019re traveling. On the negative side however, they don\u2019t treat you fantastically. With smaller\/more local banks begging for your business, it may be wise to look elsewhere.","507":"I first started with Bank of America about 6 yrs ago. I just needed a simple checking account. I guess I chose this bank because it was available and the people seemed very professional and pleasant. Unfortunately, that all changed. I had clearly made a mistake. With my expericene, I felt there were so many hidden fees! Every time I turned around they were raising the fees for this or that. I was trying to save money and I felt like I lost a lot of money with the ridiculous fees! When I would call customer service half time the they didn't even know how to fix a problem forcing me to have to drive to the branch to get answers. I had never once overdrawn my account but still got treated like my account was overdrawn every week.","508":"I have been a Bank of America customer for over a decade and have not had any major problems with them. In fact, I have consistently been impressed with their services and the conveniences they provide. Their online banking and mobile apps are very good, although I wish their app could scan checks like Chase's. I have heard much about many questionable business practices that Bank of America does, but I can't speak upon that. I've never received a loan from them, so I don't know about that either. All I know is that I have a free checking account that has been easy to use and more convenient than any other I've used or even heard about.","509":"Where to start. Bank of America is terrific, absolutely terrific, at making the application and approval process as quick and as simple as possible. After that, though, the whole thing tanks. You can count on everything that you agreed to being amended into something that solely benefits the bank and has no concern for how it may effect you and your credit score. I had taken a personal loan to cover the remaining costs of my final year of college with the intent to pay it off in under 5 years. Needless to say this didn't happen. After approximately 3-6 months of paying on time, my terms and rate were augmented where the payments increased. Luckily, I didn't have too much of an issue with it because I had a good paying job and could handle the change. I have been over paying it off steadily for 5 years with five thousand left on the loan. What changed in the structure of the loan was that since I used the checks they provided and not my own the bank can label the transactions as 'transfer' funds and put a hefty fee and additional interest on the amounts. I called to refinance the loan and they sent me over to an 'independent' debt management company. I signed up with the debt company with their assurance that BoA would agree to the terms and I'd be totally debt free, including outstanding credit cards and the BoA loan, within 4 years. BoA rejected their proposal, I missed a full payment because they took their time in responding so I got a nice $49 fee on top of everything that they already charge me. They string you along with promises of help and punish you for taking their advice. I will never, ever, ever deal with them again.","1589":"My family has been with them for years, since they were Boatmans here in Missouri. But things have changed quite a bit. Hidden fees...horrible foreclosure policies, the list goes on and on. At this point I would honestly say Bank of America is pure evil. The only reason I am still with them is because they are so close to me and I am simply very paranoid about online banking. The fact that I am forced to stick with them is a big part of the reason I want to move honestly.So in summery I would say I may have a negative feeling or two about this bank.","2375":"I have been a customer with Bank of America for many years. Bank of America approved me for my first credit card when no one else would give me the time of day. They are the reason I have such good credit today.I had my mortgage with a different bank but their interest rate was so high so about 5 years ago, I decided to refinance with Bank of America since they have been so good in the past. Interest rates were much lower and the customer service was much better. My bills come extra early to remind me to pay them and they give you a 16 day grace period after your bill is due. I highly recommend Bank of America.","2374":"I have used Bank of America for my business account for the last 5 years. I have had some problems such as fraud on my personal account. In one instance they simply closed my personal checking account without notifying me. I was notified in a letter that my account could not be opened again. I had to open my personal account at a new bank. However, my business account has been good. I have a savings account and a merchant account with BA also. They do deposit the funds relatively quickly. I would say that BA is average to above average.","2373":"I have been with Bank of America for over 2 years now. I signed up originally to do Keep the Change. I love the program. I just round up everything I spend and I love that it puts money in my savings for me. The customer service is great as well, had an issue with someone else using my card and they put the money back on right away, and let me know when all issues were resolved. Every time I go into the bank, I get fast, friendly service. I also like the way the ATM is set up. At my old bank you had to use an envelope to deposit, making it a hassle. With the Bank of America ATM, it is quick and easy, as it just reads the check and counts the cash for you. Overall it has been a great experience so far.","2372":"I have been a Bank of America customer for approximately two years now. I have to say that the banks are safe (good online security too), they have a lot of ATMs. That makes finding an ATM very easy.I opened a checking account a year ago. I have to say that it has been easy to make deposits and withdrawals. There is another good point for them. About the customer service staff, I have to say that they have always been friendly, very kind and patient and have a sense of humor. They are very professional. I have never had an issue with customer service and would recommend anyone to join the bank.Overall, I think Bank of America has always been reliable for me.","2371":"I have been with Bank of America for just a few years but I love them. I commute out of state for my job and love the convenience Bank of America offers. Their hours are flexible, their drive-up ATMs offer every service I need, and their branches are popping up everywhere. I only have a savings account and checking account with them at the moment, but am working with them to start the process for buying a house. They are extremely knowledgeable and helpful and I\u2019m glad they are on my side. I hope to continue doing business with Bank of America for a long time.","2370":"I love Bank of America. I've been a customer for several years, and I'm completely pleased with their service. The employees are friendly, ATMs are easy to find, and the online banking is simple and convenient to use. They also alerted me to a possible identity theft issue when my Visa had suspicious charges on it, and quickly addressed the situation before any damage could be done. Any time I've had to call Customer Service, they've been courteous and were able to address my concerns in a satisfactory manner. I would recommend Bank of America to anyone looking for a solid banking experience.","1588":"I got my first checking account with Bank of America and they were very helpful! They answered all my questions and even gave me a book about how to save and manage money as a student. It is very easy to manage accounts online and transfer money between checking and savings. Because you can do everything online, paper statements aren't even necessary! I have never had any problems with my account, so I have never even had to use customer service. All the tellers I have interacted with have been polite, friendly and helpful. My entire family uses Bank of America and I would recommend them to others.","1740":"Using Bank of America has been a hassle for me the last few years. At the time, I wasn't making very much money at my job, I made a mistake and over spent by about $5. Not too big a deal, right? Wrong.Since I was in the red, they charged me a $35 fee. Still not too bad, but here's where it gets worse. I couldn't pay back the money right away because I lost my job not long after this. Since I couldn't pay the $35 fee, they charged ANOTHER $35 fee the next month. Then the month after that, and the month after that. So because I wasn't able to pay the first fee, they just kept tacking it on until I was $160 in the hole. This is beyond ridiculous. They won't work with me on getting this taken care of either, they demand all that money even though they should have put a freeze on my account after a month of not paying.I agree that I needed to pay the initial fees, but what they want? Not a chance.Never again, Bank of America. My business is going to credit unions.","1745":"I have been a loyal customer of BOA for over seven years. The bank is ubiquitous, so it makes withdrawals and deposits much easier when traveling or on business. Overall, I've personally had many wonderful experiences with Bank of America, from customer service to online banking. I was in a local branch to change my direct deposit for savings, for example, and the branch officer was not only courteous and polite, but answered all my questions without hesitation. It was quick and easy. Honestly, I've never had any problems banking with BOA during these seven years. As for online banking, it is, in fact, a life saver when it comes to my personal finances. Checking, savings, credit cards, and my loans are all visible and if I have any trouble, account support are there to help, in a flash!","1742":"I just switched to Bank of America after switching to a new job and my current employer uses BoA so I switched as well. Overall, I'd say that I'm very happy with the switch. They were very helpful in setting up all of my auto-billing information and I got a pretty good rate on the balance transfer from my credit cards. It's great since my employer uses them they are able to process my pay checks much faster. They also had a representative sit down with me, go over my credit score and pre-approve me for any sort of auto loans, and went over my options as far as a mortgages were concerned. It was nice to get some face time with a person at the bank.","1743":"I have been satisfied with my experiences banking with Bank of America over the past 8 years. They have several branches around me and have generally provided goodcustomer service. My local branch is great, although dealing with the company has made me feel like I was less than important in their grand scheme. Overall, I amsatisfied with the quality of services provided.As far as convenience, Bank of America seems to have branches everywhere I have been \u0080\u0094which I have found very useful when traveling. This is especially convenient when making withdrawals, since it can get me out of being charged extra.","1749":"Been with Bank of America for about a year, but have used them previously as well during the last ten years or so. Really the only reason I have an account with Bank of America is because I need money deposited into a bank account. There are some things you should be aware of about Bank of America. The first is that they charge you $8.95 a month if you use their tellers (real people vs doing everything online) or have statements sent to your home every month. Also, the interest rate that Bank of America gives customers is very bad, most credit unions have a savings rate that is multiple times greater. This is why I rated Bank of America two stars instead of three stars. Perhaps the best thing about Bank of America is convenience, they are located almost everywhere it seems.","2056":"I have had such an amazing experience with Bank of America. When I needed to start my account I did so over the internet. It got completely messed up somehow between my typing in my information and it being transmitted (I blame bad WiFi services at the time). When I noticed the issues I did not hesitate to contact customer service to help me out. I explained I had no idea what happened when the information was communicated and they jumped at the opportunity to assist me and make my account correct. It truly made my banking experience go to a whole new level and it was great! I was truly saddened by the fact that I had to change banks due to moving to a region that there was not a Bank of America anymore but the experience I had there changed the way I will think about banks forever.","1741":"Applying and receiving the credit card was simple and the representative was kind and helpful. However, upon one of my payments months later I had a problem. I made the payment through the Bank of America mobile banking app at 11:55 pm the day before it was due. They considered this to be the next day even though it clearly is not. I even had a transaction postage verification that states the day and I wish that I would have taken a screen shot of that because they claim the systems says otherwise. To me it just seems like an excuse to charge me and make money. Lame one Bank of America.","2058":"Bank of America has been in my life for more than six years. It was like we were best friends from the beginning. I went to open my new account at the local branch here in Uncasville, Connecticut, and from the first step in the door the manager and tellers made me feel like they genuinely cared for me and my money. I recently found a charge that I did not authorize on my debit card, and I called customer service right away. I spoke with very helpful service representatives who informed me that my account would be credited with the full amount of the unauthorized charge. Other than filling out a form with the bank, I did not have to fill out another piece of paper and I did not have any problems after. I am glad that my bank stands up for me as a customer and I feel safe knowing they care about my privacy and security as well.","1744":"Overall I've been very happy with Bank of America. I have both a debit and credit card that I use regularly through BofA and they haven't let me down. I was actually contemplating switching to PNC when I moved to the East Coast, but I was glad to find a BofA on my campus. Customer Service is always great, however I will have to say they sometimes don't have enough people to take care of all the customers. Aside from being understaffed, some of the tellers were quite rude to me. I think it was because I'm still very young and they do not take me as seriously as I wish. When I applied for a credit card in the Philadelphia Branch, they did not treat my like an adult.","1746":"I opened my first checking account with Bank of American when I was 16. So I've had a student savings and checking account with Bank of America for about 6 years and I'm very satisfied with the everything. I don't think I've ever been hit with any hidden fees or even overdraw fees and being a college student that is common. One of my favorite things is the ease of the online experience and the BofA app! It makes it so easy to transfer money between my savings and checking accounts, and check my balance at any point in the day. They've also made it easy and convenient to cancel my card if I happen to lose it. I'm also very pleased with the customer service which has always been wonderful.","2059":"I love using Bank of America for my personal checking account. I have their really cute HelloKitty debit card with matching checks. I use their ATM's for all my transactions and I rarely have to go inside for anything. Bank of America\u2019s customer service is awesome too. One time the ATM didn't count my money correctly when I made a deposit, I called customer service and they fixed the problem right away. It took a day or so to get money correctly credited to my account, but that\u2019s understandable. I have no complaints with their service and I have been using them for over five years now.","1747":"While I have good experiences with Bank of America's customer service, branch employees, full service ATMs, and quantity of ATMs, I do not agree with some of their policies (being a recent college grad). The policy that I have the biggest issue with is overdraft fees. It doesn't make sense to me that if I overdraw my checking account by $1 that I will be charged $35 instantly. If I sign up for overdraft protection it links my checking account to a credit card, charging the card $100, and putting $100 in my checking account. If you miss paying off your card expect to pay high interest rates. I eventually canceled my overdraft protection due to the fees and running up cash advance charges on my credit card (which I have thankfully been able to pay off). On top of protection fees the monthly maintenance fees that they charge me for not keeping a minimum balance ($2,500 is a little much for me right now) are ridiculous. I am currently paying a $12 monthly maintenance fee on my checking and $5 a month for my savings. I have just about finished switching to PNC Bank which has a much better online banking system \/ app offerings than Bank of America. PNC also has mobile deposits, owns all of Wawa's ATMs, and doesn't charge any fees for their checking\/saving\/growth account they provide with their Virtual Wallet Service. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another thing Bank of America didn't offer--a free longterm growth account! Bank of America is great if you have a lot of money to utilize all their top-tier features, but that's just not me right now to be honest.","1748":"Bank of America has always been good to me, but in the last year they've started charging a monthly maintenance fee when your balance is under $1500. As a college student, this happens from time to time, so I've been paying extra to have this account while I work in the summer to get more funds, which is pretty annoying. Keep in mind that there are new charges in their other accounts (I know they do this with savings accounts too). Otherwise, having access to their multitude of ATM's is always convenient for getting cash without paying ATM fees, which can save you a lot of money if you like using cash. I've never had any problems with Customer service, they've always resolved issues quickly and efficiently.","2377":"Overall, fairly easy to deal with, I had a problem with an unauthorized transaction on my account and with very little effort on my part or headache they resolved it in a timely manner and out the funds back in my account. My only complaint is that they let a online transaction overdraw my account in the first place.","2378":"When I first signed up for Bank of America, I was pretty happy with the bank. Sign up was easy, and there seemed to be some good perks like Keep the Change and they also gave me some student specific perks. However, my opinion on the bank soured quit a bit when I lost my first debit card. I went to a local Bank of America branch and applied for a new card. A month later and I had still not gotten a new debit card! I went back and applied for another one, and still nothing came! It took me another trip and two more weeks to finally receive a new debit card. I have talked to other Bank of America customers who have had similar problems receiving new cards from Bank of America. It seems like Bank of America needs to step up their customer service!","2141":"I recently applied for this card at the start of my senior year of college. I was glad to be accepted as I do not have much of a credit history. Due to the hard economic times I was not able to get a student loan for this semester, so this card was greatly appreciated. It has helped me get through the tough times at the end of the month. The interest rate is a little high but that is expected with a student credit card. Not a big fan of bank of america in general but this credit card has been a life saver for me.","2142":"I have had this card since I first opened my bank account with Bank of America. It was convenient since I did not have to apply for it and was approved instantly. It's easy to pay off with my bank account too and works well as a first credit card. Although, there are no other benefits to the card. I prefer to use my cards with some form of cashback bonus or discount. There was also no option to change how the card looks; it is just plain silver. I also have a low limit of $1000 on this card compared to my Discover card. I'd recommend this card to start out building your credit but would not recommend using it as your primary card.","339":"I've been with this bank for a while now and never really encountered any problems until trying to contact the customer service about a problem. Once I contacted the customer service I had to wait a really long time and I just felt like they forgot about my call the first time. Calling them the next day I had more success but barely, after a ten minute wait I finally go to talk to the people and felt like they didn't care at all about my problem. I wanted explain how I paid on time and got charged for a late payment, they did not want to believe me and I didn't get excused for the late payment. Overall the credit card is good, has good rates, and credit but the customer service really bothered me and I feel like this really hurt their review for them from me.","2379":"Okay\u00e2\u0080\u00a6I have been a BOA customer for about 8 years. I have both a checking and a savings account with BOA. This is an okay bank to deal with. I will honestly say, I am not jumping for joy when I think of my dealings with BOA, but again for me they are a convenient bank. Where I live in the Mid-Atlantic, BOA is EVERYWHERE! I really do mean this. I never have to worry about finding a BOA ATM. I think for this reason, the fees associated with withdrawing money from non-BOA ATMs is somewhat annoying but comprehendable. The best way to avoid these types of fees is simply use one of the many BOA ATMs that are practically within driving and in some cases\u00e2\u0080\u00a6walking distance from each other. So, convenience is one of the main reasons I stay with BOA\u00e2\u0080\u00a6if nothing else.I was able to complete my application for both accounts via the telephone with ease which I really appreciate.BOA and all the other banks charge fees for everything on the face of the sun. I have learned to avoid these fees by simply using the checking account for immediate purchases and for my direct deposit.Overall, BOA is an okay bank\u00e2\u0080\u00a6it gets the job done.","2145":"I first got a this card when I was 18 entering my first year in college to build up some credit. I was strictly going to use it for books and school supplies. I'm now 22 and about to graduate and have had a pretty good experience with this card. I believe when I first received it came with a 15% interest rate which wasn't that bad because I planned to pay off the book expenses as soon as I had a paycheck. Bank of America has also been very quick and effective to cancel this card the few times I've lost it and strange purchases showed up. Overall I've really enjoyed having this card and it has gotten me though college and a lot more. Highly recccomend.","338":"Bank of America is one of the best bank in the world. This bank is very helped me in my financial problems .when i was car loans this experience is too good for me .Bank of America is not irrirtating me when i was paying their money .I am very happy to do their work.Bank of America employees are also good their dealing their talking style awsome i am very impress for their behaviour.I also prefer to my friends and family member if you had a loan you will go for Bank of America because thier system and employees behaviour are perfect.","331":"I had just started my senior year of college and I was worried about finding an apartment after graduation. My parents live almost two hours away from my school and I had decided to stay in Seattle after graduation. I was worried about securing an apartment lease without a credit history. A friend in my biology class suggested that I apply for the BankAmericard Cash Rewards credit card. I thought it was a great way to help build my credit. I loved the fact that this card is unsecured and didn't require a large deposit because money was really tight. After a few months of making on time payments I actually had a pretty decent credit rating. After graduation I was able to use my new credit history to get an apartment in my name. This card is perfect for people just starting out in the world.","2140":"I've had my Bank of America Visa card for about a year now, and I'm honestly much happier with it than I am with my regular Bank of America account. Because it's integrated with my other bank accounts online, I can just transfer money straight to the card without having to receive a paper bill or sort through anything. The interest rate is reasonable, and the grace period is far preferable to overdrafting, which would sometimes happen with my debit card. If I'm attentive, and I really try to be, I generally end up paying very little interest just by paying off most of what I owe whenever I make more money.","2143":"I signed up for Bank of America with a college checking account about four years ago and have been mostly pleased with their service. I have a debit card and it can get a little problematic when I have false charges, because BoA really hates to help you in any way when it comes to that. Last month, due to a banking error which was their fault, I was double charged for something that made my balance drop below $0, so I was charged $10 on top of that for moving money from my savings account. I had to call customer service and fight with them for almost two hours to get the charges removed and for them to fix their error. I\u2019ve had nothing but good service inside the bank, but I would definitely recommend steering clear of their horrible customer service on the phone.","2149":"I have this Bank of America Rewards Card for about year now and the customer service is exceptional. Received a credit line of $2000 with a low APR. Within a few months, my number was stolen online and unauthorized purchases were made. BOA called me up while on vacation, warned me about the charges and credited my account. I got home from my vacation 5 days later and a new card was waiting for me in the mail. Very impressive.I receive 3% cash back on gas, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else. Within a few months, I saved $25 in rewards and deposited the amount into my checking account. I received the amount in a few days.Another great feature is the security logging on to the BOA online site. You see a unique picture you select every time you logon to the site. This prevents you from inadvertently logging on to a phishing site and giving away your logon info. Great feature I find missing on other credit card sites.","2148":"This is my first credit card and so far, so good. I've been using it for major purchases and have saved up a few miles. I live in Washington so Alaska Airlines is a great choice for me to travel. They seem to be pretty fair regarding their late fees and grace periods all though I have not been late in a payment yet. The annual fee is not too bad and it's great how many miles they give you to start out with! I have no complaints so far, and I plan to build up credit using this card. My parents have had their Alaska Airlines credit card for years and have taken full advantage of the miles. I love to travel and plan to do the same!","2147":"I opened up my Bank of America account because they had Bank of America people at my university during freshman orientation. It was very easy for me to set up and as long as I went to the Bank of America near my school the customer service was excellent. Unfortunately, that wasn't true of all Bank of America locations. It was very difficult to resolve certain things. Once Netflix had charged me for a movie that I hadn't returned after closing my account with them. I was low in my checking account and I wasn't expecting Netflix to charge me. During that one day I used my card 4 times for small purchases (some milk here, a Quizno's sub there, some gum, etc.) thinking that I still had about $20 dollars in the bank, which I wasn't too concerned about because I was getting paid the next day. Because of those purchases I was charged five $35 over draft fees and a good portion of my paycheck was eating up the next day. I got Netflix to reverse their fee within the week, but Bank of America wouldn't reverse my overdraft fees over the phone. I had to physically go into a store and talk with a person for over an hour to get it resolved. I now have Chase and they had the option of not having any overdraft fees.","2146":"I had this card with me when me and some friends embarked on a cross country road trip during winter break. Since this card gave rewards on gas purchases I payed for all the fuel for our little Saab 93 turbo with this little beauty. After driving 7000 miles and spending almost $1200 dollars on gas I had accrued over 35000 points, which I used to buy all my books for my last semester at college! This card is great the savings are phenomenal if you buy a lot of groceries or gas, I couldn't be happier with my Bankamericad Power Rewards and would recommend it for anyone.","2144":"I got wrangled into being a Bank of America customer when Bank of America bought my former bank. I only use BOA for a checking account and most of the time it's quite painless. There are always ATMs around, everyone takes my debit card, I do most of my banking online. I do wish they had the take a picture of your check and it will be deposited into your bank app for my phone though. They only trouble I have is when something goes wrong and you need to work it out, that is the equivalent of beating a dead horse. I can't even get them to change the zip code my card is associated with in the actual bank. During one conversation with a Bank of America customer service I actually told them \"they needed to rethink their business practices.\" That was how unhelpful they were.","330":"I have had my Bank of America Visa credit card for five years now and have had no problems with it. What can I say, it works like all credit cards in that you charge something to it and then you have to pay it off. It comes with standard protections against fraud and the ability to contest charges. They also do not hold you responsible for fraudulent charges. My current rate is 17% which I don't think is too bad, also if you make a late payment just call Bank of America and they will reverse the charge once a year. You can also handle most issues with the card online without any human interaction which is always a plus.","332":"I've been a account holder in Bank of America for around four years now, and I can truthfully say that it is convenient, yes, but annoying at times. Due to the bank\u2019s size, it is very, very easy to withdraw funds from my account, simply because there are ATMs that support Bank of America everywhere. I really like their online system, which is very secure and easy to use. However, in spite of this good stuff, there are some very obvious cons. Again due to its size and its inherent goals as a bank, it will try to charge the user any sort of fees it can. Also, the customer service is a hassle to deal with.","333":"I've been a member for five years and have not had any problems. When I have needed help I just go in and they quickly and professionally make any changes that I need. I needed to pull money from a CD and within minutes I had the money. Their online service works great. I have been able to pay bills quickly and without any problems. They also will alert me when my account balance gets low so I don't get overdraft fess. Also when I cash checks Bofa makes $100 instantly available and their ATM's allow you to deposit cash and checks without using an envelope.","334":"I have had accounts with Bank of America for 7 years, both checking and savings. I have also had a Visa BankAmericard Cash Rewards credit card with them for 1 year.The positive: I love that there are always a good number of ATMs around where I can do withdrawals and deposits (even check deposits!). I love that they have a nice, secure online banking system that's relatively easy to navigate and make transfers and pay off my credit card. I love that I get pretty decent cash-back on my credit card purchases and there's no annual fee for the card.The negative: Calling for simple issues can sometimes be a pain, it takes a while to get through to a person (I don't need to hear that I can check my account online 8x before trying to resolve my issue). But it is nice that it's 24\/7 and I have to say that although the phones are flawed, online chat support is very nice and convenient (but I'm not always by a computer).I'm also not a fan of the fees they try to stick you with sometimes, e.g. too many transfers in a month one time cost me $5, and I wasn't warned or made aware of this fee before it was taken.My interest on my savings could be a bit higher, it's pretty abysmally low.Overall: Love the convenience, but there's some bad things when you go with such a large bank, they don't seem to care too much about you.","335":"I have been an account holder with Bank of America for six years. The online application process was a breeze! I can't remember ever having an easier time opening a bank account. Until recently I never had a derogatory comment for Bank of America. I was given the option to get overdraft coverage for my account. I got it with a click of a button. Needless to say there were a couple of times that I had to use it and it was great that I only got a charge of $10.00 instead of the normal $32.00 when I had an oops in my bank account. For some reason it recently just disappeared and in order to get it again there are many more steps to the process and I no longer qualify! I still have not figured out what happened! The only other problem is there are not enough locations. My husbands employer does not offer direct deposit and the closest Bank of America to his workplace is over sixty miles! By the time he gets home the bank is already closed. Sometimes he gets paid in the middle of the week and we have to wait till the weekend to make the deposit. I have direct deposit through my employer and it has always been smooth sailing with Bank of America. Over all, I have been more satisfied with Bank of America than any other bank account I have had in the past! The employees have always been extremely nice and there has never been an error in my account!","336":"I opened my account due to the ease of use of BofA's online banking. It is, in fact, very easy to use, checking balances on the mobile app is a great feature, transferring to and from savings and credit cards is a snap and the bill pay works great for the most part. However, they tend to find any way possible to charge you fees, using a non-BoA ATM will net you not only the ATM fee but an additional BoA fee, overdraft protection from savings will get you a $10 charge every time, and the talk of charging a monthly checking fee is disconcerting. Haven't moved banks as of yet, but may consider in the future if they keep nickle and diming their customers.","337":"I've used Bank of America for years now and it was always tolerable. There was nothing outstandingly bad or good about the bank until recently. I used to enjoy the ease of use for my checking account because Bank of America buildings are everywhere and it was easy to pull money out of my account. Recently, however they\u2019ve implemented a system of charging for the use of the checking accounts. Originally, they made an announcement that they would be charging and there was a mass exit of people from the Bank of America system. Because of this, they announced that they would not do the charges. About a month later, I received a charge on my account for banking fees. They underhandedly went through with the fees, despite announcing they wouldn\u2019t charge them. Since then, I have not used them because of the fees and I really didn\u2019t appreciate being lied to.","2376":"I joined BoA after I moved to the Chicago area, wanting a new local Bank. National and Global access to ATMs was also a huge factoring in picking BoA. I opened a free checking account, with the \"Keep the change\" program, and I love it. I also think there mobile banking phone app is excellent I love being able to move money around, and check balances right on my phone. I even wanted to cash in some old savings bonds and they helped me out quickly and professionally. I have really enjoyed my banking experience with BoA and I plan on being with them from the foreseeable future. Keep up the good work BoA.","1213":"I think this is the best bank I have ever dealt with . the customer services is better than I can imagine , they are so friendly and searching for solutions not problems ( as my last bank was doing ) . the application for an account just take few minutes , it takes me just 20 minutes to finish every thing . the net-banking services are clear , easy , secure and you can do with it while you are comfortable and at ease . I recommend this bank for anyone . you will be very happy with it and will fell secure .","1212":"My first bank in US is Bank of America and I have been using them for about five years from now and their services are great. First the registration process to create a saving and checking account is very simple with very less documents that need to be filled in. I got about 200 checks for free during the sign up.Their online services are easy and simple to understand. The online account will automatically created by the bank representative at the time of creating your account. You can check your balance, pay your bills, get customer support all from the comfort of your home.I particularly like their pay bill feature, where you can search and find your service provider, like your phone provider, internet provider, or even your doctor's office, and schedule the payment for your bill. BOA automatically drafts out the check and send to the billing office and the amount will be paid against your account.They had a refer in program, where you can refer a person to the bank to start a saving or CD account, the bank will provide a referral bonus, I hope they still have this option.","1211":"I had a credit card with Bank of America for about two years. The introductory rate for the card was just okay. The customer service was okay but was not very helpful. When I attempted to get cash advances to help pay higher rate credit cards the process was not easy. I had to call several times to get it processed. Because of this I decided to close the account and open a new card with a better long term rate and better customer service over the phone. I would not recommend that anyone open an account with them for any reason.","1210":"My experiences with Bank of America have generally been good. Although their overdraft fees tend to be a little high, the ease of access to online accounts and the generally quick responses from customer service outweigh the few cons. In requesting a new debit card, the Bank was quick and responsive and I had a replacement within a week. My only serious complaint about the Bank of America is how long it takes to use their ATM's. There is often only one at their branches, so after waiting in a long line, one has to deal with a barely working computer system.","800":"I am very pleased with the services I received at Bank of America. I recently moved to Charlotte, NC, so I needed a new bank account. The manager assisted me very promptly and was very pleasant to work with. She gave me all the details I needed to make a decision about the bank account that was right for me, and was not upset when I chose the lowest account type. She then showed me how to use the ATM and online services until I felt comfortable. I absolutely feel comfortable going back. The only problem, was that there was a hold put on my debit card 20 minutes after I signed up, but it was quickly removed and I was allowed to use it again. The mobile banking is also a huge plus.","801":"You hear a lot of things about Bank of America, good and bad - and I've seen a lot of both. A lot of \"fine print\" goes with everything, and they love slipping things in without telling you. Phone service is trying at best, nightmarish at worst. Online banking is awesome - its main page is an easy-to-read overview of every savings\/checking account to your name (I use this more than anything).I live in a small town of 5,000-5,500, and my bank is the best - everyone's friendly and really helpful, and I always feel better walking out than I did in. The ATM takes cash\/checks, no envelope needed - the cash (and checks, if the amount is legible) is partially added to your account right away.","1214":"I have been using Bank of America since I was a freshman in College. Overall the experience has been okay. I am having some qualms about them, but this is a fairly recent development.Let me describe my checking account and debit card experiences. I liked the campus checking account I had with them. It was very convenient and didn't have a minimum. I love how easy it is to find an ATM and how easy and simple it is to deposit check and cash deposits. However I have grown up and left college, so now they have started to add fees and honestly I am not sure it is worth it anymore to have a charge of $8.95 per a month just to have a checking account. I am seriously considering changing my debit card just for this. I also felt that I wasn't informed about the change in my checking accounts adequately.","1215":"My over all experiences with Bank of America checking accounts are relatively positive. I have never once had a problem that wasn't resolved soon after. On my account type there is no minimum balance, and with being a college student, that feature itself can be a life saver. Another thing that I really enjoy about this account is the ability to make deposits from at the ATM. It is very convenient and very easy to do, it saves me a lot of time when I have to make a deposit at school and an ATM machine is located closer to me than a branch is. I would have to rate Bank of America 5 out of 5 because I haven't ran into any true problems yet and I have enjoyed saving through this company.","2438":"My experiences have been very mixed with BOFA. The people in the branch in my area have been excellent, very friendly, and always helpful. The problem is, phone support has not been so great. Even worse, online support is awful. Still, their checking account and website work well. They have ATMs everywhere, which is a big plus. I've stuck with them so far, but I might make the switch to another bank to get better customer service on the phone. Also, their branches are popular, and I've definitely seen lines at some locations get very long. They're not the best, but probably one of the better of the large banks. There is definitely more of a professional feel than at Citi.","2437":"I bank with Bank Of America, and I must say I love this bank. I love the fact that there are little to no fees for me to pay. I like that you can access your account via the internet, through a text, an app on your smartphone, or over the phone. One feature I do like that they are not on a \u201cenvelope system\u201d. I think deposits are easier since they eliminated envelopes. This not only saves time for the customers who are trying to deposit money into their accounts but it also saves money (in my opinion) for the bank because they eliminated that envelope expense.","2436":"Bank of America has been an overall positive experience for me. The online banking is relatively simple to use and understand, and I have never run into problems with my bank account. However, the fine print and restrictions of an account can be confusing and bothersome. For example, I would be charged extra if I made too many transfers between my accounts (I have a checking and a savings), used a teller for my checking account (but not my savings), and other lengthy-worded consequences. This may just be the case for the specific type of account I chose, but it\u2019s something to keep in mind. Besides that though, Bank of America fulfills the role of a bank adequately and acceptably, and the online banking aspect is convenient and relatively easy to use.","2435":"I signed up for Bank of America right before I left for college and I must say, I have not had a single issue with them. It may be because I've never actually had to deal with a teller due to my eBanking status. However, a technologically-minded person such as myself has greatly benefited from the services they offer in terms of accessibility! Their mobile banking allows me to easily check my balance and usage history with just a simple text message; when I acquired a smartphone, their mobile application was a godsend in terms of accessibility and convenience! Signing up for the bank account was also a breeze. I just brought in a few points worth of identity and voila, the whole process was done within minutes! I'd recommend Bank of America to anyone who would like to take advantage of their eBanking services.","2434":"I hear a lot of things about Bank of America on the internet all the time but I've personally never had a problem with them and neither has anybody I know. Perhaps it's just the branch specifically here in West Boca, but I have found everything satisfactory. The only thing I can complain about is when I first went to set up an account, I had to wait 15 minutes.I use my debit card all the time and I've never had an issue. Never had a fee. I use the electronic banking, so I don't pay $5 per month on my account.They even have a terrific app for Android that I use to check my balance and even transfer conveniently from my phone. Honestly, there isn't much more I could ask from a bank except for free money. And guess what, they gave me $50 when I signed up just for being a first time customer.I am extremely satisfied with Bank of America and will open up all future bank accounts with them and recommend them to my friends and family.","2433":"I opened a savings and checking account with BOA and elected to enroll in the \"Keep the change\" program. Months later I found out I was not actually enrolled in the program and it was too late to enroll at that point. The lady who opened my account pushed the program and I thought it was a pretty cool idea and asked for it. They refused to remedy the problem. I also never received the 25 checks they stated would be sent for opening an account. I hardly ever use checks so 25 would have lasted me years. Instead, I had to buy some after waiting a couple months and checking back after the free ones never showed. Finally the last thing I dealt with was that the savings account wasn't free... only for the first year. this wasn't communicated to me either. Overall this is the worst bank I've ever had to deal with. Tried for one year, never again. Too bad they bought out MBNA too as they were a good credit card company before BOA took over. WORST BANK EVER.","2432":"I was with Bank of America for a little over a year before I switched to my new bank. Absolutely horrible service! They failed to notify me that some of the fees on my checking account changed when I moved from Florida to Nevada, so I ended up suffering from over $50 in fees before I figured out what happened, and they refused to refund me! Their phone and bank representatives are horrid, and seem completely disinterested in trying to help you. I will dissuade any and all friends and family from using their services. I am never going to return to this bank!","2431":"I've never had a problem with BofA. I think they are a great bank and extremely well known. I have had issues with my account and false charges in the past but when I called they resolved the issue quickly, refunded my money, and issued me a new card and card number. Keep in mind this was all free of charge which is great when so many banks have hidden fees. One of the greatest perks includes easy transfers of money. My friend also has BofA and whenever we need to exchange money it's easy to hop online and send money to each other without a problem. Another great perk is the different card options that they give you when ordering a new card. My current card is an Angels card but I have friends who have Hello Kitty and other sports teams.","2430":"I have had a long term account with them. Both checking and a credit card. Checking account is fine as long as you don't need your card unlocked. I had several times where my card was locked and I could not get them to unlock it in a timely fashion. These times were few and far between but usually occurred because of gas pumps. Times when I have needed them to explain to me have been fine, but I sometimes find that when I need to go into a location to get something they are very understaffed. So you will end up with a long wait in a line.","1219":"Overall, Bank of America isn't great, but it isn't horrible, either. For a massive bank, they do a good job of trying to assist each customer properly, and the tellers at my local branch are always polite and attentive. I dislike the fact that there are so many fees, even on 'free' checking accounts, and I really don't like having to pay to talk to a teller. I appreciate the online banking tools they have, and the fact that I can do almost everything through an ATM, rather than go into the branch location.My biggest issue with them is around consumer fraud issues. When my identity was stolen, they made it truly difficult to speak to the correct person. I realize this is an area that has rapidly expanded in the past few years, and I hope they are able to put some processes in place that will both streamline the handling of fraud cases internally, and make the process easier for customers.","1218":"I have been with Bank of America for 12 years. Yes, I have heard both negative and bad things about the company, but I think that goes with just about any company. Problems have been few and far between. The few issues I have had have been resolved completely and the employees went above and beyond to make sure that I was satisfied with them. I started out with a checking account and throughout the years have gained car loans, a mortgage and a credit card. They have great rates and I am very satisfied with my checking account and all of their products. Bank of America locations are convenient and ATMs are everywhere. I would definitely recommend Bank of America to anyone and I will continue to do business with them. They are a great company!","2439":"I was with Bank of America for about a year as a checking and savings account customer and ended up leaving them over customer service issues at the branches I visit. My main issue was that they wanted to offer me free overdraft protection, to which I said \u201cSure!\u201d Little did I know they signed me up for a Bank of America credit card I did not ask for with the smallest limit I\u2019ve ever seen, which if I over drafted the balance would be charged to my credit card. As you can imagine, I was very surprised and canceled my accounts with them immediately. While it's partly my fault for assuming that my overdraft would come from my savings account, they also didn't tell me they would be opening a credit card for me.Other than that, the banking and checking were fine just like with any other bank. As long as I maintained a direct deposit checking would remain free, and they offered a comparable interest rate on my savings account. There are always tons of branches, so I had no problem finding one, though overall I\u2019ve found their tellers to be slow in comparison to other banks I\u2019ve been with.If you\u2019re looking for lots of locations for basic savings and checking, the bank is pretty average. It\u2019s possible my customer service issues were isolated to the branch I visited, but that is something to consider as well.","1217":"I have a Bank of America Power Rewards card, and I am very satisfied with it overall. However, I am a very responsible individual and I pay off my balance every single month. In fact, I don't even know what my interest rate is because I've never had to pay it. The reason I like this card so much is that the rewards are 100% legitimate. When I get to 5000 points, I get $50, no problem, no hassle, nothing unpleasant. Moreover, I like that they are VERY good about fraud prevention. Twice I had fraud on my card (nothing major) and both times they very easily deleted the bad charges and with no hassle I got a new card. I would highly recommend getting a Power Rewards credit card AS LONG AS YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE. The thing is, too many people aren't responsible, and then it isn't worth it.","807":"My wife and I decided to open a simple checking account, so we decided to go with Bank of America. So far the experience has been absolutely fantastic. When we initially went in to set up our account, we were greeted by some of the best customer service we have seen to date. We had recently opened an account with Chase but decided to cancel that account as we had a rather serious issue that they preferred to run circles around, but Bank of America seems committed to doing the opposite of that. Bank of America is also very convenient as they have ATM's almost everywhere. In addition to that their online banking service has been phenomenal. Since opening our account with Bank of America, we\u2019ve not only received outstanding customer service, but also a fantastic savings program. I think we may have finally found a bank for us.","805":"I opened an online only bank account with Bank of America, but as far as I'm concerned it's just as great as going into a bank and spending time to open an account. I have checking and savings and can access it online very quickly. I love how I can deposit cash or checks into any ATM and its immediately reflected in my available balance, no waiting for things to clear for days. Purchases are pulled from available balance immediately so I never have to second guess where I stand as far as money goes. I have enjoyed being a Bank of America customer so much. I also have used their bill pay option and it is very easy to set up and use, the money gets extracted right away so again, there is no wonder in my mind of how long it will take to show I have less than what I paid. They mail out the checks from the bank for me and I don't have to worry about a thing. I highly recommend Bank of America, especially the fast easy sign up process online.","353":"I\u2019ve been a Bank of America customer for over four years now and I love them! I didn\u2019t have the best credit score, but I worked with them and they helped me out. They also helped me with a small car loan recently.Before I started banking online, I was mailing them checks. One of my payments was considered \u201clate\u201d because of a bank holiday that got in the way. I called, explained the situation to them, and they took off all the charges. They were really understanding and helpful. I didn\u2019t think banks were so great!Bank of America offers reasonable rates and fair fees. I expect to be a customer with them for a long time!","354":"I was looking for a personal loan for a few home improvements that I needed to make. My bank has a terrible interest rate on personal loans so I did some shopping around and Bank of America was the best in my area. It was only a $5,000 loan so it was going to be paid off quickly and Bank of America was the only bank that would even consider loaning me such a small amount. The only issues I had were with the application and some issues I had when I made my first payment. The application was a bit confusing and I actually had to talk to the bank manager about a few things on the app that didn't make sense. I think of myself as rather competent so this irritated me a bit. The only other issue was when I made my first payment, it didn't post to the account until over a month after I made it. They charged me a late fee which they DID remove after I showed them proof of payment made and the date it was made on. Customer service was really attentive and always there to answer my questions. Overall, a solid 4.","350":"Let me just start off by saying that I'm a person that values great customer service and expect to be treated with respect. I have been with Bank of America for 4 years now and I cannot say enough about how welcomed I feel every time I enter one of their banks. I'm always great with a \"Hello\" or \"Good Afternoon\". I feel as though I am part of the Bank of America family. Every associate I have ever engaged in conversation with has been very professional and very courteous. They possess the traits that many companies are forgetting about and for this reason I will continue using them as the bank I entrust my money with. Thanks Bank of America for providing the top notch customer service :)","809":"I have a mortgage with this bank. The mortgage started off at another bank but was switched to hear shortly after it began. I have had a few issues with receiving my payment coupons in the mail. I am happy to say that every time I call and complain about this issue they fix it and let me pay over the phone with no extra fees. I don't like how they have no convenient locations around me so I can pay my bill in person but the ease of doing it over the phone when there is a problem makes up for that.","808":"My experience with Bank of America has been a horrible one, and I will soon be switching banks because of it. First, the monthly charge for banking is unheard of, and Bank of America is the only bank that charges this fee. Second, this fee will put your account in to overdraft if you don't use your bank that often, and Bank of America won't even call, email, or anything to let you know that it has been overdrafted. When I tried to get these fees waived, they told me that there was nothing that they could do because they were valid bank fees. When I started I was told that it wouldn't put the bank into overdraft by charging these fees. I would never advise anyone to use this bank, I would even choose US Bank over Bank of America.","351":"Bank of America has been my bank for coming up on 10 years. I started with them when they were one of the only banks in my area and I have been with them through every major financial change in my life. With both my checking and savings account they are very helpful in securing my money and for that I'm forever thankful. A few months ago they alerted me before I could become the victim of identity theft when I used my debit card at a gas station. They called me up and asked if I just bought over 300.00 dollars worth of gas and of course I did not so they put a stop to that transaction and I had my new debit card in a few days. This was all while I was on vacation and I wouldn't have found out about it until I returned home. This alone has saved me countless hours of wasted time and wasted money, thanks Bank of America.","806":"I've had a Bank of America checking account for work for a few years now ever since I started working. I use it fairly often because my work check gets deposited straight to here. From my experience, the customer service at Bank of America is excellent outside of one complaint I had due to a personal issue. Besides that, their representatives have always been there to help me the moment I walked in that door. The first time I signed up with Bank of America was a breeze. The application process was very easy and I was good to go in no time. The one thing that I like the most about BOA is the fact that you can deposit cash at an ATM instead of going inside. This saves a lot of time and is very convenient.","352":"I have banked with Bank of America for 3 years now and I have been impressed with the quality of customer service. I rarely have any problems with the bank at all. Whenever I go into a branch the employees have always been friendly and helpful. I mostly use the online banking component and I have found this to be extremely easy and convenient to use. I especially enjoy the 'keep the change' feature to my checking account. This helps my savings grow by rounding up the amount I charge to my checking account to an even dollar amount and transfers that to my savings. I plan to continue banking with Bank of America for a long time.","804":"I have had a Bank of America credit card for about 5 years now. I love the shopping points system where if you shop through specific vendors you receive bonus points. The credit card also allows your daily purchases to be turned into rewards such as gift cards, or cash. I have found it extremely easy to redeem the awards. The rewards have always come within a few days.The Bank of America customer service is excellent. A few times I have been double charged by merchants and after calling Bank of America, the second charge as removed within minutes. Their fraud department has also called me several times while I was making a large purchase (washer and dryer at Lowes) to ensure that I am actually the one purchasing the products. I have a credit card with another bank and it definitely does not have the rewards and excellent customer service that Bank of America provides.","803":"I had owned a checking card with them for one year and although I like a few things about them I have to say that my overall experience with Bank of America was mostly bad. I was charged random fees with them all of the time. Every time I checked my bank account I was missing some money somehow. I think its really unfair to be charged fees by a bank when they already makes money off of your money in the first place. I do love how high-tech their ATM machines are. They are very convenient when making deposits such as checks and money because of the way they are designed. The bad outweighs the good with BOA. I DO NOT RECOMMEND BANKING WITH THEM.","802":"I opened a Bank of America account as my first checking and savings account and are still using them 5 years later. I have always recommended Bank of America to family and friends and everyone has loved them. I've always had great customer service no matter which branch I went to, even in different cities or states. I applied for my checking and savings account online and it was very clear and easy and it has only gotten better as the years have passed. It was no hassle and they mail you everything you need, including all check cards, checks, and all the information you would need. I never plan to change to another bank for as long as have a banking account and would always recommend it to anyone who asks.","1216":"My experiences with Bank of America have mostly been very good. Before opening up my bank account about 5 years ago, I was basically financially illiterate. The tellers at my bank carefully explained to me everything I needed to know. It couldn't have been easier.My one complaint with Bank of America is that when I wire money overseas (my circumstances are such that this occurs on a semi-regular basis), the conversion rate is pretty bad. I take it that the rates online are better than what the banks actually end up doing.But for someone who is just looking for a good reliable bank with good customer service and a good online banking system, Bank of America is very good.","3522":"I Left B Of A Because I felt I had been a loyal customer of B of A for 50 years (since having a school savings account).\u00a0 When I asked for \"customer for xx years\" status many years ago, I was told that I had to come up with an old deposit book to prove it.\u00a0 A minor incident, but I always remembered it.\u00a0 I had always believed in the bank, but even in a trivial matter, the bank couldn't believe in\u00a0me.\u00a0 This sowed a powerful seed, and B of A should take heed (if it cares to).\u00a0 Individuals are what makes the bank possible.\u00a0 If individuals don't count, will the bank stand? When it looked like B of A was becoming unstable a few years ago, I finally made\u00a0the long considered move to Wells Fargo, which I have been satisfied with. B of A's customer service has nearly always been good, and I believe their online banking is excellent.\u00a0 I didn't have trouble with unresolved problems like several reviewers seem to have.\u00a0","1533":"I have been using this card for many years, and received over one thousand cash back over the years. It was the main credit card I had been using. However, recently I have used some other cards to take advantage of the sign-in bonus of those cards. So I kept this card sleep for a while, but recently BOA gave me an offer to receive 5% cash back for purchase of everything, which is great, so I switched back to this card. The few things I like about this card: (1) BOA provides generous credit line to me. For a couple of times I called BOA and asked for credit line increase, and got approved. (2) With a high credit line, this card frequently provides 12-month 0% APR for balance transfer, which can be very helpful when I need money for a high yield investment. (3) Each purchase made with this card will immediately show up in my BOA online account, with good details. Based on my observations, the service is better than Chase or American Express cards. I only thing that makes me not to use this card is its cash back rate is 1% for everything purchase, which is slightly lower than some other cards, like Chase Sapphire preferred card. Overall, BOA cash rewards card has been a good card, good and convenient rewards, high credit line, and easy to use and monitor online.","359":"I absolutely love my BankAmericard Cash Rewards Card. I have had it for over a year now and have already used it enough to cash in for rewards. I really appreciate having the grace period because I prefer to pay it off all at once. I've had cards that have a 0 day grace period before and I end up with more fees than I'd care to.The customer service on the card is helpful, too. I was once late on my payment without realizing it, and when I called to explain what happened, they were really nice about it. Because I had never been late before and had been a customer for a while, they didn't end up charging me the late fee after all.","358":"I must admit I am not a big fan of Bank of America, especially this card. I thought it would be great for a new college student to have a card that encourages me to start building my credit. However, I did not miss a payment, but wound up sending a payment in late just once and my card rate went up almost 10%. I felt like there was no grace period at all and immediately it hurt my credit and I felt from the start they would try to encourage me to have good credit with a card like this advertised to students. I do not encourage any parents or students to get this card.","357":"I've been using this credit card for quite a few years and I've never had any problems with it! I love that it's a VISA so it gets accepted every where and I never worry about not having the right card. This is the only card I use and I really appreciate the rewards. I also have a very high credit line for someone my age and I think it was because I was able to start building my credit at such a young age. It's very easy to use and convenient. I really appreciate the service with Visa and with my bank because it makes building my credit very easy.","1532":"This is an excellent credit card to have if you are a frequent traveler such as I am. It does require a good credit score in order to be eligible, however it does not charge any annual fees and offers a base rewards earning rate of one point per dollar spent, 2 points per dollar spent on Amtrak purchases, 5 percent of your points back every time you redeem, as well as 18,000 bonus points after you make your first purchase. This card is extremely handy to have on hand especially if you ever travel with Amtrak as it can save you a great deal of money. This card would be a great addition to your wallet and one that I highly recommend.","355":"I love Bass Pro Shops!","1531":"I recently signed up for this credit card as my first type of card. I talked the terms over with the manager when I was applying and they seemed fair. I have been warned by others, however, to use this card cautiously as the rates are on the high side. Fortunately, I have a good record of spending less that I make. It's a good card if you use it as it is supposed to be used - for emergencies. I would definitely recommend this card to college kids who are trying to establish a good credit, as it has very fair terms.","1530":"I've had a BankAmericard Cash Rewards Platinum Plus Visa for 2 years now and couldn't be more pleased. I've already earned $83 cash-back just by using it for everyday things. I love that I'm making money while building credit. And No annual fee is a big plus in my book.It's great that it's Visa which is ubiquitously accepted everywhere, a feature everyone loves.Also, although I'm not a fan of Bank of America because of they're occasionally sleazy fees, I do have a checking and savings with them. And having them all together lets me pay off my credit card easily from the same web interface (and I must admit Bank of America has a very nice web interface that feels secure).All in all, like I said I'm not a fan of Bank of America in general, but this card is convenient and overall wonderful. No complaints, only praise.","356":"I use this card for most of my purchases. I rarely have a problem with any merchant. I enjoy using this card for online purchases as they have a secure feature that allow a user to obtain a temporary card number and use it to make an online purchase. That way I have no fears of anyone obtaining my credit card number for illegal purposes. I have never had a problem with customer service. They are always very responsive. I don\u2019t seem to be put on hold for any length of time. I highly recommend this card for anyone who uses a credit card.","3523":"Would Give 0 Stars If I Could I had heard all of the negative stuff about BOA and had never had a problem with my BOA credit card. In fact, they have been routinely increasing my limit and offering me 0% APR on special purchases. This is an effort to get me to spend more, right? I always pay on time, so today, I took some advice I heard from various people in the finance world and called BOA to see if I could get a reduction in my usual APR. They said I didn't qualify, and I understood. Doesn't hurt to ask, right? But where I took exception was when I was told that upon review of my account, they were also lowering my available credit to about $200 over what my present balance is because my balance has gone up over the last 6 months (which they encouraged with \"special offers\"). Really? I had to scramble around and stop any recurring payments so I wouldn't go over and suffer further fees. BOA not only won't help me, they are punishing me for even asking. So I cut up my card. They aren't getting one more penny out of me than what I currently owe.","1534":"Overall, I have had no major problems with Bank of America. The only issue that I have ever encountered was when I had a regular checking\/savings account and was getting charged 8 dollars a month, unknowingly. All I had to do was call, the charges were reversed, and I just switched my account type. It was easy and simple and they are very nice to deal with! There is also always a location near my house and conveniently wherever I go, and that's one of the main reason why I decided to open an account with Bank of America. I recommend it.","1535":"I was banking with Bank of America for two years. I did enjoy the perks the bank offered like cash deposits at ATMs as well as check depositing at the ATMs as well. The hours of operation were good. They are open almost everyday. I have a checking account open but it was a college student account. They had a program available where if I spent 1.50, they would round to the nearest dollar and deduct .50 cents and add them to my savings account. At the end of the month, they would match the amount and ass it to my savings. Its a good way to save money. Overall a very good bank. I would recommend to anyone because there are also locations everywhere in America.","1538":"I am a former customer of this bank. I primarily used BOA for managing a personal checking account. When I first opened the account things were pretty good. I had a pleasant experience throughout the application process and was pleased with the level of service I received. Things have seemed to change over the years. I recently made the decision to longer maintain a checking account at this bank based on the decline of service and the ridiculous fees that I was being charged. I wouldn't have minded staying a customer, but I was really turned off after being told that I would be charged a fee for not maintaining a minimum average balance of $1500. There are plenty of other banks out there who will not charge fees to their customers, so my advice is to shop around if you are looking to open up a checking account.","1537":"I have had a checking and savings account with Bank Of America for 5 years. In that time, I have had positive and negative experiences. In one incident, I had a merchant trying to incorrectly take a second payment out of my account. Bank of America was able to assist me in getting this removed within 1 business day. I also had an experience in which my account was overdrawn due to a payment being taken out sooner than I expected, I was able to get a courtesy waiver of the overdraft charge. I have had issues with finding out about bank policies and fees after the fact, but I can attribute that somewhat to not asking enough questions when opening the account. Anytime I have had to contact customer service to get clarification, I get great assistance, even if its not the answer I am looking for, they are always patient, courteous, and knowledgeable. The only complaint I have about their customer service is the hold time, it takes a long time to get someone on the phone. They make up for it by offering customer assistance via online chat with a representative. I use this option now, and they always log on within about 1-2 minutes of me initiating the chat session.","1536":"I left Bank of America checking a little into last fall. For a long time I enjoyed the what seemed to be good interest rates and the fact that my money seemed to be pretty easily accessible. Then early into last summer I ran into a problem with Bank of America. I work off of commission income and my commissions were way down with the economic crisis. Bank of America requires that you keep $1,500 in your checking account or they start to nail you with all sorts of fees. I had dropped below that $1,500 for a few months and called them to ask if they would reconsider the fees or at least some of them. I was blatantly told \"No, that's against policy, but thanks for banking at Bank of America\". With the way the economy is I closed out that account and just kept my main one at Chase. I don't need to deal with that when there are a lot of other cheaper options out there with no fees.","2321":"Overall I am very disappointed with Bank of America because of how they handle themselves. They want to nickel and dime the customer for everything from not having an adequate balance in the account, to rearranging which payments come out first so that it makes you artificially overdraft. I only continue to deal with them because they have a wide availability throughout the country and it costs money to cancel the account with them. If there was no penalty for canceling the account, I would do it immediately and never look back at them. The customer service is mediocre. They tend to resolve issues quickly but getting through to an actual person takes a long time.","2322":"I had really bad experiences with Bank of America. The secondary checking account I opened started out fine and was very easy to open. I did it online. There were no fees, no minimum balance. After a while, I forgot I had the account. But out of nowhere, they started charging me maintenance fees and zapping my account with different fees. I almost never used the account, and they just kept taking fee after fee after fee! It eventually led to my account ending up with a negative balance and overdraft fees being charged as well. With my own bad experience and the experiences my friends have had, I would never use Bank of America again.","2323":"I have been with Bank of America for the last four years. It was the first Bank that actually gave me a chance after I had previously messed up my credit. I love the variety of options that I have with this bank. They offer savings, checking, mortgages, credit cards, and much more. I have never had a problem with hidden fees or shady business dealings and I love the convenience of the bank. There are so many ATM's and branches in most of the world. Another thing that I love about Bank of America is the fact they have so many security precautions. When ever I make a purchase I can see it immediately on my phone and if my account gets low I get an alert.","2324":"I've been with Bank of America for about ten years. I love this bank for many reasons, but my top reason is I don't have to pay a fee for them to hold my money as long as I have direct deposit. I love the option of having online support for all of my banking needs, because I hate the idea of waiting on hold to speak to a customer service representative. I love the online banking features that Bank of America offers. I can transfer money and pay my bills without having to leave my home. I also love the idea of going to their ATM; which is only 2 minutes from my home and not having to pay a dime to withdraw my money.","2325":"I have been a customer for the last 2 years. The customer service here is impeccable. Every problem that I had was handled quickly and effectively. Customer service helped me set up my online banking and cleared up all the questions that I had. I received prompt notification about any problems with my account. What I love the most is the universality of this bank. I can always find an ATM when I need one, no matter where I go. I travel quite a bit and even if I go out of country, there is always a least one partner bank where I can use their ATM's without fees! I do not have any complaints about the service here.","2320":"I had decided to switch banks after a less than pleasant situation at the bank I was using. Switching to this bank however was not a good move on my part. I choose to do online banking for the convenience it would create for me. After opening an account with them things seemed to be going rather well until they start hitting my account with fees. After multiple attempts to contact them via there online support and not getting any place I decided to write them as they so request people to do on their website. However there was no response to my inquiry and the fees keep on coming. I am now in a situation where I am left with no choice other than to decide what my future with this bank will be. Unfortunately this bank as many only look at their customers as a dollar amount figure and not the true people they are. I am very disappointed with my experience with this bank.","2326":"I have been with Bank of America for about 4 years now and have been very pleased with their services. I have had to do a charge back for an order I placed that was never delivered and they were able to tell that the authorization was not in my usual pattern and alert me that there was an issue. I was able to call in and they were able to reverse the charge. I then cancelled my current card and they issued a new card that day. I am a big fan of using their mobile banking application on my iPhone. It makes it very easy to check my spending history and to pay my bills right from my phone. I am completely paperless now. I am really glad to have a bank like BOA.","2327":"My husband and I love this bank. Bank of America has many locations and this makes it easy for us to withdraw money or even make a deposit when we need to. They also have a great staff who are always willing to go above and beyond expectations with all of their clients, including us. Their online bill pay feature makes it easy for us to pay our bills. They make things easy to understand and do not treat us like we are just a number. I would recommend this bank to anyone who needs to bank because they are an all around great bank.","2328":"I have been a customer with Bank of America for more than 10 years and have a checking\/savings account and credit card through them. Every time I have contacted them about any issues I may have had they were prompt and very helpful. It is hard to beat the number of bank locations and ATM locations all across the United States. I love the deposit feature where customers can now deposit checks and cash through any Bank of America ATM. I had to cancel my credit card once and the bank was very quick to send a new one and was happy to help me when I walked into the branch location. BoA probably isn't as good as a credit union but is probably the next best option.","1393":"I've been with Bank of America for about 3 years now and I have to say that I am quite pleased with their services. The tellers are always extremely polite whether I'm there in person or just discussing business with them on the phone. Their service is fast and reliable and I have never had any transaction issues with my accounts. I had my wallet stolen once and didn't realize it until about 12 hours later. My debit card had been charged for a gasoline purchase. Once I informed the bank they promptly canceled my card. They were also kind enough to quickly send me a new card and refund a for my loss!","2329":"I switched to a credit union from Bank of America last year. I had an okay experience with Bank of America but they are just a typical bank: their fees were high and I felt like I was just another number to them. The customer service was average, but now I'm at a credit union where they know me and I have more control over my money. There are less fees. Being a bank, Bank of America is trying to make as much of a profit as possible and that negatively affects me as a consumer. If you want to use a bank, Bank of America will suffice. If you want top quality customer service, lower fees, and more control over your money I would recommend switching to a credit union.","1390":"My wife and I have had Bank of America since we have been married. Their online application process is simple and easy. They also have excellent phone support for bank services. They have ATMs everywhere and they are easy to access and use. I rated their customer service a little low because anytime I have actually been in a branch, there is always a line and it seems like no one is there to assist you unless you are setting up a new account or service. Bank of America does, however, have the most useable online services, in my opinion. For example, if you have an additional service (car loan\/mortgage) with them, it is super easy to transfer money to the note, instead of mailing! We did have a fraudulent charge on our account, and Bank of America sent an e-mail within minutes of the occurrence and had our funds back in 24 hours. Overall, the Bank of America system is convenient for the tech-savvy and people who work during typical hours.","1392":"I was a customer of a small bank that was bought by another bank, that was bought by another bank, that was bought by Bank of America. In this process BofA informed me that they no longer offered my savings account. In order to maintain my account, I had to open another credit card account and a checking account. Now with 3 accounts (when I only wanted one) I found out their checking order of operations is a little strange. BofA would deposit checks and debits not in date order but in largest to smallest order. So if I wrote 3 checks for $20 and debited $100 and then wrote another check for $200. They would debit my account, $200, $100, $20, $20, $20. They did this to try and rack up overdraft fees. Next came the fees, I never changed my account but started getting $7-$24 monthly fees for having an account. That all being said, they really do have the most ATMs around and a lot of physical banks if you need to actual go in. There mobile apps are also top notch.","3524":"Bank Of America And Bank Transfers In my state all government benefits go through BOA unless otherwise stated. Well I didn't have a choice with my disability. It was automatically put on the BOA card. With the first payment I had received I chose to go to BOA, and pull it out but I had set up the transfer process through BOA to my bank for the next time I would receive my TDI. This morning that is what I did especially since they had it listed as \"One-Time Immediate Transfer\" with no charge for the transfer. I did this at 7 a.m. and waited until I knew the banks were of operating hours before I started checking. Well now it's 10 a.m. and still nothing has been transferred so I started calling both my regular bank and BOA. I find out from BOA it could take up to 3 days for the transfer!!! What the he?? kind of service is that. If it stated on their site \"immediate\" then it should be within a few hours... NOT DAYS!!!!","1394":"I think Bank of America is a rather large bank with decent customer service. The thing that I don't really appreciate about the bank is that they have a lot of fees to pay. You can obviously avoid them by completing certain things each month like make 5 transactions a month or have at least $150 in your checkings account. But besides that they have decent service. My checks normally go through rather quickly (3-4 business days) and I like having all of their ATM machines don't need envelops to deposit money. I currently use eBanking with them which is really convenient because I can do everything through the ATM without ever going to a teller. The only problem is that when I actually want to talk with a teller, I can't unless I pay $8\/month for that service.","1395":"I signed up with Bank of America and have not used it for much more than the minimum services offered. I usually do everything though the online website and have never had any problems. Their website is very intuitive and simple and I have never had any problems with it. On the rare occasions that I have had to go into a physical location the workers have been very helpful and kind. One thing I love is their Keep the Change program which allows me to transfer the change from a purchase into my savings account, where it can grow. It may not seem like much, but over the course of a month it can really add up. Overall my few experiences lead me to believe that it is a good bank.","1396":"The customer service associates at Bank of America are always very helpful. I had an unnecessary hold on my account after making a purchase out of state. When I called the bank to remove the hold, and let them know that it was not fraud and that I work out of state, the associate quickly and efficiently made the correct adjustments. I was impressed to hear of the efficiency of their fraud detection system, that in case of a transaction that seems problematic the bank will contact the account holder and put a hold on the account. Although my situation was not fraud, I definitely appreciated the Bank's \"better safe than sorry\" method of monitoring my account.","1397":"I am going to be moving my Bank of America account. While there are some good things about this banking giant, there are also some things I'm not impressed with. The customer service is the worst I have ever seen. There is a level of arrogance that is hard to compare. I'm not sure why there is this arrogance, as there is really no reason for it. I feel almost like I'm treated with suspicion when I walk into the lobby. So, I will move my account to a more user friendly bank in the very near future and will likely search Wallet Hub for the best bank with the best customer service. I have other accounts with some great banks, but would like to add a new bank to my portfolio.","1539":"I switched to Bank of America when my husband and I got married. I've only experienced one hiccup in the 2 years that I've been a checking customer. My account was charged a monthly checking fee in error, and when I contacted customer service it was immediately reversed. We have our checking account linked to our savings which makes it convenient to transfer money back and forth when necessary. We also love that we can bank primarily online, rather than having to go inside a local bank. Our checking account is free of monthly charges as long as we use direct deposit, and we get excellent rewards on our cash back card, that is also linked to our account. Overall I'm very pleased with banking at Bank of America.","1391":"I have been with Bank of America for about 5 years now and have been pleased with their service. I was recently hit with a fraud attempt on my check card and they were able to tell that the authorization was not in my usual pattern and alert me that there was an issue. I was able to call in and they were able to reverse the charge, cancelled my current card and sent a new card to me. I also enjoy using their mobile banking application on my iPhone. It makes it very easy to check my spending history and to transfer funds to my girlfriend's Bank of America account.","463":"My parents suggested that I should sign up for rewards cards for students when I started college. They thought it would be helpful in giving me discipline as I begin my adult life. Boy were they right. The interest rate is alright unless you get caught up in penalties. That's when you get in trouble. It becomes beyond outrageous. I use to get a lot of cash advances to help me with simple purchases. I quickly stopped when I saw the interest rate that was attached to it. Overall, this card is good for young people who will do the right thing and keep their hands out of the penalty zone.","1399":"This credit card is actually very good surprisingly. After hearing all the negative feedback about BoA, I was a bit afraid of getting this card. But, due to the 100$ cash back bonus offer and the rewards, I tried it out. Having used this card for about a a year now, it has steadily improved my credit. And furthermore, the 3% back on gas is great. Having to drive 20 miles everyday, I've been fairly content with BoA's rewards. Also, because of the massive amounts of purchasing I do online, I'm exhilarated at the fact that I get 1% back with every purchase for this card. Though like all credit cards you have to make sure to pay off everything by the end of the month. And if you do that, this card will truly be a wonderful addition to your life.","1398":"I loved this card. It was my credit card ever and I got it when I first turned 18 and was approved for $1000. When I first received it I used it frivolously. I bout silly unneeded items like a new cell phone and an iPod Touch. I also did alot of cash advances. Once I realized how all those action were efecting my monthly payment I quickly paid them off and started being wiser with my choices. This card helped me raise my credit score that had been damaged by a family member stealing my identity. I loved the rewards, especially the 3% for gas. I used to drive all the time so that was very beneficial.The card is amazing and I loved how easy it was to pay.","460":"I have had this card for almost a year, and I really think it is a good first card for students. It is very easy to use. It is also very easy to quickly pay your credit card statements electronically. You can buy groceries using your credit card, and when you get home, pay for them immediately, especially if you have a Bank of America checking account. This feature allows one to keep track of the amount that adds up on the card more systematically, instead of paying a bill once a month, keeping track of payment dates, and keeping track of spending over the course of an extended period of time. The only confusing aspect of this credit card is the rewards, I am still unsure how rewards are acquired and redeemed, but I didn't chose this card for this feature.","461":"I didn't really have a credit history so I decided to give this a try. Surprisingly, the terms are ok if you just pay within the 25 day grace period. Otherwise like other posters have commented the fees are going to get crazy. Treat any credit card, including this one, as if it was a debit card, making sure to only spend what you can pay off, and you will be on your way to living a sane financial life and having a lot less worry overall about your finances. I honestly don't have any real issues with this card, it's a simple card meant to build your credit and get you in the habit of paying it off on time. If you don't have a stable income or way to pay off your balance, don't get a credit card until you can save up a cash cushion, at least in my opinion. I've banked with Bank of America since forever and it's definitely convenient and a safer alternative to cash to carry around. (Pay off your balance on time! It'll save you so many headaches, any potential new card-holders! There are minimum interest fees, late fees, all this crazy stuff. There is no grace period of not getting charged interest for any of the cash advance or similar things, either!) Take care!","462":"I have been using this card since my freshman year in college. I am now a graduate student. I got this card because I wanted an easy way to increase my credit score through a credit card. I keep the limit low ($1000) and use it mainly in online purchases to keep my debit card safe. It was actually tied to my xbox account which was hacked and the card was charged multiple times from that account. I contacted the support and the charges were rescinded immediately and I received a new card within a few days. I always pay off my monthly statement so I incur no penalties or interest fees. Being able to pay off the credit card through my bank account is super easy and convenient. I would definitely recommend this card to any students looking to get their credit score up.","464":"I have had this Bank of America card since I was 18 years old, I'm 26 now, it was my first credit card. It was called a Clout card back then, Bank of America bought them out a few years ago. My experience with this card has been overall pretty good. It came with a high interest rate of about 22%. I've developed good credit and over time, Bank of America has extended my credit limit several times. I've called to try and get the interest rate lowered, but they declined to do so. Other than the interest rate, this has been a really great card that has gotten me through some tough times.","465":"I have had this card for a little over a year, and I'm very happy with it. My mortgage was sold to Bank of America, and that provides an extra benefit, of a sort. When I accrue my cash back bonus, I apply it to my mortgage as an extra payment. This is a fantastic benefit!I especially like that the card offers a larger percentage back on gas because I commute 24 miles to work each way. I have an extremely efficient vehicle, but I fuel up once a week now that I commute, and every penny back adds up.I refuse to shop at WalMart, so unlike some other reviewers, I do not get the benefit of the extra \"grocery\" purchase on any and all purchases from this mega-retailer, but I'm okay with that. Now that I'm aware of that, I will check into the possibility that that works for Super Target or our regional equivalent, Meijer.I have had no problems with the card, and I'm basically satisfied with it. When traveling outside of the country, I use a different card that has a lower fee for processing a foreign currency exchange, but in the States, it's my go-to card.","466":"This credit card was the 2nd one that I had ever applied for. I had used Bank of America as my banking company for over 5 years but I had yet to set up a credit card through the company. My credit rating was rated as \"Poor\" at the time so I figured I didn't even have a chance of getting this card. Fortunately for me, not only was I approved for the card but I was given a limit I was floored by. $2500!I have used the card intelligently, paying off my balance monthly, and I have improved my credit drastically with this card. The rewards are also significant and impressive. They are 1% for everything, 2% for groceries, and 3% for gasoline. I don't drive very often but the 3% return makes me a little easier about filling up the tank whenever I do. The best part about the rewards program is that if you have a checking account with Bank of America, you get a 10% bonus on the reward that you can deposit straight into your checking account!All in all, this card has been perfect. Great rewards, large limit, no hassle when having to pay it, and exceedingly easy to use.5\/5 from me.","467":"I used Bank of America for years and then after a few bad experiences with customer service and outrage over fees, I switched banks. The grass was not greener at the local bank I tried. I did business with them for over a year and had a lot of technical issues with their online banking and ATMS, plus a lot of other irritations. I switched back to Bank of America, admittedly the Hello Kitty bankcard and checks were the final pull I needed. I have had nothing but good experiences with them since. The fees are a little higher, yes, but I know see the difference in quality. Whether it's online, over the phone, at the ATM or every once in a while the drive up teller, I get quality service.","2290":"I thought I canceled my BoA checking account about five years ago, but a few months ago, I got a letter stating that my account had been overdrawn by $9. How this happened when I thought I didn't even still have an account let alone checks or a debit card was beyond me. Busy with work and school it took me a few months to take care of the issue and BoA fined me for every month I didn't pay and threatened to report me to creditors. When I tried to call, about 3 months later, I couldn't get ahold of a customer service representative. Finally, I just accessed my bank account by phone, where my reported account balance was $0. BoA had credited the money back to me that month. So I guess the moral of the story is MAKE SURE your account is really canceled, unless you want to go through unnecessary hassle.","2062":"This was the first bank I used when I got my checking account as a college freshman. I feel like I was taken advantage of because of my age and soon fell prey to overdraft charges galore. My bank was definitely not clear about explaining the overdraft process to me, even taking fifty dollars every month out of checking and putting it into my savings, and then charging overdraft fees. Customer service was average; tellers were polite and professional, if not entirely forthcoming. There are branches all over the country, so access is never a problem. Problems with your account are adequately resolved, but you must stay on top of it yourself. Don't expect warnings or advice.","2060":"What did it for me with Bank of America, is the completeness of the online banking experience. As a Ph.D. student in Austria, it'd be really hard for me to stop by the branch for any reason at all... And I really didn't have to yet, and it's been over two years. Now, other banks will try to persuade you, that this is also the case with them... Well, Bank of America is the third major bank I gave a try to, and the only reason I dropped previous two, is precisely that: the lack of a *complete* online experience, giving you full control over everything in your account.","2330":"I've had a checking account with Bank of America for as long as I remember (10+ years) and I've always been pleased with their customer service. The checking account that I have offers me rewards through US Airways, which has been great though I believe they are discontinuing those benefits going forward. For those of you that have been charged fees for various reasons, I recommend you call the 1-800 customer service phone line and complain about it. Every time I have done that, I have been able to speak with a representative who eventually always concedes and credits my account with the funds.","2069":"I have been a happy customer with Bank of America for the past 5 years. I have a savings and checking account with this bank and they treat me very well. They are professional and work very hard to resolve any issues that I may have. When I would have a discrepancy on my account they help me fast to solve the problem without causing me any harm. If I call them over the phone or walk into the branch they are helpful and always willing to make sure that I get the proper care. I'm glad to be a customer with Bank of America.","2068":"I had a checking account with Bank of America for three years. My experience was mostly positive, although there was one negative issue. Being one of the largest banks in the nation, they gave me a sense of security. The only problem I ran into was when I was on a vacation and my account was put on hold. I found out it was because there had been a lot of hotel charges which they thought looked suspicious. It was very inconvenient for me, because I couldn't contact them at the time I found out about the hold, and I couldn't use my debit card in the meantime. I think they went too far in trying to protect the security of my account. Other than that, my experience with Bank of America was good. It was always very easy to get account information over the phone. They made me feel in control of my finances.","2067":"I have been a pretty happy customer of Bank of America for nearly 4 years now. Since I have started a Student checking account with them, they have been very excellent for all of the time I have been with them. The only problem that I have had with them was getting an overdraft fee, although that was a fault of my own and I was able to get it resolved very quickly. The other service that I am very pleased with is their online banking. Allows me to take care of pretty much everything I need. Overall I am very satisfied with my experience with BoA.","2066":"Hello Wallet Hub. Ok, so Bank of America is a great bank. Especially the division in my town. They are incredibly friendly and ready to help you with anything. The only problem I've come across with them is that sometimes they are 'too' friendly. What I mean is I have a large family and we all work together in a family business. So we all have the same last name which happens to be a name from Sicily. Also because we are from Sicily some of our first names might be a little confusing to native English speakers\/Americans. We all work and use the same work accounts and constantly transfer money from one work account to another and occasionally to a personal account. The problem is that a few times they have accidentally transferred money to the wrong account. I understand our names are confusing and that its hard to get that type of thing right over the phone but its not cool to try and make a big business purchase and have your check or debit card denied because your bank transferred the money to your brothers personal account instead of to the second work account. It looks bad to clients. Thankfully though the girls working their are super friendly and apologetic and work super fast to right their wrongs. Thanks Bank of America!","2065":"I personally have a Bank of America Ebanking checking and savings dual account. This account is great for me because I need access to a debit card and the ability to manage my account from anywhere in the country. By using Bank of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s online services I am able to get the flexibility I need from a bank account.Ebanking is free as long as you follow certain conditions. You have to get online statements otherwise you are charged a statement fee. Another somewhat annoying thing is that you have to use Bank of America ATMs or you get charged a monthly maintenance fee of $8, plus whatever the ATM fee is. This can be annoying, but it is avoidable. Bank of America ATMs offer deposits of checks and cash without envelopes and withdrawals. Since BoA ATMs are readily available in most cities, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a convenient way to do banking on the go.I've never had much contact with BoA representatives, because I've never had any real problems apart from one minor address mix up that did not stop the delivery of my mail. BoA usually takes less than the estimated time to clear checks, transfers and deposits. This is great because I know I'll have access to my money quickly.","2064":"I have been a customer of Bank Of America for several years. I can confidently tell you that Bank Of America is the most developed, safest and the most reliable bank that I have ever seen. I was impressed when I first came to this bank: excellent service, friendly environment, where everybody were kind and eager to help you, made me feel very positive. Their service and conditions are very beneficial for my financial state.Representatives of their customer service are connoisseur and always try to offer customers acceptable decisions. I also believe that the leadership of the bank try to base on high standard moral conduct with customers because almost every offer and conditions are very \"customers oriented\" . Stability and high interest rates are guarantee of successful relations with Bank Of America, overall, I recommend this bank to others.","2063":"I've been a Bank of America customer for over 10 years now. When I moved to California for grad school, I needed a bank that had conveniently located branches in both California and North Carolina, and BoA fit the bill.I usually bank online or use the ATM, and I especially like the ability to include a scan of any checks I deposit right on my receipt when I deposit them at an ATM.When I have had to call them with an issue, they have always been responsive and professional and have taken care of the issue with very little hassle.I now also have their rewards credit card, and I love it! It gives 3% back on gas, 2% back on groceries and 1% back on everything else. The rewards really are percentages, not just points, and they are payable in cash in increments of $25. In additional, if you have your rewards deposited into your BoA checking or savings account, you earn an extra 10%, making each payout $27.50.In addition, I use their Add It Up website when making online purchases from many of my favorite retailers, which averages another 4% to 10% back.I would still be paying the same amount for my purchases and would be simply throwing money away if I didn't take advantage of reward and rebate programs, and I find BoA's to be the most convenient, with good percentages and the shortest wait-time before I get my refunds.","2061":"Bank of America is truly America's most convenient bank for one reason, only. They have amazing ATMs. The User Interface is quite simple and straightforward, they can do virtually anything, and transactions go through until 8pm. I love the bank for this very reason. It has been a year since I have even stepped inside one of the bank branches because the ATM does everything for me.I do have some problems. I am distraught with the state of banking in the US today. Not only Bank of America, but all major banking institutions in this country are horribly immoral and unethical. This is why I have been attempting to switch to a federal credit union. However, it is very difficult to say goodbye to the convenience of Bank of America.","2427":"I have been banking at Bank of America for over two years and have been completely satisfied with my checking account. I like that I have a no fee checking account. The bank tellers are all really nice and helpful. My online banking updates really fast after a withdrawal or a deposit so I can stay up to date on my account balance. I also really like their keep the change program which transfers my change from each purchase to my savings account. It has really helped me save money over the last two years. I will continue to bank with Bank of America.","2331":"I signed up for a Bank of America checking account when I moved to the Boston area as there were no PNC banks in the area. I only use this account for basic transactions, such as an occasional deposit and ATM transactions. When I first signed up I was shocked to find out that they didn't have a free checking account without meeting one of several requirements. One of which was automatic deposits, so I set that up and went about my business. A year or so later I received something in the mail saying they were changing their requirements and account types. They automatically switched me to a higher account level, with much more rigorous requirements that I was not able to meet and as a result I was paying $15 per month in fees. I went to a branch to get it resolved and they told me the only other option to avoid fees was to switch to an electronic only account, which meant I had to pay for each transaction with a teller. Needless to say I was very disappointed in this option and as a result I have taken my business elsewhere. I have also had business accounts with them in the past and come across similar fee issues, such as charging me to make change.","2420":"I just recently opened a checking account with Bank of America for small business purpose. The customer service, as well as the application process, was great. I discussed my goals, activity, as well as business purpose with the bank's employee, and I felt that BoA would be a good choice. I have a number of other bank accounts for various purposes, and so far feel that BoA matches up very well. In terms of disclosures, I felt that there was some confusion at times, but due to a helpful staff, and seemingly proper conflict resolution, my doubts were set to ease. Also, BoA is very prominent in my area with his helpful for both my business, as well as my employees. Overall, I would recommend BoA, but would most likely recommend Schwab due to my personal usage.","2422":"When I visited Bank of America for the first time I opened an account to receive direct deposit for my SSI check. I did not know that if I was referred by someone I could get an incentive (in cash) and also the person who referred me as well. So I lost the opportunity though my mom had referred me to that bank. The lady that attended me was very nice and informative but I was also disappointed that there were no more Hello Kitty debit cards left which was something I was looking forward to. They offered me coffee and I tasted some but unfortunately it was awful. I was disappointed as well to know they do not open on Saturdays unlike my last bank did. I am though very pleased with the online banking and if my check is scheduled to be received on a Sunday I receive it 2 days in advance.","2424":"To be honest I hardly ever have to go inside my local Bank of America. Most of my banking matters can be handled quickly and easily either online or at the atm. The very few times I have ever gone inside my local bank everything was handled relatively easily, minus a few trips back and forth to collect paperwork. Other than that everything's always made pretty simple...I wish my mother had made finances so simple.I also have my business account with Bank of America. I've only ever had to make quarterly visits to obtain records. The staff is always helpful and efficient. I travel a lot for my job as well. Managing my accounts at various banks has made my life so much easier and I can get funds from clients immediately into the bank and sent to everyone it needs to go to.","2425":"Anyone searching to find a reliable checking and\/or savings account, Bank of America will be your best choice. Bank of America proves to be trustworthy. An incident with my checking account occurred about seven months ago at which point I was a victim of fraud. My checking account was overdrawn with a negative $1,200 balance. Apparently, someone tried buying merchandise using their online PayPal account with my personal checking account. I was shocked to know this had happened to me and called Bank of America immediately. After a very frustrating but reasonable time, my checking account was brought back to a positive balance. Surely, I was a very delighted customer and still use my Bank of America checking and savings account for all my financial needs. Bank of America has sustained to be devoted to it's customers.","2426":"It takes a lot to be successful at Bank of America as a Customer. I had to be driven, self motivated, goal-oriented, detail oriented, can handle stress, etc. I am satisfied with having my checking account with Bank of America. All associates are really helpful and resolve our queries very quickly. Strong growth and strong roots, its a company that will be here to stay! Pay for performance with the incentive plan with uncapped opportunity in sales metrics!!! All of the tools and resources I need to be successful are always in my hands as a BofA customer.","2428":"I've been with Bank of America for going on 10 years now. I was previously with Wachovia and switched over due to attractive credit card opportunities. I enjoy the personal service I get every time I go in, polite greeter and short lines. I like how the ATM is 24hours and inside it's own room so it's only accessible to Bank of America customers after dark. The credit card I currently have is nice, offering rewards based on what I spend money on. To date I've earned over 300 dollars in cash back and I've only had the card for about 6 months. I've been with other banks but all-in-all I will probably stick around with Bank of America for a long time.","2429":"Very good institution. The associates at my particular branch are always smiling and friendly. The bank manager is easy to deal with when I needed something. If I had a complaint, it would be with the building itself which is getting a bit old and dated. B of A has been very fair with me.","479":"I am currently a college student and I started out with a Bank of America account for college since they have an ATM\/banking service available on site and on campus. As far as charges and the like go, I personally have my own debit card and the balance requirement is $0. However the monthly charge can be a bit of a killer for a college student. If you get an ebank account though I guess they waive the fee but I am not 100% sure about the details. The application process was typical and easy. I haven't really had to use customer service\/call them yet so I can't give a complete rundown of what their customer service is like.","478":"I have a Bank of America savings account because before I decided on a college to attend I wanted to have access to a large bank with ATMs and branches across the nation. Bank of America was a big enough bank to fill that role. Unfortunately I did not need the country wide access to Bank of America because I ultimately stayed home for college. In any case Bank of America has good tellers that provide enough information to their customers. Their policies are much like any other bank so it's very much the same. The only problem is that here in Hawaii they aren't as many branches as the local banks (BOH, CPB, ASB, etc.). When I do travel to the mainland I do use their branches as needed though so that is a plus.","477":"I opened a checking account with Bank of America when I started undergrad. The rates were the best available for a person in my position at that time (18, no credit history, etc.). I am now starting law school, and because I have been a loyal BoA customer, they have helped me secure my student loans. The ATMs are top-notch, the customer service unparalleled, and the conflict resolution is almost always perfect.","476":"I was with Bank of America before Wells Fargo came to my town a few years ago. I can tell you that they were great at times and awful in others. They were always very tech savvy and I could access many useful services for checking online and through apps on my iPhone. However, they did not value me as a customer and their customer service was poor. I felt like I always got the run around whenever I had a question for someone.I absolutely loved their checking features though. I would simply take pictures of my checks for deposit and this made banking so simple for me with such a busy schedule. They are not a very traditional company and there is no lost love to have my business somewhere else. I would not recommend them to others.","475":"I have had a checking and savings account with Bank of America for about 4 years. I currently have the eChecking account, so I do not go into the bank anymore and am waived the monthly fee. The day to day service of Bank of America is convenient and hassle free. However, when you have a problem, that's when you'll find dealing with them annoying. I had an identity theft problem and the person had emptied my account and put me in a -$900 balance. I called the bank immediately and they gave me all the information on what I needed to to, however, it took them over a month to do their part. They never processed my papers and I would get weekly phone calls about my account being in foreclosure and would keep having to explain that it was NOT my fault, and that my papers weren't being processed. In summary, I spent a month with a frozen bank account and no money, which as a college student, isn't easy. They eventually reimbursed me. However, a week later, the identity thief applied for a credit card in my name at a Bank of America. They were about to approve it, and gave me a phone call to confirm some employment information with me....when I told them that I didn't apply for the credit card and that was an identity theft problem, they refused to give me the address that was written on the application for the credit card IN MY NAME. They withheld information that would have exposed the identity thief to me. Overall, I have been dissatisfied by the services of Bank of America, but only stay with them for the convenience they provide.","474":"Bank of America was recommended to me by a co-worker when I mentioned that I was looking for a new bank. I was able to open both a checking and savings account online easily and also pay all of my bills and view the balances for utilities and student loans. I signed up for their \u201cKeep the Change\u201d program so that all of my debit card purchases are rounded up to the nearest dollar and the change is deposited into my savings account. I can even see my stock information on the website. I love that it\u2019s all in one place, on one site. A week after I signed up, a Bank of America rep even called to make sure everything was going well and to see if I have any questions. What great customer service! I am very happy.","473":"I have a Bank of America checking and savings account as well as a Chase credit card. I have recently stopped using my BoA debit card online for security reasons. A few months ago I was visiting Pittsburgh with my boyfriend when I received a call that my Bank of America account had been temporarily put on hold and that I had to call for details. I called and was informed that there was an investigation being conducted and that my account was at risk for being hacked. The customer service agent took my new address to mail another card to and told me it would arrive before the end of the following week. Overall, the process was handled well, although I was put out because there is not one Bank of America branch within 25 miles of Pittsburgh. I got my new card several days later and everything has been fine since.","472":"I have recently been searching for a new online checking account since my previous bank when it came to online was less than what we wanted. So far, we've been very impressed with Bank of America. The application process was simple and online. They mailed all the necessary cards and even a single check, deposit slip and direct deposit form, along with the check card. I have been extremely impressed.Their ATM's are state of the art and money posts immediately to your account. I also like that in addition to the online features they also have a brick and mortar bank, even near to us in our very rural farm land!","471":"I\u2019ve been using Bank of American for a few years now. Despite what I\u2019ve heard on the news, I\u2019ve had good experience using this bank. I have both a savings and checking accounting and I do most of my banking online. I must be having great luck at talking to decent customer service representatives because if I have any problems, they are willing to help me any way they can. I once had a purchase that charged twice and they fixed it right away. The most important part about having an account with any bank is to keep an eye on your money. It feels good to know that if I do find something wrong, it\u2019ll be fixed right away.","470":"I've had a Bank of America Checking Account for over six years and I have to say, I absolutely love banking here. The people at my local branch are extremely helpful and friendly, making everything super easy. When I have questions they always give me quick and correct answers that are best of all, easy to understand. The loan officers and general customer servicemen help with your each and every need.My no checking fee account makes this bank way better than other banks. My CD here has one of the best rates I've ever seen around. Some banks I have issues with because their pay system is glitchy, but I have never had any issues with B of A. I will be a proud Bank of America customer for years and years and recommend all my friends and family.","469":"I've been a customer of Bank of America for four years now. I use the mobile application too. I've never had any issues with this bank. The tellers are always friendly and smiling. The mobile application is VERY user friendly. It lets you check account balances, transfer between your accounts, locate ATMs and branches, and do many other basic features. The student accounts are great because they offer free services for 5 years whether you're a student during those 5 years or not. Overall, I'm very satisfied with Bank of America. I would recommend this bank to both students and anyone looking for a basic checking or savings account.","468":"I opened a Bank of America account about a year and a half ago. I only opened a checking account for the sole purpose of having my tenant (who also had a Bank of America account) be able to electronically pay his rent into my account through electronic transfers. Thus, the account was limited to electronic use only. I didn't realize that Bank of America was going to be so critical with fees. There were a couple of times where my tenant submitted a check instead of having the rent electrically transferred from his account to mine. I was very disappointed that on both counts I was charged a fee for the tenant not adding the money electronically. Instead of automatically being penalized, there should have been a warning. The reason I hadn't gotten a regular checking account in the first place was because I thought there were too many fees involved. Also, it was difficult to reach their customer service over the phone and took to long to wait for a person to come on the line.","2332":"Bank of America has been a pretty good bank so far. Some experiences I've had with the bank are good examples of great customer service. For example, there was a time where my debit card number was stolen, and illegal purchases were made linked to my account at various convenience stores. I immediately called Bank of America and was directed to their fraud hotline. Within minutes, my representative changed my account, told me I would be receiving a new debit card (which I received a day later), and told me that the charges would be investigated to determine if I would have to pay. Within a week, I received a letter stating that I was not at fault, and would therefore not have to pay for any of the charges illegally made.Off the top of my head, the only bad thing I can think of in regards to my Bank of America account is the fact that there is a charge for my checking account being in a low balance per month. I have never had any other bad experiences with the bank. There are plenty of banks and ATMs in my general vicinity so I can withdraw money without penalties (which are clearly stated). Some may view that as inconvenient, but in general I feel as they do a good job in terms of the basic banking services I require.","2421":"I have been using Bank of America ever since I was old enough to have my own accounts, debit card, and credit card. Each location seems to have friendly employees who are ready to help . A few times I have gone in with problems, whether it be transfers not working or needing some advice, and every time I have left with a pleasant feeling due to the trip. I would recommend everyone switch to this bank if they are looking for a new one. Applications are easy, customer service is great, overall it is a great chain. On top of all of that, there are countless locations, seemingly in any place I have been to. I never have trouble finding an ATM where I will not be charged extra due to it not being my bank. I can also always find branches so I can go in and talk to people who understand my questions. The only problem I have had with Bank of America is the times the banks themselves are open makes it hard for someone who works to go to them.","2423":"When I first decided to sign up with Bank of America I was excited because I would have access to my accounts from anywhere around the country. About a month after using the bank I was very disappointed. Everything is scattered and I never know when I'm allowed to spend my money. I am constantly getting notices for being overdrawn even though I know I have much more money available than what they say I have access to. I am very dissatisfied with Bank of America. If I didn't still have ties to a different state I would switch banks yesterday.","2335":"I've been banking with Bank of America for over 5 years, and I've had both negative and positive experiences. One aspect of Bank of America that has been a bit of an issue is the order in which they deduct the money from your account. Money is deducted from the account from highest to lowest causing a lot of small bounces for amounts like $1 or $2. One positive aspect is that occasionally they would forgive some of those bounces on the account. Also because of the large number of customers Bank of America mixes up bank cards, I've occasionally received 2 of the same cards. Bank of America is a decent bank but you must stay on top of your account to avoid a lot of unnecessary fees.","2334":"As a student finding the right checking account is key. Bank of America helped me a great deal when choosing an appropriate account. Since I did not make enough to hold the minimum balance in many of their main checking accounts, they introduced me to their E-Checking account. I was walked through step by step when it came to deposits and withdrawals. The customer service was amazing and respectful. I would recommend Bank of America to any and all college students looking for a great checking account without dealing with unnecessary fees.","2336":"Bank of America is THE worst credit card company I deal with! Their interest rate is horribly high, even though I have requested many times over the past couple of years for them to reduce it because, in spite of the economy, I have a solid job and an excellent credit rating. They simply do not care. I have a $20,000+ balance on this card but I have never missed a full payment and I often pay more than the monthly balance due. I stopped using this card over a year ago and have just steadily paid down my balance in an effort to rid myself of it completely. Their telephone customer service people are rude and, in all honesty, rather ignorant of what their company's products even ARE. I have spoken many times with BofA's customer service department and, each and every single time, have had to go through a least a couple people before I could be connected with someone who actually knew what I was asking about enough to answer questions. And, even then, they were terse and obstructive. It is just so VERY frustrating to have to even DEAL with Bank of America! They are the poster company for greed!","2337":"I have been a Bank of America customer since 2009. I chose the bank because of its ATM network, and their presence in areas where I travel frequently. Bank of America's customer service is good, and their network of ATM's are great, but their banking policies and fees leave much to be desired. I'm not a fan of jumping through their hoops to avoid checking fees, and the hassles of disputing transactions. Many people are not happy with Bank of America'\u0080\u0099s services; however the people on the customer service line are courteous and incredibly helpful. Even though Bank of America is a big bank with questionable practices, they are the best of the big banking groups.","2338":"My experience with Bank of America has been excellent. Reading through some of these other reviews seems to misrepresent them a bit. While I'm sure different locations have different customer service, all the locations I've been to have always been friendly. All this being said, they don't seem to get in much of a hurry at any of the branches I've been to. There are often lines of 3 or 4 people that you have to wait through, but when you think about it that's usually a good thing. If there are people waiting in line to deposit their money, then the bank must be a great place to put your money. I live in the city so I'm sure that rural locations may have much faster service. Overall, I can't find anything else to complain about. They're just a good safe place for my money.","2339":"I would not recommend Bank of America to anyone. I have my mortgage with them and I can't get out of this anytime in the near future. Ive had a checking account with them and was really surprised at how unprofessional they can be!! Many of my friends have also had very bad experiences with Bank of America such as charging them unexpected fees, ect. You would hate to get a huge overdraft fee for just going over by a few cents. I have overdraft protections so this isn't an issue for me but the impression I get is that they view the customers as a way to make extra money by picking any extra fees they can out of them. I believe it has just got worse with the passage of credit reform laws also. Also, just because you do business with them does not give them the right to have their people call you nonstop at odd hours trying to sell stuff or services! Even after asking them to not call me they still continue to call. If you would like a bank to call you multiple times about nothing, then go ahead and sign up with them.","2333":"I opened an account at Bank of America a few months before I started college. I've never had any issues with this bank; last year I accidentally overdrew from my checking account and they helped set me back in the black with no hassle whatsoever. It's a great bank and I'm very satisfied with them. One of my favorite services that the bank offers is the Keep The Change program, which allows me to receive money when I spend money with my bank card. My card is also attached to the Humane Society so that when I spend, I also donate money to that charity. Bank of America has covered all of the bases.","2291":"I have been doing business with Bank of America for about four years, and my wife and I had always paid our bills through the online banking. We had recently come into some money so we opened a Money Market account. We thought this was great and we were looking forward to watching the money pile up. However, we were never told that there was a maintenance fee if you went over six transactions and the rate was horrible less than .5 percent. After about six monthes we took our money out of this account and opened a new account at a local credit union and didn't have to pay fees and the rate was better. The biggest problem we faced is that it took us three times to close the account, each time we would go in and attempt to close it and they would tell us it was fine. However, we kept getting hit with maintenance fees for having a low balance. Finally, after six monthes we were able to close the account. This bank gave us horrible service and acted each time like we were the problem.","2298":"I registered and obtained this credit card when I first opened an account with Bank of America. I have never had a credit card that earned Cash Rewards and getting 1% back for every purchase I make has been excellent. I generally use my balance to help pay-off my credit card; however, after saving over $300 dollars I was rewarded an additional 25% ($75 dollars) bonus when I deposited it into my checking account. My only criticisms with the card is that the original promotion only lasted 6 months, and that the money can only be utilized in $25 dollar increments. Aside from that I think it is a great card and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new credit card.","2297":"I've had my Bank of America Visa card since 2005. I applied for the card because I only had a Discover Card at the time and wanted a Visa that would be more widely accepted by merchants. I pay no annual fees on the card whatsoever (which I really like). I received a great introductory rate as a new applicant (for 6 months) and am periodically sent additional offers for really low APRs on balance transfers from other cards (as well as on cash advances), The standard APR I am charged is comparable with other cards and not too high, I feel. My card happens to be a variable rate (different from a set or non-variable rate so ask a representitave the difference if you don't know how it works) which means my rate can change. However, I don't mind this. It's seemed to work to my satisfaction over the years (andright now my rate is roughly 17-18%). I've always made my payments early or on time so I'm not sure what their penalty fees are. I can say that whenever I have needed them (especially a time or two when I was traveling overseas and called a representative for help) they have been there! Easy and reasonable card. No complaints here!","2296":"I really liked this card originally for one main reason.They gave me a key ring sized extra copy. Since I only carry my wallet when I'm drinking this was great because I always had my card when I needed it. Before this it could be at home, in my glove box, in my center console, who knows. Was losing that thing constantly!Now I am no longer happy at all. They started randomly charging me 3 bucks every few months and 12 dollars EVERY month for literally no reason. I can't figure out why they are doing this. Will most likely be closing this card and opening up an account somewhere more trustworthy.","2295":"This card has great rewards. The variety of cashback options makes it so easy to live college life. It encourages me to buy groceries over other things because of the cashback for groceries. Also, since it's affiliated with both Visa and Bank of America, I can use the card just about anywhere, which is great for a college student like myself since we seem to find ourselves just about anywhere and everywhere. I've never had a problem with customer service. Paying my bill is always fast, easy, and problem-free. They're also very accepting of a lack of credit rating, which was a problem for me when I first started applying for credit cards.","2294":"This card is great. It's the first and only credit card I have ever had, and I have no problems with it in the last couple of years. I make sure to pay my bills every month so I get good credit and all the perks of this card (if you don't pay it off, the interest negates the effect of the cash rewards). Getting cash rewards is really handy and really makes a difference in my budget, especially since I am getting rewards on things I would normally buy anyway such as gas and groceries. No complaints! I feel like I'm getting free money. As long as you pay the card off in full every single month, the bonuses are really worth it.","2293":"Love this card. With the cashback on groceries and gas, I use it every chance I get. As a college student, I'm driving everywhere, and I always need to get groceries. Plus, the cashback on everything is nice too; helps me get the stuff I need. I used the card to pay for books when I first got it, and ended up getting the 100 back bonus, which was really nice. I've not had a problem using this card anywhere, since it's Visa and Bank of America. With a max late fee of only 35$, this helps a lot when you're between paychecks and you see the bill come in the mail. I've only had to pay one late fee, but it was only 15. Great card to start off when you have no credit rating.","2299":"This credit card is quite nice. The 3-2-1 deal is actually more convenient than I thought it would be when I initially signed up for the card. I don't have the BoA checking account so I can't get the extra benefits, but it's still a great card! Works very well when I travel to other countries (which I do a lot)! The international transaction fee is minimal as compared with other cards. I think that this is a great overall card and extremely beneficial in many \"everyday\" situations. I would recommend this card as a starter card for teenagers as well as a handy extra card to keep in case of emergencies!","1070":"I have had this card for just under a year know and have never looked back. Every time I build up $25 in rewards I can cash out. It is a simple concept, and slowly by just purchasing things I already would I get free rewards. It gives 3% cash back on gas, 2% back on groceries and 1% back on simply everything you purchase. This is by far the best credit card I have ever owned. I would reccomend it to anyone. If you are looking for a simple easy to use credit card, with good benefits, this is the one for you. Try it and you will keep it.","2292":"I have been using this credit card for the past year and I must admit, it is pretty amazing. If you didn't already know, you get 3% cash back ON GAS. That's insane! I fill up my tank all the time because I love travelling and getting 3 cents back on every dollar is so rewarding.Don't forget about the groceries though, that's 2%. My wife shares the card with me and when ever she goes down to Wal Mart, she brings this bad boy and it's savings on top of savings. Bank of America is great, I have no complaints with them, and this card is really really great.","1074":"Bank of America is really easy to get an account with, and their service is pretty awesome. I haven't had an account for very long, but for the short time I have had it, there have been no problems. I've had a few problems, but they were all caused by my own mistakes, such as not watching my account close enough, and getting hit with an overdraft fee. Overall, I would recommend Bank of America to anyone who is looking for a great bank to start out their banking career with. They are great to their customers and provide exceptional service.","1073":"I was a customer for about 8 years from 2002 when I got my first job at 16, until 2010 when I lost my job for a while, and started having issues with the bank. They were great in the sense that I never had any other issues like fraud or problems with holds or anything like that, but what happened after I lost my job, made me lose my faith in BofA's customer service.I had some money going in and out of my bank, but my ISP kept charging me for a service I no longer had and billing issues that I tried to cancel many times, therefore it was really their fault, but BofA didn't help me at all to resolve this. They allowed my service provider to continue to charge me monthly after I had put a block on them, and they overdrew my account every month, and BofA told me they couldn't do anything about it if they didn't stop charging me themselves. This went on for about 4 months, where every time my ISP would apologize and say it was the last time, but every time they lied. I tried closing my account while I figured out a new job situation, but the charges from the ISP kept reopening my account, which I think is a terrible thing after having explained my problem to the bank with the ISP. Of course they don't care, though. They just want their money, I suppose. I understand it, but I lost my faith in them. They didn't help me when I needed it most. They were okay, and good before this, but I think this got out of hand.","1072":"I once had a very hard time finding the right kind of checking account for me. Other banks gave me so much hassle I didn\u2019t know what to do. The late fees and overdraft fees were ridiculous. Bank of America is different; this is a bank that specializes in providing excellent service to everyday people. There are many benefits to opening a checking or savings account with Bank of America and I enjoy all of them. Their customer service is second to none and they offer easy application and issue resolution. I couldn\u2019t be happier with this bank and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for dependable service.","1071":"When I signed up for a checking account with Bank of America, they were extremely friendly and I was set up with an account very quickly. They worked with me to explain all of the terms and conditions that came along with the account. I've heard that they have a harsh overdraft penalty but I've not had to deal with them in that regard. They are very friendly in person and I appreciate that they have locations all over the country. Their ATMs are very accessible and more numerous than their bank locations, in some instances. I've been baking with Bank of America for about 4 years now and I would not consider switching, since they are so customer-friendly and they have so many locations nationwide.","2070":"One of the worst banks out there. They are completely focused on making a profit and getting every last cent possible out of their gullible, readily victimized (in their view) customers, and as such will use every excuse to charge you the most fees possible for no good reason (for example, forcing you to avoid using teller service in order to avoid a fee). Their staff are cold, unfriendly and have no enthusiasm for their jobs, which is to be expected for as heartless an institution as Bank of America. In addition, a quick search will bring up numerous horror stories of people abused by Bank of America. Avoid this bank at all costs!","2071":"I've been with Bank of America since I first opened a bank account with my father at the age of 16. Since then, I've had nothing but good experiences. Customer service has always been great. They were one of the first to update their ATMs to have a great interface that reads checks and can take cash immediately without needing to put it in an envelope. And although I don't have it, I love that they let you put your picture on your debit card as a security precaution. I would highly recommend Bank of America to anyone else especially as I have never had any issues finding their ATMs while traveling across the country multiple times (or partners that accept Bank of America).","1339":"My experiences, for the most part, with Bank of America have been quite good. The tellers and service reps in any branch I've visited have, in almost all cases, been prompt, courteous, and helpful, as well as competent. When I was unfortunate enough to encounter an overdraft, the service reps in my usual branch were very helpful in addressing and solving the problem, as well as find the \"right account for me,\" to reduce the possibility of a occurrence, as well as save me money on fees. They do a fine job, I find of helping tailor their service to the individual customer's needs. I'm confident, based on prior experience, that my future experiences with them will be very positive as well.","1338":"I have been a Bank of America customer for about 3 years now. I have both a savings & checking account. There are definitely some pluses with this bank. I love the fact that you can deposit checks (up to 10 at a time) and cash (up to 20 bills at a time) right at their ATMs. I also like the online banking and their mobile phone app as these make it super easy to keep up with my account. They are a bit crazy with their overdraft fees. They take out the largest amount first, then the smaller amounts. If you have $50 left in your account and debits for $5, $10 and $60 post on the same day, the $60 will come out first, followed by the smaller 2 amounts. Therefore, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get hit with three $35 NSF fees. I wish they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d consider their customers a little more and, in these situations, take out the smaller amounts first, then the large amount because then, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d only get hit with 1 NSF fee.","2072":"My experiences with Bank Of America have always left me completely satisfied. Bank Of America employees have always been pleasant, understanding, and informative. As a student in NYC, banking seemed like a foreign language to me, however BOA has helped me gain and utilize valuable banking information. They have helped me in times of serious rotten luck (I have managed to lose my wallet with my banking card and identification card quite a bit) and helped me keep my head up high. They really work with you to bring satisfaction to any customer! As a customer of BOA I highly recommend their services.","2073":"I've never had a problem with Bank of America. I have had a checking account with them for about 6 years and have never incurred any surprise fees or encountered any other problems. I love the fact that there is an ATM practically wherever I go, so I hardly ever have to pay ATM fees. The Bank of America in my neighborhood is very convenient and the tellers are always friendly. I have lost my credit card a couple of times and it is very easy to have a new one sent to me by filling out a form online. Online banking in general is very handy and makes it easy to keep track of my banking. As long as I pay my bills on time, I anticipate no problems with Bank of America.","2074":"I absolutely love banking with Bank of America. They are always extremely helpful whenever I have any questions or concerns. I love that they have so many branches. When I travel I don't have to worry about whether or not I will be able to access my money. Their online banking is pretty great as well. I like that I can check my balance without having to call or go to the bank. I have never been charged a fee when it wasn't my own fault, and I have no doubt that if it was them that messed up that they would work with me. I love banking with Bank of America and don't foresee myself switching banks anytime soon.","2075":"I've been banking with Bank of America for two years. Their customer service is great. Every time I have an issue they are always helpful and do their best to solve my problem. I also like that you can chat with an associate right from your computer at any time. My only issue with them is that I opened my account in California and for some reason California accounts are managed separately from all other accounts so I had to talk to special representatives every time I needed to and it was difficult to get direct transfers from regular accounts to my account to go through correctly and on time. I think the issue is mostly resolved now though.","1332":"My identity has been stolen twice during my stay at Bank of America. The first time, they did not even catch it and I never got all of my money back in its entirety (just most of it) the second time they caught someone making withdrawals in Mexico (I have no idea how) and my money was returned after a week or so. But I had to fill out a lot of paperwork and I had to give a sworn statement over the phone that I had not been to Mexico recently (how about ever?!) and that I was not lying. I have NEVER over drafted my account on my own, only when my $$ was stolen so isn't that an indicator something is wrong? And I despise the fact that they are starting to charge for monthly statements in the mail, and discussing charges for checking accounts?? Crazy! I am looking for a good bank to switch to.","1077":"I've used Bank of America for years. They seem to be fully staffed and I never have to wait in line long. We set my son up with an account through them, but recently, he wanted to open a Roth IRA account, but he is only 16. The people we spoke to at this bank didn't know if he had to wait until he was 18 or not. It was a little confusing, but we found a bank that would allow it. Other than this incident, I've never had any issue with this bank. I still have my accounts with them.","1333":"Bank of America has been a solid bank in my opinion. I did not encounter any bad experiences with them. Furthermore, there was one incident in which I was charged for something I did not purchase, so I contacted their customer service and the manner was resolved easily. I also like how the bank cards they give out have your actual picture in them. It makes it more unique and less bland than other banks cards out there. I never had problems with their direct deposit service and never had any outages in which my balance became unavailable for no reason (as I had an experience like that with Wells Fargo in which I couldn't purchase things for a few hours since the service was unavailable). Overall, this is a good bank, especially if you meet the requirements to avoid bank fees.","1337":"I opened a personal checking account with them a while ago and it seems that while their policies keep getting more and more aggressive about fees charged, their customer service is the only thing that keeps me banking with them. Their monthly fees, overdraft fees, and so on are among the highest in class, but the fact that they have the most ATM\u2019s in the area and that I have had a few problems resolved very quickly by visiting tellers or calling their support hotline are what get me to stay. I remember one time I was able to get an overdraft fee reversed if I was willing to go in and pick up a little book to keep track of my credits and debits manually, which I thought was a really funny old-school idea but it has actually helped me out a bit. I guess the only complaint I have with them is that if their fees keep going up, people who overdraft a lot or don\u2019t read fine print are going to go broke. Please, please read the fine print and pay attention to your balances if you are just opening a bank account!","1078":"I have been banking with Bank of America for over 7 years. I have dealt with many branches from California to Georgia. My hometown branch has the worst speed of service that I have ever encountered. My only time to go to the bank is at lunch, since Bank of America closes before I get off work. There is always a large line with three tellers, at the most, helping customers. Most of the time they have two or three people in the lobby greeting customers, why not have one or two of them in the teller window to move people along? The only reason I still bank with Bank of America is that my wife likes the fact that they are a national bank and have locations across the nation. If I could find a better national bank, I would switch in a heartbeat.","2077":"I really like the fact that it seems no matter where I go, there is a branch that I can go to. They are very understanding and helpful with customer service. I have noticed a few \"odd\" charges on my account and questioned it. They are usually resolved in a quick fashion. Sometimes you do have to speak to a supervisor to get the charge reversed. I often wonder how many people don't notice the charges? My overall rating of this bank is a 4 because they do a good job. Better than some of the banks I have had in the past.","1079":"Bank of America has been very good when it comes to transactions. They always process very quickly and are very accurate. It has been very easy to deposit and withdraw money. It is very easy to access and the online banking is great. Making transfers online has been incredibly intuitive as well. However, I was given only 3 checks and it takes forever to receive the other ones. What is more, I was out of the country for 7 months and they just closed my checking account although I had previously let them know that I was not going to be here. And lastly, their telephone service and customer help on the telephone is very slow.","1336":"I chose to switch all of my banking in 2010 from HSBC to Bank of America. While utilizing HSBC I received several instances of poor customer service, and had had enough. I was referred to Bank of America by my wife, who already had several accounts open, promising an increase in performance by customer service, and better overall perks. The perks, such as cash back rewards, are vastly superior to the perks I received at HSBC.However, the customer service has been subpar to say the least. When I originally registered our accounts with Bank of America the computer systems were down. This caused what should have been a 20 minute application process take 2 hours. I was further aggravated the following week when I was informed that I would need to go back to Bank of America. The Customer Service Representative made numerous errors that required my presence to correct. Although this instance has left a sour taste in my mouth; I have found that my other experiences have been more positive. When calling customer service I always speak with a representative whose first language is English, and they do not try to sell me a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnew\u00e2\u0080\u009d customer package every time I call. In closing, I would recommend Bank of America if someone were to inquire about a good bank to trust their money with.","680":"I have been a customer with Bank of America since 2001. Overall, I have been very satisfied with my experiences that I have had with Bank of America. I have always been treated with respect and treated like a valued customer. I interact mostly with Bank of America's online customer service and their telephone customer service. I have never had a problem with having to wait too long to be helped or having a rude representative. It is obvious to me that Bank of America holds its employees at a very high standard and it shows through the way that they treat their customers.","681":"Their fees are pretty ridiculous-- they charge for everything from lost debit card to minimum balance to speaking to a teller. I got an account where as long as I do paperless statements and don't do teller transactions, the account is free. It's convenient since I have a lot of friends and family with Bank of America, I can transfer money to them quickly and free, and they have a ton of ATMs. The ATMs are snazzy, they read your checks and you can deposit cash in it and it counts the cash immediately. Website is weird but does the trick... not a GREAT bank, but it takes care of my simple needs.","1330":"I think that Bank of America\u2019s checking program is excellent! I signed up for a checking account last month and everything went smoothly. I had signed up for the account at my local branch and the people at the bank were very friendly and accommodating. They answered all my questions promptly and clearly. I even received a temporary debit card on the spot so that I could make transactions while I waited for my new debit card to arrive. I am very satisfied with their customer service and their online banking system. A week ago, Bank of America notified me of suspicious transactions and they were able to solve the problem very quickly. They were able to get my money back and issue me a new debit card. Overall, I would rate Bank of America a 5\/5 for their wonderful service.","1331":"The customer service at my Bank of America is EXCELLENT! I couldn't be happier with this bank. The staff are so friendly and everyone there knows me by name. I really feel like a valued customer, not just another number. They are always polite and helpful as well as very knowledgeable and ready to answer any questions I may have. They were extremely helpful to me when setting up my mortgage and were also very fair, which is hard to find with a bank these days! I'm glad I can count on the stability and excellent service that Bank of America has to offer.","682":"I switched to BofA from BB&T because they were always getting me with overdraft fees. They never credited my paycheck until the next day and would charge me overdraft when I stopped to get gas the day the check was supposed to post...but Bank of America lets you use your money instantly and if you have an issue there is someone who can fix it fast any time day or night. They will even refund a charge if you can explain what happened to them. I like the online banking because it is easy and fast. They have never charged me any additional fees. I also like to use their e-bills for bill pay. It is not automatic transfer because I like to review the bill before I pay it, but it e-mails you to let you know it is ready.","1335":"This bank is great for car loans. I went in with a credit score of only 600 and they approved me for a car loan. I didn't expect to get it but the customer service rep was great! She really helped me out. I would give this bank a 5\/5.","1334":"Bank of America and I have had a rocky relationship for the 6 years that I have been with the company. Originally I only had a checking account that I used during my 4 years of college in a different city. Many times I would overdraft my account by values less than $50, but they would order my transactions from most to least expensive, rather than in order of occurrence, in order to rack up overdraft fees. A simple call to the bank would usually suffice to get some overturned, but a lot of times they zinged me with these fees.Thankfully, everything else has been great, and now that I'm working a full time job and have a credit card with Bank of America, it could not be better. I'm happy with their customer service, although sometimes there are miscommunications, and online banking makes it very easy to keep track of my finances.","2076":"I was very interested in banking with Bank of America when they first came to my town. The use of new banking technology drew me towards Bank of America more than any other bank. Setting up my account was easy. Though, every time I went into the bank, I seemed to have to wait a long time and the tellers were not friendly. Whenever it was my turn, there were all these banking rules that I had never heard of before and after a while it just seemed like to much of a hassle to bank there. The service was terrible.","392":"I started banking with another bank that was taken over by Bank of America years ago and have been with them ever since. Here is why: about 10 years ago I was living in Queens, NY and I lost my wallet at the laundromat one night. I didn't realize it until the next morning, and when I called to report my debit card lost, the agent I spoke with went over my account transactions with me. It turns out my wallet had been \"found\" and the debit card had been used several times overnight to clean out my account. I told them the last transaction I remembered and they said they would investigate. I think I had to fill out and fax something back to them for the investigation. As the transactions rolled in they would put the money right back into my account. They also sent me a replacement debit card. About two weeks later I got a letter in the mail saying the charges had been investigated, my money had been restored and they were closing their file. It was just that simple. There were no additional charges to my account, no bounced checks or fees, and no hassles from Bank of America. That is why I am still a loyal customer to this day.","2078":"Bank of America gets a lot of guff for a lot of their policies. It's true that if the debit charge went into effect, it would have been a disaster. However I have not had many other problems with Bank of America. There are times when I run into random charges on my account. However I usually address them with the customer service representatives and get the matter resolved and the charge reversed. I also use the app, which is pretty handy and convenient. The problem I have with them is that I don't like what they stand for. I also don't trust them. With them losing money all of the time, I only imagine it is only a matter of time before they come up with other ways to charge their customers.","395":"Bank of America has not been a good bank for me. I have found their records keeping to be sloppy. Their customer service is slow and impersonal; I have been unable to develop any personal relationships with anyone who works at my branch. There are far too many fees for every little thing. The employees at the windows are not well trained and are very slow, and the lines are very long and this includes in the customer service area when waiting for a specialist. There is no guard posted by the Versateller unit. What bothers me the most is that the fees are raised on my checking and the rules are changed far too often.","2079":"I opened a Bank of America checking account before going off to college. They have a very good student deal for checking accounts and debit cards, with little to no fees. The ATMs are very convenient and you cannot beat the cash\/check deposit at the ATMs, especially since it is an instant deposit before 8 pm. The only problems I have had was when there were two pending charges which cleared so that I over drafted my account twice, instead of processing in the order of the purchases and only counting once. The online banking and bill pay have been very convenient, and I have never had a huge issue with these services.","399":"I've had a checking account with Bank of America for about 6 years now and have had little to no problems. I love how you can deposit checks at an ATM without an envelope or slip, and your receipt has a picture of the check you deposited on it. I live between Ohio and Massachusetts, and there are no Bank of America's in Ohio, but I am still able to transfer money and use that checking account when needed. However, in Massachusetts, there are ATM's everywhere and most of them you need your debit card to access, giving you some extra security. Overall, the bank has suited my checking account needs extremely well.","398":"Having been required by my college to sign up for a bank account for a direct-deposit transaction, I was pretty scared. I have had no past experiences with banks and even my mother is a bit skeptical about banks. A family friend, who worked at a local Bank of America, strongly recommended his bank. To this day, I am glad I made the decision to join Bank of America.Both he and the company were able to inform me of all the opportunities and even taught me all the tips, tricks and benefits of having a bank account. My transition into the 'banking world' was smooth and enjoyable, thanks to the friendly employees at the bank. Currently, all my bills and transactions are managed by their online-banking system. (Which is superb!) I completely trust Bank of America and even though I have had trouble a few of times, (ATM not giving me money, lost card, etc) Bank of America has been able to swiftly and effectively compensate and help. I strongly recommend Bank of America.","397":"For the most part I have enjoyed banking with Bank of America because I can usually always find one near where I am when I am traveling. I became one of their customers when I got married and was added to my husband's account on our honeymoon. It was pretty straightforward getting added to his account. However, after my name was changed it was not so easy getting my name changed on the account. We ended up having to go to the bank twice to get my name changed because they required additional information I did not have at the time.On other occasions we have had to make multiple trips to the bank to get things done because of different rules. Sometimes, the lines are fairly long but at other times there is no wait time. I have had to wait the most when I need to actually see someone other than a bank teller. For the most part, the experience has been okay.","396":"I've had more than a few Bank of America accounts. In fact my very first bank account was made with Bank of America thanks to an accumulation of a birthday money right around my fifth birthday. With a handful of checks I entered the bank with my mother as guardian and waited in line for a few minutes before being ushered to an uncomfortable chair where I squirmed partly in patience partly in excitement as I answered the questions of the administer. The process I remember took too long. The bank worker asked too many questions, mainly directed to my mother, and any supposed decision of my own was commandeered by her. That bank account I ended up having for about six years.It had no return on its investment. But the most positive thing about B of A was how easy it was to withdraw or deposit money, at that time. Unfortunately since then my local branch has not been quite so expedient, and even worse the interest rates on my accounts never amounted to diddly squat. And they send endless brochures of updated policies in fine print of how to squander their collateral and get it back by shifty policies. Join a credit union instead, or you are just giving more unearned holdings to the fat cats who gamble away your money rather than protect it.","1076":"Bank of America allows me to deposit cash at ATM machines of theirs that accept paper bills. This comes in handy when I know a check is going to bounce or any time I see my account going to a negative balance and I want to avoid receiving an overdraft fee. Of course any checking account can be kept from a negative balance if one simply maintains an accurate check register and never spends beyond the available balance shown on that register but sometimes when I am having a busy week that creates more spending on the run, my available balance seems to disappear faster than I can keep track.Any time I see my account running negative I must get to a Bank of America ATM and deposit cash before 8pm that evening. Once Bank of America clears the days transactions over night my balance must be running positive or I am going to receive at least one overdraft fee.Aside from their overdraft fees, recently I learned they have a check cashing fee for anyone who does not have an account with them. In other words if you are holding a check in your hand that is drawn on Bank of America, even if it is a payroll check, you will be charged $6 to cash that check at one of their teller windows. Since I already hold a Bank of America checking account I can cash a check written to me and drawn on them with no fee but for anyone who wants to get immediate cash for a check drawn on Bank of America and does not want to hold an account with them, they will be out the six dollars. If your employer keeps their payroll in a Bank of America account and you bank with someone else you might want to be on direct deposit if you are not already.","394":"I just wanted to take a few moments to write about my great experience with Bank of America. Their customer service is excellent. When I first stepped foot into the bank, I was warmly greeted by friendly staff who promptly assisted me with applying for a new checking account. I currently have an online account with Bank of America and using it has been a breeze. It's so easy to use and they keep you updated via email regarding any changes that have been made to your account. I am very please with them and will likely keep my account with them for the rest of my life. I also enjoy that fact that they are all over the country (contrary to other banks I've banked with).","1075":"I have been using Bank of America for a while now. There's always friendly service, clean banks, and speedy lines, at least the branch I go to does. I rarely go in mine and encounter a huge line. There are ATMs everywhere on my path back and forth to work. The downside is the fees. There's a fee for staring at the ATM too long, and a fee for passing one up. >_>They also have a bad habit of blocking my account when I'm using my card. This has happened at least 4 times with me, and more to my cousin and brother. They say its because of 'suspicious activity'. How is a $3.75 charge at Wal-Mart suspicous? When this happens, you can't access your account again until you call and talk to them. I am actually in the process of changing banks.","390":"My experience thus far with Bank of America has been a positive one. I opened an account with them after my longtime bank merged and decided to implement many fees. At BoA, I was able to open an account online; it was a fast, easy, hassle-free process and best yet the account is FREE! A few months after opening the account, I wanted to upgrade my account. I called them up to do so and the process took about 5mins. The representative was super nice and courteous, as they also are in person at my local branch. Since it\u2019s a larger bank with many branches, there are plenty of ATM locations too.","391":"My overall experience with Bank of America was horrible. I started a Student Savings account with them- they told me at the time of start up that it would be free. A month later I get a service fee of 9.99 for the account. When I went down to talk to them, they said the fee was because it was SUMMER! They told me the account was free so long as I was a student, and I was in high school at the time. They removed the fee only when I threatened to close the account and move to another bank, but they were hell to deal with every time I wanted to make a withdrawal from the account. When I got fed up and wanted to close the account, they tried to collect more fees and hold my money for 2 weeks, even though I hadn't violated any rules or contracts. I will never, EVER start another account with this bank!","393":"Bank of America has gone above and beyond for me time after time with my personal checking account. Unlike other, smaller banks that I've used, Bank of America has provided me with excellent customer service when I\u2019ve left the country and has never given me any grief about extraneous charges. I\u2019ve never had any security problems or even had to pay for my account with them, as it should be. I\u2019ve never been turned down when trying to use my card after 2 years of having it and the features they provide, like overdraft protection and online banking, have never failed me. I enjoy banking with them and I can\u2019t see myself anywhere else.","687":"I have had this card for about two years. Overall, I have been very pleased with the card. When I first opened the card, I was not charged interest for a set time period (I don't remember the specifics now). Now, I am charged a little under 17% on my balance. I also enjoy the rewards that are available through my accrued points. There are lots of great rewards, but I have consistently redeemed my points for cash. I am able to redeem points often, since points accrue on almost all of my purchases. I also bank with BOA, which makes it simple to pay on my credit card and transfer between my accounts.","686":"Bank of America\u2019s Privilege with Travel Rewards Credit Card is a great credit card to have. I travel a lot for both work and personal reasons. I have accumulated points\/rewards and it has paid off!Furthermore, their customer service is excellent. My credit card was stolen from my home, along with my laptop and iPad, both of which contained sensitive and personal information that include my credit card information. The reacted very in a very timely fashion and were extremely helpful in providing excellent protection against fraud. Their representative was caring and very thorough. I was confident that no problems would arise and none did.","683":"I absolutely love this card to death. I use to have a different bank and the card I had would only work when it wanted to. It was completely annoying, and embarrassing because I was the girl trying to pay with a card that didn't work. If I could recommend any card to anyone it would be Bank of America. I have never had a problem using it, it has always worked for me. Not only is the card useful but the people that work for Bank America are awesome. The card has so many features like the bonuses you receive when you use the card. I am always get cash back when I use my card. What better way too earn cash. Everyone I know has some form of card card why not use a card that pays back.I have never been late on a payment as long as you spend in your budget and you make sure that you are only spending money that you can pay back then I would say get this credit card. They have a pretty large grace period so if you ever have troubles you have a quiet a while too pay it back. I have never had a problem it is one of the easiest cards that I have ever had to work with.","3525":"This Bank Sucks! After years of thinking they close the business day on Fridays at 6:00PM like most all banks, I was just informed that the close business at 4:00 PM every day. \u00a0BOA will do anything to get a late fee and if you call to get one knocked off, forget it. \u00a0Go to wells Fargo if you have one, much better service and Chase closes business at 6:00 PM every day.\u00a0","688":"I really have no problem with this card whatsoever. Because everything is easily consolidated with my Bank of America Checking and Savings account, I never have to worry about late or missed payments. Everything is easily debited from my checking account as a small monthly payment. This is my first and only credit card so far, so I've been quite pleased with the rewards I've seen so far.So far, I've redeemed a domestic round-trip flight and even gotten some cash back from it. One of the \"prizes\" I redeemed was an iPod for my little sister. The cash-back option is pretty cool because not only will they give you some cash at different point-levels, they'll also add in a small bonus for redeeming it through your Bank of America checking account.Besides that, I got locked into a fairly good rate (for my credit) and hope to build my rating up in the future.","684":"I first got this card about a year ago and have loved it ever since. I have used Bank of America for 5 years so wanted to get my first credit card with them. This card is mainly used for gas and other minor purchases to build my credit. I have had a great experience with this card, including the time it was stolen and the card was ran up. Bank of America handled the fraud and refunded my money. I was not charged extra and did not receive any penalties. They also offer better interest rates than the other credit cards I had looked into. I also liked that they offered a variety of designs for the card. Would def recommend this card to any student who was looking into getting a credit card and building up good credit.","685":"I have thoroughly enjoyed using this credit card. It is the first credit card I have ever had and it has been an easy transition to get used to. It was fast and simple to set up and I can earn up to 3% back on my everyday purchases. It is a very good credit card if you don't want to be charged unnecessary fees. The card also can be decorated in a number of cool ways.","689":"I used Bank of America for its checking account services shortly after I turned 18. The application process was simple, and setting up direct deposit was fairly easy. The customer service was always decent, although it seemed that the representatives would do just what was within the range of their job responsibilities, nothing more and nothing less. The main reason I canceled my account was because of their ridiculous fees. The bank account would not post transactions for days and then put them all through at one time. This often resulted in multiple overdraft fees due to the \"available balance,\" which I would view prior to making purchases \/ paying bills, would not include pending transactions. It seemed like Bank of America was out to get as much of my money as it could, and it was not apologetic when I was faced with a financial difficulty because of this. I am much happier now with Wells Fargo and although Bank of America may have cleaned up its act, my experience left a bad taste in my mouth, making me unlikely to return as a customer.","20":"Bank of America in my opinion is one of the best banks when you compare them with other big banks. Personally I find it convenient that there is a large network of branches and ATM machines. It is very easy to access your funds. I also like to take advantage of the free online money management software called Bank of America My Portfolio. Bill payments and checking are free and there is no minimum balance required. And since I like talking on the phone I can really appreciate the live phone support which is available 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. The only feature I am not comfortable with is the $2 fee for using an ATM that is not a part of the Bank of America network. Overall I personally give Bank of America a very high ranking because of the ease of using the services they provide.","2011":"I decided on refinancing with Bank of America, several years ago, due to their low interest rate at the time. The mortgage lender that I was assigned worked hard to make sure that all my needs were taken care of. He carefully reviewed my personal situation and chose a mortgage plan that would work best for my family. He even showed up to the title company, at closing, to make sure that everything went through smoothly.I have not needed to call customer service for anything. I just get my monthly statement, pay it, and move on. So far so good.","2010":"Overall, I have been using Bank of America for the last 10 years! I never have to wait in line for longer than 10 minutes, which is a huge change from the other banks that I had previously been a member of. The late fees get reversed if you have a valid reason, and the my access checking is free if you have direct deposit. I have no complaints, the ATMs are basically everywhere, and they are friendly in person and over the phone. Also their savings rates are very competitive with other banks. I wont have to worry about Bank of America failing and my money is FDIC insured. What else can anyone ask for?","29":"I HAD been a BofA customer for many years. The service was never anything to write home about, but it was serviceable enough. My main reason for sticking with them as long as I did is simply because they are so national. I mean, regardless of what city I found myself in (I travel a lot) there was always a BofA somewhere nearby.However, after numerous incidents where my account balance would inexplicably drop, I had had enough. The process to get an account closed is just horrendous. There is no easy way to do it. I've read online that your account is never actually closed. Be careful, make sure if you do close the account, that you cancel any and all automatic debits from your account. Otherwise you'll wake up one morning and find you owe them for all sorts of crazy overdraft fees.","23":"Bank of America is not a bank I would recommend. I have been a customer for over 10 years and overtime things have changed for the worst. Their number one focus is making money, which for a bank is expected, but they do it at the expense of their customers. I recently had to change my bank account to an online bank account in order to avoid the various fees they were charging. If I choose to enter the bank I will be charged a monthly fee of 8+ dollars. In order to avoid that fee I have to do my banking online and via ATM. Recently I attempted to deposit a check at a bank ATM- the ATM screen displayed a message saying that it could not accept checks at that time. To sum it up being a BoA customer is extremely frustrating. The only reason I have stuck with them is due to the fact that they are everywhere. I moved away from home and a lot of the banks they have in this state aren\u2019t available in my home state and vice versa. If you have a choice I would recommend you try a different bank.","24":"Quickest sign up for a bank I've had and I've really had no issues since. They allowed me to pick only the services I wanted without having to add any services I had no desire to use, and were very thorough to ensure I wouldn't cause myself additional fees. I got a very cool Red Sox themed debit card about two weeks after signing up.I don't know why more banks don't try to utilize their ATMs, I like seeing the receipt have the checks right on it in case I need proof of them when something goes wrong, which to this point nothing has. Even when I forgot my PIN on my card they had it reset within about 20 minutes of showing up at my local branch.","21":"When I needed to buy a reliable, fuel-efficient car to make the hour commute to night school, I naturally went to my bank to ask about a loan. I had found a very nice used car FSBO \u2013 a Honda Accord wagon, fully loaded, in excellent condition, with 96K miles. It really was a peach of a car! But I was a few thousand $$ short. I went to B of A and asked to see a loan officer. He was summoned and emerged from his office in the back. I was not invited into his office, nor was I offered a chair. We stood in the entrance to a hallway and he asked what I needed. I told him about the car, the amount of money I had for a down payment, and the amount of money I needed to borrow. He barely glanced at me as he said, \u201cWe don\u2019t make loans in such small amounts. I suggest you put the purchase on your credit card.\u201d Then he excused himself and walked away. ?!! I\u2019m 50 something and female. I had an excellent credit record (partly because I\u2019m not stupid enough to use my credit card to buy a car), a modest but steady income, and a substantial down payment. But he couldn\u2019t be bothered with such small potatoes, leaving me to wonder \u201cJust who is serving whom here?\u201d A short time later our nation witnessed the collapse of the financial sector and the phrase \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d entered our public consciousness. My experience taught me that B of A regarded itself as very big and important and regarded me, their long-time customer, as very small and unimportant. Maybe if the banks had followed my kind of money instead of riding the tail of the comet and getting badly burned, the economy would be in much better shape today!","22":"I had been a customer with BofA for a long time. I remember in the 90's when the bank representatives went to my school to get the students set up with their own bank accounts. That was almost two decades ago. When the economy was good, I was one of their best customers. Despite the fact that I wasn't rich, I paid my balance on time, and I kept using their savings and checking account as well. Then came the downturn of the economy. I decided that going to a credit union would be better for me. I kept my credit card with the bank though. When I got married, I decided to change my name. The credit department decided to run a check on me and decided that I was no longer good enough to be their customer. They subsequently closed my account. I guess that they don't see me as a customer, just a number. Despite my diligence, my account was ultimately terminated.","2013":"Bank of America has always been professional and dispensed sound financial advice with my best interest in mind. Customer service has been beyond exceptional. Friendly, warm, and helpful-- they always are willing and able to help. I have a good rapport with the staff at my local branch of but I suspect that all locations are held to high standards and are similar in terms of satisfying customers needs. if you want to feel that your money is well handled you can rest easy knowing Bank of America only offers the highest caliber of care. Definitely recomended!","28":"The customer service at my branch of Bank of America was OK. They did a good job explaining everything that comes with your credit card and\/or bank accounts. The fees that they charge are rather high. When you call customer service, it is mostly automated so it is really hard to get a real person on the phone. When you do get someone on the phone, they person is most likely Indian, so it is hard to understand them and sometimes it takes a long time to get the service you want. For a big bank, I don't recommend using their services and I would not go back to them for any services I need. I find that your local community credit union offers better services, rates, and they feel like they want to get to know you at a personal level.","27":"Bank of America is a wonderful bank with exceptional customer service. My house was broken into and my credit cards, debit cards, laptop (with personal and banking info) on it and many other things were stolen. I worked with a wonderful customer service representative who helped ensure the safety of my accounts. They put me on additional fraud alert for the following six months as a safety precaution.Additionally, their rates and fees are competitively low. I have never had an issue with them. They are fair and justified.My banking experience with Bank of America has been nothing but easy and convenient. I will be a customer for a long time.","26":"I LOVED BOA when I had it. It was the best bank I have ever had and I went through quite a few until I came across this one. I loved how you could deposit checks into the ATM after bank hours, they started doing that years before any other bank did. They also make it easier to use the banks, no deposit slips to fill out, all you need is your bank card. They make things easier and more convenient.","25":"I was once a customer of Bank of America. Everything was fine with them while I had my job. I was only 15 years old and had a savings and a checking and my own debit card. Things were great.However one day I charged my debit card without funds in the bank 4 times in one day. I had cash but I miscalculated my funds in the bank and thought I had enough money. [in total the purchases combined cost was about 3 dollars.]The following day I go to my bank, turns out they slammed me with $212 overdraft fees. This is completely ridiculous and I will never ever again use this horrible excuse of a bank. I had enough money in my savings to cover the fees, so I balanced out the $212 dollar charge, and left that bank for good.This event scarred me and I have not had a bank since. I'm 22 years old now and deal in cash only. I cash my checks at Walmart where they charge 3 dollars. I'd much rather lose 3 dollars to cash a check than $212 dollars to greedy scumbags with no remorse for someones small mistake.I hate this company and wish nothing but the worst for all future endeavors of these soulless, remorseless monsters.","2012":"I recently opened a Bank of America account because of the low cost accounts that they offer. I did some research online before doing so and found that everything listed on the website was 100% truthful. There were no surprises or hidden fees. Whenever I go in for banking, I found that the tellers were all very helpful and accommodating. They offer a variety of different accounts so regardless of what you are looking for, you will find an account that will suit and fulfill all of your banking needs. Additionally, they give you access to 24 hour ATM and services geared to help you save such as the Keep the Change program.","2016":"Bank of America offers a variety of choices when it comes to banking. I personally have both the checking and saving account at Bank of America. Convenience was a big factor when it comes to banking. Bank of America offers an up to date online banking system where you can access your bank account and perform transactions any time at your convenience. The staff working at my local Bank of America were very resourceful when it comes to dealing with customers. ATMs are widely available in my area. The accessibility, convenience and comfortable banking system makes Bank of America one of the best banks in the United States.","2014":"My husband and I have been customers of Bank of America since we moved to North Carolina six years ago. We joined the bank just prior to our physical move and do most of our banking online and when we do need to use the branch, we go to the one on 73 near Northcross. With all the negative press that Bank of America has received in the past few years, we have maintained our loyalty and for good reason. We have our checking account, savings account and our main credit card with BofA.Recently we planned a trip to Ireland and received an unexpected call from the Bank just a week before our departure. The customer representative informed us that someone attempted to use our card in Minnesota (we are in North Carolina) by charging $9.65. This immediately alerted the credit card \"watchers\" who contacted us right away. We were told that this is the way these crooks \"try out\" a card to see if anyone is watching. If nothing happens, the crook then maxes out the credit line before the card is closed. BofA closed our account immediately and then over nighted new cards to us in time for our departure to Ireland. This was outstanding monitoring and service on the part of BofA and we are grateful for this!I love the online services and utilize them every single day from home. We have also been very impressed with the service we receive at the actual bank locations (we have used the one on 73 for the most part, but have also utilized uptown and other branches when necessary). Actually, we have never had a negative experience with this bank and will continue to use BofA in the foreseeable future.","233":"My husband and I have held this Visa card, originally issued by MBNA, for the last 20+ years. Bank of America was one of small handful of creditors who were very willing to work with us when we experienced great financial difficulty. We did not want to lose the card or the very large credit limit we had established on it, but due to unforeseen circumstances, we came to a point in our lives where we were simply not able to keep up with everything, including our monthly payments on the card.When we dove into doing everything we could to pay our debts, repair our credit and avoid bankruptcy at all costs, I called Bank of America and was transferred to a debt specialist who worked with me on the phone for over an hour coming up with a doable plan to reduce our payment and stop further interest from accruing. As long as we kept up with our end of things, there would be no further penalty and once our debt was paid off, Bank of America would issue us new cards. While they never technically closed our account so it wouldn't appear as a card-issuer closure on our credit report, they did ask that we send them our current cards and would not authorize any purchases to be make on the account.Our debt specialist was wonderful and checked in on us every quarter for the next few years as we diligently made our payments. I felt as if the specialist were truly concerned and once we finished making our payments, we received our agreement, marked paid in full, from Bank of America. They also worked very quickly to issue new cards and restored our credit line in full.I was surprised to receive such service from such a large company and never once was made to feel like a terrible human being for having financial difficulties.","239":"I've had a checking account with Bank of America for about four years now and I've had only a few minor problems that were resolved quickly. The staff is friendly and competent. One negative, however, about their checking account is their monthly fee is kind of high so that is a little disappointing. Another is you have to keep a minimum balance otherwise they will close your account. A couple minor problems, I've had with them in the past is the speed in which they process online and ACH payments which is kind of slow compared to some banks. For Bank of America, it was taking 5-7 business days, but other banks it has been only 1-3 days at the most. I've also had some pretty nasty overdraft fees that were charged before some of my deposits were processed. Overall, I give Bank of America 3 out of 5 stars.","2017":"I have been a member of this institution for roughly 2 months now, after switching from a bank I've belong to for 16 years. So far, I have access close to me, since they have 7 branches within reasonable driving distance. The tellers and loan officers seem to be always friendly whenever I visit, and I've never had an issue with wait times or lines. They all seem to take my banking needs seriously, doesn't matter if it's my checking account or I'm asking for help about car loans, personal loans, or home equity questions. I am also extremely pleased with their customer support available by phone and online. Their system is easy to use and once you reach an operator, they are always helpful and direct you to the right place. This bank has a decent smart phone application that you can use for your online banking needs, something my previous bank was falling behind on. You can access everything through the application on any handheld device.","238":"I used Bank of America for my small business checking account, and was very happy with their service and fee structure. I rarely had an issue with my account, and when I did it was always cleared up quickly. They were able to handle all of my credit card transactions, and I never felt as if I were getting screwed by the bank. That's a rarity these days in banking. Best of all, they had branches near both my business AND my home, so no matter where I was or where I was going, it was always easy to stop in and make a deposit. I would recommend a BoA account for anybody who's looking for a small business account with a great bank.","237":"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a BOA checking account since I was sixteen and haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really had any major problems with them. I originally signed up with them because they were doing an off-site event at my work and decided that I needed to get an actual bank account so I would have somewhere to actually put my paychecks. I love that my account (MyAccess Checking) is free with direct deposit so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to worry about any monthly fees and that every time I have had any kind of problems or questions the people that work there seem to be eager to fix or answer them for me without making me feel dumb about it. Overall, I think BOA is a decent bank, not sure if it is the best out there, but they definitely seem to take care of their customers.","2018":"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had a checking account at Bank of America for about three years. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never had any issues with them. I have had to call customer service on a couple occasions to sort out some minor issues, and the service I received was competent and friendly. I use this bank on a daily basis to make purchases and I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had so much as a small issue with them. I have made thousands of purchases in this time. What I enjoy the most is the online banking available at their website. I can keep track of all of my account info and activity in one easy aggregate. It works well. I recommend the services.","236":"I opened my checking and savings account at Bank of America in high school. I don't want to date my age too much, but that was over a decade ago! Overall, they've given me great customer service with a few hiccups. I've had instances where my checks took longer than I'd like to clear, and similar speed issues with online payments. I've been lucky to have only one over draft, which was reversed when I provided online documentation of when my purchase was made, and when the over draft occurred. That's what I most appreciate about BoA - the tellers are always open to your side, never brusque and will bring a supervisor to you to resolve the problem, instead of leaving you standing at the window wondering what they're talking about in the back room!","235":"I had always been a big fan of Bank of America as I hate paying fees for ATMs, checking accounts, etc. Back when I opened the account in late 2005, I was able to get all of this without even asking. What has happened lately though is, as I have moved on in my life and have noticed that while my personal banking remains relatively straight-forward and fee free, my business accounts are riddled with fees and charges from everything from making change to making large cash deposits. As a result I am considering changing banks to a local credit union for both my personal and business accounts.. I will say though that the staff at all branches I have ever worked with have been really great.","234":"I have been a customer of Bank of America for almost a decade. I started with a student account. I actually opened my account with Fleet just prior to Bank of America's acquisition, and my account was seamlessly transitioned into BoA later that year. The student checking was wonderful, and I never had any problems with it. The fees were light (I actually can't remember any fees at all!) and the debit card was very convenient.However, all good things must come to an end. I have since transitioned into a grown-up account (they call it something more professional, of course) and that comes with a few new fees. The one that really bugs me is the \"account maintenance fee\" of $12 per month which they only charge if your balance falls below $1500. Times are tight, so it sucks that I have to keep that much extra in my checking account just to avoid their massive fee which would otherwise add up to $144 per year!But other than that fee, the bank has been great. They customer service phones are EXCELLENT. My wife is with Wachovia (er... I guess they are \"Wells Fargo\" now, since the buyout) and I cannot believe how badly that company treats her. Bank of America has never been anything but pleasant to me - I wouldn't dream of leaving them.","2015":"I have been a customer with Bank of America for a good while now, ever since it merged with MBNA a few years ago. On the whole, BoA is fairly typical of banks of its size: there's going to be a lot of fees and a lot of red tape to get things accomplished such as a car loan or home loan. If you have decent credit, they do have good low-interest checking options, but there are always stipulations and restrictions. Because of its size, it somewhat reliable, and have helped me get my problems fixed quickly without a lot of hassle. Overall, BoA is good, not great.","230":"I chose the simple e-banking option without a monthly fee. I'm a student and this makes the most sense, since I don't have a huge income. My account has certain limitations, that makes it a pain to bank with Bank of America. I can not use a teller and I must use the ATM or online banking to do all of my banking. The person signing me up even said that Bank of America has a fee for everything (that should have been a red flag). After about six months I start getting a five dollar fee every month. I called them and was of course put on hold for about thirty minutes before I talk to somebody about it. Apparently the notice that they were changing their terms and services was mailed to the wrong address. In the end they did waive the fee and resolve the problem after a couple teeth being pulled. They have some dishonest business practices that make me never want to bank with them again. Maybe they should realize I am the one giving them the capital for next to nothing interest and they should respect me as a customer more.","231":"Overall, my experience with Bank of America has been mediocre. I have a checking account with Bank of America and haven't encountered any issues in regard to financial transactions. Every time I walk into one of their locations, I feel like there's too much emphasis placed on recruiting new members instead of servicing existing members. The lines are long and the locations I've visited seem under staffed. I definitely wouldn't feel comfortable taking out a loan from Bank of America because I don't think this bank offers the best deals for its customers. Don't have any particular loyalty to this bank because I don't think it offers anything unique.","232":"When I first started looking for a bank, I was apprehensive about Bank of America. You hear so many bad things about them, that it would scare anyone away. After looking at all my options, I ended up at Bank of America. I was stunned when I found out I could open up an account without any monthly fees at all. As the months went by, I had absolutely no problems with Bank of America. Then when I had my debit card information stolen, I learned how kind and compassionate the people who work customer service are. I was worried it would be someone who didn't understand English, but it turned out to be someone local and we even made small talk.I would not give up Bank of America for any other bank. It's been wonderful to me.","2019":"Bank of America was my first bank and a learning experience. To be honest, Bank of America was not my first choice. The day I joined I was only there to cash a check given to me as a graduation gift. The clerk pressured me into joining and to keep up the pressure had a banker confront me. I just wanted to cash my check with no conflict so I joined. After joining I had to wait a week for them to process my registration that would come with a debit card in the mail. I had no general problems using the service but I wasn't a man with a job so after a couple of months of not putting money into my account, they closed it without ever contacting me or telling me about the closure. I would find out when I tried to log on one day and then calling their customer service did I find out that I was no longer an account holder. Considering all the trouble Bank of America is right now and of hearing of high over draft fees from other customers I got real lucky. Bank of America being a for profit bank is not for me because I have no desire to get a fee for every single penny of my money that I want to use.","1780":"I\u2019ve had the Bank of America Student credit card for about a year now and I love it. I use this card for small purchases specifically to build my credit up. It is very useful when I\u2019m in an emergency situation and need a little extra cash. I once lost my credit card and called Bank of America\u2019s customer service to report it stolen and they were so helpful and nice. They canceled my lost credit card account and sent me a new card really fast. I make my monthly payment online which is really convenient! You can also view your statement online which includes your credit limit, interest rate, charges and balance. I definitely would recommend this credit card!","1781":"I just activated my new Bank of America Rewards card. In the past year I have been repaying debt and now that all my other credit cards are repaid I wanted to have one card to use on a monthly basis for all purchases. Between groceries, gas, clothing and the occasional dinner, I am looking at spending at least $1,000 each month and with 3% on gas, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else, it will add up quickly. Also, when I was applying for the card, I didn't realize that there is additional $100 cash back for the first $500 spent on the card. The customer service representative let me know about that feature when I was activating my card over the phone. Sweet! I have been a Bank of America customer for 15 years now and in the past had a Bank of America credit card which did not have similar perks. I am really excited to start getting some money back on my monthly purchases.","1782":"I applied for this card recently because of the $100 cash back bonus offer. To be honest, all I wanted was the reward for opening the account so I didn't plan on using the card much at all. I changed my mind after using it to make the $100 in purchases required to qualify for the bonus offer. I found their cash back reward program to be pretty good (even better than my Discover which I've had for years). After getting into the swing of things, I found myself racking up bonus points pretty quickly. I now use this card for most purchases (and even paying household bills). What I really like about their program is that I am guaranteed to get at least 1% even if it's not within the parameters of the current bonus their running. I don't have to worry about losing my points either because they never expire (great for when I'm not sure what I want to use it on, I can hold off until something really good comes up). I got 0% interest (introductory offer, of course) on the first year. Too competitive not to take advantage of.","1783":"The Student Platinum Visa credit card from Bank of America is a great first credit card for students looking to build credit. I applied for this card with my mother as a co-signer when I first went to college and was approved for $2000 because of her credit history. I have since been approved for an increased limit and have been able to remove my mother from the account. With this card alone I have built a responsible credit history. The online banking system is very easy to use and I pay my monthly bills within minutes of signing on. I also really appreciate the high level of security for my online account. I have found that this is seriously lacking in some other banks. There were many card design choices so everyone can find one that suits their liking. I was able to select one with a Florida State University design that truly fits my style. Like any credit card, if you pay off the entire balance on time you will not incur any interest.There is no annual fee or minimum balance. You do not get any reward points or cash back bonuses, but overall it is a great credit card for students and people just starting out towards financial independence. I would recommend the Student Platinum Visa credit card to anyone in my age-range (18-25) looking to build credit.","1786":"I had a problem with my BankAmericard Cash Rewards card late last year which has caused me to discontinue using the card. I purchased some shoes online, and was shocked to find they shipped from China. The shoes that arrived were a different style and size than the ones I ordered. The online company was giving me the runaround about a refund, so I was sure BankAmericard would back me up. No such luck. They told me I had to pay to ship the incorrect shoes back to China to get a refund. When the company wouldn't give me a return shipping address, I sent all the info to BankAmericard, but they did NOTHING about it. Out $70, no help.","1787":"My experience with this Bank of America Visa card has been hit and miss. While I appreciate all of the extra protection they offer via Privacy Assist and so forth, they really do try and sell you all of the coverages even if they are duplicated. During the holidays my payment was due Jan 2nd and with all of the goings on I made my payment on Jan 3rd. Well this card has no grace period on late payments and for the past couple of years now I have had an obnoxious APR that they won't reduce despite all of my on-time payments and balance reductions. While I appreciate the credit limit and fraud protection this is not my go-to card now. It's a shame because I would love to use it more and I really do have great credit.","1788":"The AAA Rewards MasterCard is widely accepted by most retailers and I have been able to use it easily online as well. The fact that there is no annual fee is important to me and I\u2019m never late with payments so I don\u2019t care too much about the late fees. The points that I collect are pretty cool because things like groceries, gas, the mall, and online shopping are all things that I do on a regular basis. Of course the biggest specific advantage for me is that I have AAA auto insurance and there are a couple of benefits that this gives with regards to travel and retail purchases from AAA. On the whole, I am pleased with this card as it offers decent rewards, especially some targeted towards my memberships and it\u2019s widely accepted.","1785":"I think this card is an average value. I'm a huge golf fan so having the famous Island Green of TPC Sawgrass's Stadium Course is pretty cool. I know that other cards may have better rewards systems, but the World Points system offered by Bank of America offers a variety of awards, from cash in the form of a check, to gift cards, merchandise, travel, and also certain experiences. I admit that the \"experiences\" offered by the company do not have much relevance to the gofer. I was hoping there would be possible tickets to PGA events, but there doesn't seem to be much of that available. If it is offered, it is certainly cheaper to just buy the tickets on your own.I do like the World Points mall, which offers additional points for shopping on several sites using the link off of Bank of America's site. The catch is you must go to the link off of the World Points site rather than just going to sites like 1800-Flowers or Day's Inn on your own.Bank of America has generously extended my credit line to $5,000. I do not carry a balance, so I cannot comment on the interest rate. There is no annual fee, which is important to me.","1784":"I use this card almost exclusively for gas purchases. It is so much more convenient to swipe it at the pump, rather than go inside the gas store. I get 3% back on gas purchases, which really helps take some of the bite out of high prices of gas. Once in awhile I use it for other purchases like groceries, but I try to stick to cash on that. If I do use it for groceries (2% cash back), or gas too actually, I try to pay it off as soon as I can because if I end up paying a lot of interest it negates the benefit of getting cash back.","1450":"I would have to go with just OK for Bank of America since I am reviewing their checking. If I was reviewing their mortgage process it would be negative stars but I'm not. Their checking was easy to use online and I liked having access to the Visa check card. It was free so long as you used direct deposit. Having said that, if you are a teacher, like me and don't get paid over the summer expect to be charged the two months you are not getting the deposits. You can call, explain and they fix it but it will happen every summer because no one at Bank of America communicates with any other department and they don't pay attention to your information unless you OWE them money. I finally left because they were planning to charge for use of the check card, which they took back. They will find some other way to get the fee in. Not bad, but not good either.","914":"Overall I have had a fairly good experience with Bank of America. The people I deal with at the bank are always friendly and willing to help me. The only problem I have run into is that the lines are often very long at my local branch and I end up waiting 10-15 minutes in line nearly every time I go to the bank. Other bank employees even come up to ask what I need, yet don't open another window to help me. I don't pay any account fees, which is nice. I do not get free ATM access at non-bank ATMs though. Bank of America's online system is great. I can pay all my bills right online and from a single website. The online system is one of the main reasons I am still with Bank of America. I am glad they never decided to start charging $5.00 a month to use my debit card, otherwise I would no longer be a bank customer.","1457":"I've never had much trouble with Bank of America and do most of my banking through the ATM so there is not too much chance to run into bad customer support or anything. I know a lot of people complain about large banks because of various reasons, but I really like the convenience of having a bank on every corner. I always know that my banking can be done at any time of day and any day of the week thanks to their innovative all-purpose ATMs. The only real set back I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve encountered is that you have to pay more to be able to do banking inside. While I hardly ever need to go inside, I would like the ability to at least ask a question without thinking I am going to get charged.","1458":"The survival of this bank in the next 50 years is all but guaranteed, almost nothing else is. If you want customer service, you'll face an abrasive and often rude, highly mechanical process. IM chat feedback on their website was nice, but I have never had a pleasant experience in the actual bank.Bank of America also has made and redacted some notoriously bad decisions in the last few years, including a dead-before-it-began announced $5 fee on debit transactions. That's when I closed my account. It's only a matter of time before current management comes out with some other shenanigans.","1459":"I have been very pleased with Bank of America. I like that there are always ATMs available, no matter where you are in the country. I also enjoy the deposit feature with the machines, which means that you are not confined to the schedule of the bank, but can do your banking at your own leisure. It's really nice that the ATMs take checks too.Bank of America also makes banking easy online. It is simple to find out your balance, make a transfer, or pay your bills. On top of that, the online system eliminates a large amount of paper and unnecessary postage. I am very glad that I bank with Bank of America.","1789":"Overall, I've been satisfied with Bank of America. I've been banking with BofA since I was a kid. I've banked with other banks such as Citi Bank and US Bank and one thing I like about BofA is I never get sent to a customer service representative who doesn't speak clear English. In the passed I've had issues with deposits not being posted in a timely manner and overdraft fees which were applied ahead of any deposits. Since BofA has changed their policies, I've been very pleased with them. I currently hold three checking accounts with BofA and an investment account. I'm pleased with their willingness to listen to consumers and not begin charging debit card fees. Overall I would give BofA four stars.","2130":"I have had nothing but problems when it comes to Bank of America. They have disabled my account numerous times because I bought too many things from different establishments. It was then such a pain to get my account reactivated. I am a fan of how easy it is to use their ATM machine. Depositing checks, etc... If it wasn't for how strict they were when it comes to transactions I would have given them five stars. I have a great financial history yet I still encounter problems with them almost monthly. I've also found that they have been getting very strict with third party checks. If my father has a check and signs it over to me they won't accept it. I'm sorry but I have to give Bank of America three out of five stars!","910":"I have had an account with Bank of America for a long time and I've always had pretty good customer service. The employees at the bank always greet me when I come in and are always very courteous. Some of their fees are pretty high but it's worth it to have a bank has branches all across America. I don't like the fact that they took a government bailout but I think they paid back all the money. One time I had a charge on my card that I didn't recognize and the bank was very efficient at getting me my money back. Even though it's a large national bank the branch here in my town makes me feel like it's a local bank. Overall I would recommend this bank to my friends and associates","911":"I really love banking with Bank of America. I have been a customer for many years now and I plan to continue being a customer for many more years to come. My family and friends all bank with Bank of America. The drive through bank tellers are wonderful and always nice and helpful to me. Sometimes I go inside to handle my transactions and everyone is so nice and helpful inside as well. Even when I go online or over the phone transactions I'm always pleased. Compared to other banks, I believe that Bank of America's fees are about the same if not less.","912":"The first bank I had was APGFCU which is a personal credit union. However, this bank was only located in one state, so when I moved, I needed to find a new bank. My friend convinced me to go with Bank of America because she is with them, and she said it is a really good bank. To be honest, what convinced me was her hello kitty bank card. She told me Bank of America had a lot of great designs for cards. I was all about having cute stuff back then. When I went to sign up, the man who took care of me was great and very informative. Now I have the online checking and keep the change savings accounts. I go paperless, so I get my statements emailed to me and handle all my transactions online and through ATM's only. By doing this, I do not have to pay the monthly fees, which is why I absolutely love this bank. They have a lot of different options as to what kind of accounts you can set up and they have so many different methods that help you avoid the monthly fees. I probably won't change banks ever.","1451":"Bank of America, in my opinion, is an excellent bank. They have a friendly staff, and many different types of accounts to choose from. I had a bad experience with a bank a couple of years ago, and Bank of America made me feel comfortable and earned my trust. They worked with me to get me an account that I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to pay for and is easy to use. Their drive thru service has plenty of lanes and they are quick to help each and every person whether you walk in or drive up. They also have two ATMs, one of them is a drive up ATM and the other is a walk up ATM, which are convenient.","913":"I hear a lot of poor opinions of Bank of America from other people I talk to but I have had nothing but positive experiences. My account had been compromised and they refunded all of the money that was taken fraudulently within minutes, before the paperwork was even done, and set me up with a new account to prevent further issues. They got me tons of information to help the police track the criminals who did it. One other time Netflix took my monthly fee out earlier than usual which resulted in some overdraft fees, but a call to the customer service was all it took to get it worked out. A great supervisor named Teresa took care of the fees for me even when technically they didn't have to. I have had a lot of bad experiences with banks I am amazed at how well we have been treated by this bank.","915":"I have recently opened up an account at Bank of America, since my account is linked to my parents, and they recently switched banks from Wells Fargo to Bank of America. Overall, I would have to say I am very pleased so far. But, although the interest rates are better than Wells Fargo at .40% APY for 12 month CD's and IRA's, the rates are also only about half the rate of my other bank account with ING. Although, they make up for it with great customer service, and also the simplicity. They have great website as well as a great app, making transferring money from within your account or to another account a breeze. They also have over 17,000 ATM's throughout the United States, and their headquarters is in Charlotte, which is very convenient for me as I live in South Carolina and their ATM's are literally everywhere. Overall, a very solid bank.","1456":"Absolutely love this bank. Bank of America has never let me down and I have been with them for 2 years. Their customer service is the best I have ever dealt with. Anytime I needed them they were right there ready to assist me. I once lost my debit card and they happily canceled the card for me and replaced it for free. The application process is amazingly simple and they walk you through the whole process. If you are looking for a new bank or your first bank, Bank of America is the bank to go with. They are hands down the best bank around!","916":"Overall, my experience at Bank of America has been positive. I have accounts in multiple banks but BoA is currently my bank of choice. ATMs are widely available in many cities and my hometown, and I've had no security problems. One thing to be aware of is that they do charge a maintenance fee on savings accounts with under $300 deposited, which is not always made clear immediately. Depending on your account there may be extra charges for using a teller. Paperless statements are also a highly preferred option at BoA. Customer service is variable; the representative may come from a foreign call center, which can make communication more difficult, but they have all been polite thus far.","917":"I have been using Bank of America Checking account for 12 years and my overall experience with it is excellent. I opened the account in California, and I stayed there for 9 years, then I moved to Florida and I continued using the account. Several things I like BOA checking account include:(1) BOA has ATMs in many places around the country, so I don't need to cancel my bank account and open a new one when I move from one state to another. The best thing is that even in China, on the ATMs of China Construction Bank, I can withdraw Chinese RMB cash with my BOA checking card, without transaction fee!(2) BOA online service is excellent. It keeps records of the images of every check I wrote, so I can check the content of those checks for which I forgot who and why I wrote to.(3) BOA online service allows me transfer money instantly to and from other BOA users, without transaction fee.","918":"I have been using this bank for about five years now and have had nothing but excellent service! The tellers are all friendly and super helpful when needed. I also like the convenience of the outdoor, drive up ATMS in which you can make deposits and withdrawls. The account I have set up (checking and savings) was completely free and easy to use at all times. I would highly recommend this bank to anyone!","919":"I have been a customer of Bank of America for over 10 years. I currently have a MyAccess checking Account, and have never run into any issues with having my checks cleared, the transferring of funds to other banks\/agents, or having money directly withdrawn. One time, I deposited money into an ATM and money came out the next day, yet for some reason the deposit did not clear yet and the result was that I was charged with an overdraft fee. I ended up going into Bank of America location, and the agent was friendly and understanding. She reversed the fee for me. I never had any other issues after that one.","1454":"I got a Bank of America checking account a couple of years ago. I was tired of all of the extra fees and charges that local banks were adding onto my account. I researched and choose Bank of America. The application process was very easy and I was able to get my debit\/ATM card and checks mailed to me quickly. Since there were no branches in my area, I was somewhat hesitant as to how I would be able to control my money. I spoke with customer service and was informed that I could easily make deposits and withdrawals from any Bank of America ATM (there are several in my area at various locations and even in the mall). This was a great convenience, even though I was somewhat disappointed that there was no other way. Overall I like the banking and I do most of it online. It\u2019s convenient and easy.","1453":"My experience with Bank of America was less than favorable. I had no problem with them for years, but when an issue arose, it was clear that they were not reasonable and did not care about keeping a customer. I had a company charge my card that was linked to my checking account daily for an unauthorized charge. This occurred for two weeks, while I was on vacation. I was not contacted in any manner to alert me to a problem. I found out when I went to pay a bill after my pay was automatically deposited. It turned out I was charged hundreds of dollars for one repetitive charge, that was not valid. I could not find anyone that would acknowledge that the charge was unauthorized, or that would be willing to remove more than one overdraft charge. Needless to say, I have since changed banks.","1452":"I go into my Bank of America branch about once a month. Every single time I walk in, I get greeted at the door. The people at the front counter always greet me with a smile and are very polite. As I leave, I am always acknowledged! \"Have a good day, ma'am.\" I love the service I get at my branch!!","1455":"I've had a Bank of America MyAccess checking account for a little over a year now. My account was a breeze to set up online, I'm able to pay my bills online directly through the bank website and I do all my banking online. Was able to use one of their ATMs, as well as the ATM of another bank with no trouble. They offer personalized checks and a number of great deals on their website. I am able to check my balance and transactions via text banking, and I also have a savings account that has been a breeze to set up also, and has allowed my money to grow.","2131":"When choosing a bank to meet my needs, I knew I wanted a company who understood their customers. I chose to open a checking account at Bank of America over 7 years ago. Bank of America has had some hiccups through these rough economic times, but they are just that, hiccups. This company has proven to be a top competitor in the banking industry and willing to meet the needs of their customers.I found that having a checking account with Bank of America, not only ensures great customer service, but many perks I get to take advantage of. Keep the Change and Add It Up are two of the extras that checking account holders get to enjoy. When paying for a transaction, the amount is rolled up to the nearest dollar and the change is placed into a savings account. You have access to the money at all times and this is a great way to help you save money using the Keep the Change program. The Add It Up program is a great way to earn cash back. When you make a purchase online using your checking account, you can earn cash back at certain online stores.Overall, I have been extremely happy carrying my checking account with Bank of America. They have so many extras to offer account holders making them a great choice to bank with. There are numerous branch locations across the United States with even more atms scattered throughout the country. Regardless of the type of checking account one may be looking for, Bank of America has many options for everyone.","2132":"Bank of America is definitely my choice overall. I have had a checking account with Bank of America for over four years. I have had absolutely no problems. They do not charge me for having a low balance, I am able to get cashier\u2019s checks for free, and I can transfer money between other Bank of America accounts for free. Their customer service alone tops all other banks, and is one of the main reasons I choose to bank with them. I have been banking with B of A for years now and I do not plan to change that any time soon! I'd have to say they rank as Excellent in my books. I could not imagine choosing another bank!","3526":"Bank Of America Redefines Zero As A Negative Number I have many reasons to dislike Bank of America (will be closing all accounts tomorrow), but I just had to pass on the zero as a negative number story.\u00a0 We had business accounts with Bank of America, and, after we shut down, I had to continue to keep the Payroll account open to finish up taxes, etc.\u00a0 I forgot to put the money into the payroll account for the payroll service's ACH transfer\u00a0to pay themselves, resulting in an overdraft.\u00a0 My mistake, which I discovered the next day, and made the transfer to cover the overdraft and the $35 overdraft fee.\u00a0 Should be story over, right?\u00a0 A day or two later I discovered that they had charged another $35, then another fee (something about consecutive days overdrawn).\u00a0 I call BoA and try to explain that I returned the balance on the account to ZERO the day after the overdraft, so there should only have been ONE overdraft fee, and nothing else.\u00a0 I go round and round with the customer service, who passes me on to a manager (after I start yelling in frustration).\u00a0 The manager sees my point, but explains that their system does not recognize returning an account to zero as remedying the overdraft.\u00a0 If I had put one additional penny into the account none of this would have happened.\u00a0 The manager had to go to HER MANAGER for permission to remove the additional fees!\u00a0 I thought it was basic grade school math, but evidently not for Bank of America.\u00a0 Zero is a negative number for Bank of America!","2139":"I am a former LPI Specialist from the bank's mortgage\/insurance tracking. These banksters are complete scam artists. Check your RSS feed for news about \"Force Placed Insurance\" and you'll see what I mean.Also, please check out my whistleblower blogs detailing snippets of exactly how Bank of America and Countrywide knowingly hid banking information, and what I had to go through to get the information out to the proper people, such as the SEC, 50 State Attorneys General, and the New York Department of Financial Services. Google \"Brian Penny Bank of America\" to learn more about how millions of car and homeowners have been getting ripped off for decades for literally trillions of dollars by the financial industries.","1850":"I have been with B of A for nearly three years. During that time they have greatly improved their customer service, at least with regard to checking accounts.They now allow you to deposit a check into an ATM and they will allow up to $200 to be available immediately, and the full amount of the check will be available after 8.00 p.m. that same day.They used to hold all but $100 for up to two or three days in the past - most frustrating.They have also improved (or reduced) the alacrity with which they would apply charges, if it looked like you were going to go overdrawn.I have had deposits made but pending and payments due to be made (also showing as pending) but instead of processing the deposits and then making the payments, they actually processed the smaller deposits, made the payments and then charged me for going overdrawn!I was able to get them to remove those charges, but the fact that they put them on in the first place and having to make a call to rectify the situation was annoying to say the least.I'd really like it if they'd put more ATMs in rural areas. We're left with just the local 2 or 3 branch banks, which charge extortionate amounts to use their ATMs, oh well. One more for the suggestion box.Overall though, I'm happy with B of A. I wonder what they did to deserve a D rating.","1859":"I've had my Bank of America checking and savings account for a couple years now and I'm very satisfied. Every time I have tried to contact them, they tried really hard to fix my problems or help me deleting some fees..I opened an account after chase took over Washington mutual (which i loved) and destroyed it.Bank of America has many ATMs where I live that take cash and checks till 8 pm witch I think is great, even though i would love to have the feature where you can scan your check over your phone.. :). I also like the keep the change program, it helps me save money without feeling it in my pocket.Overall, I'm satisfied with Bank of America, no big complaints..","2135":"Let's start by saying that Bank of America is not only one of the most important banks in the U.S. It also is very good at customer service, also delivers reliable information. I personally have a student bank account which basically allows me unlimited use of online banking, ATMs and NO monthly charges whatsoever. This is the ideal bank for me. You could also find a Bank of America ATM almost anywhere you go, it also has application to almost every smartphone and it is very easy to use, like for example to make a quick transfer between accounts, to check your balance or find a location. Every time I have a concern they always have a way to make everything better to in my personal opinion this is the perfect bank and service I could ask for, I can easily recommend Bank of America to everyone I know, you know why? Because it may have one of the top rated performance compare to others out there.","2136":"I got Bank of America while I was in college and I must say that I have been very happy with them thus far. I have had my problems with Bank of America but their customer service representatives made sure that they took care of my problems in a timely manner. Their website is very easy to use and understand. I like the fact that they allow you to check your balance either online, via text, or using their Bank of America application on any smart phone.I love the keep the change option that they offer it allows you to save a little money every time you swipe you debit card. One complaint that I do have is that you are limited to how many times you can transfer or withdraw money from your savings account. Other than that I am pretty satisfied with everything Bank of America has to offer.","2137":"The local branch of Bank of America has been nothing but helpful and courteous to me. As a recent graduate, it was high time I explored getting a checking account and credit card, and their talented staff was able to make that process a breeze. I like to think, in a way, they ushered me into the real world because of their financial heroics in my case. The facility is clean and welcoming, and the people are knowledgeable and professional. Unquestionably, if you're looking to deal with one of the big banks, Bank of America is one that should be on your radar.","2138":"I have been very happy with Bank of America since getting a college account several years ago. Their online banking service is very easy to use, and every time I've had a problem or dispute, someone has gotten back to me very quickly - usually with a good solution.They're waived overdraft fees a few times for me, and are now excellent about sending alerts to let you know if your balance is low or if you're running the risk of a being charged a fee.Online bill pay is very easy to use as well - I try and just use that so I don't have to log into four hundred different web sites.I wish their phone customer service support was a bit more consistent, however. half the time I call I get someone great, half the time it's someone who speaks very poor English and can't help me. The one time I had fraudulent charges on my account it took two calls to get it resolved, but the second guy I talked to was great.The ATM envelope free deposits are FANTASTIC - so convenient. My only other complaint is that they charge a fee even for checking your balance at an out of network ATM.Despite my slight personal preference for working with smaller, local companies, the convenience of a huge national bank like this is pretty great.","1851":"I have had accounts at two other large institutions for the last 15 years but decided to give Bank of America a try because of a bonus they were offering on new checking accounts. I opened my account online and was immediately frustrated. The process seemed easy enough at first but then it got a little confusing (and its not like I'm a computer novice). So that was strike ONE. Then after waiting a couple of weeks, I called a telephone representative to check on the status of the things that should have been mailed to me (like my new checking account debit card, PIN, and new account disclosures). The rep offered that I wait even longer and if nothing appeared to then go into the nearest branch for help (but isn't that why I chose to bank online?). This was strike TWO. I went into the bank a week later after still receiving nothing only to find a branch with 2 tellers (and at the busy lunch time hour). When I got to the window the girl already seemed like she was in a frustrated mood and that proved to be unfortunate for me because she was totally not helpful. She said I would need new accounts and that no one was working in that department right now (they were at lunch), so I would need to wait an hour. Strike THREE. I closed that account immediately. Bad service.","1960":"My mortgage is through Bank of America and has been for the last four years. I've been very pleased with the company so far. The customer service department has always been helpful, friendly and able to provide me with the information I need. I refinanced through B of A two years ago to take advantage of the lower interest rates. The process went very smoothly and I was kept up to date on all developments. The bank even called me a couple of times to check and make sure I'd received paperwork and to ask if I had any questions. Overall, Bank of America has been a great company to work with when it comes to mortgages.","1858":"Signing up for a bank account was easy. I walked into the local branch with my ID and had an account in less than 30 minutes. They even gave me starter checks until I could order my own. Bank of America has an excellent customer service system. I have never waited more than 6 minutes to be connected to an agent. And their agents have been able to solve most of my problems over the phone.The biggest problems I have encountered are the overdraft fees, and the way they pay off checks coming into your account. Bank of America pays the checks with the greatest amounts first, then smaller checks. Once I had 7 checks come into my account at the same time. Bank of America paid the largest amount, and 6 checks bounced. I was charged $35 for each bounced check. I would have preferred for them to pay the 6 checks and let the largest one bounce. I have been able to get bounced check fees removed by speaking to an agent on the phone.The only other thing I dislike is that people need ID to deposit money into your bank account. This doesn't make sense to me. And it's very inconvenient to people.","2133":"I have been a customer of Bank of America for almost 5 years now. I have had a pretty decent experience while banking with them but have also had some pretty upsetting moments.It seems that with Bank of America I have had the most difficult time of any bank discussing over draft charges. They seem to never over turn fees until I get to the point of telling them I am truly unsatisfied with how they are running things, and only then do I need to speak with one person higher up who gives me a very difficult time before over turning anything.I know it is really my fault for over drafting, but there have been occasions where my landlord doesn't cash a check for an extended period of time and finally decides to one day when my funds are low. I just won't have the money in my account until the next day that I am paid which in some instances isn't for a few days. I rack up multiple charges and have to pay back ridiculous fees because my landlord didn't cash a check in a reasonable time frame. Banks do have rules and regulations but please have a little sympathy for your long standing customers.","1857":"Bank of America is a great Bank they excel at solving customers issues. They strove to help get my issue resolved .When I called in I was having a transfer of funds being delayed on their end and I was wondering what was taking so long. I called in and when I did they searched for a resolution to my problem very quickly. They promised within 48 hours they would have my funds and I would be able to use them .As they had promised it was there and able to be used. Unlike many places i have dealt with their service was beyond superb. I rate them all 5s.","1856":"I have had almost no problems with this bank. I actually overdrew my account once by a few dollars and they waved the overdraft charge for me since it was my first. I have only had one problem ever checking my account online, which is pretty good in my book. I had Bank of Oklahoma for a while, but it was sort of a pain since whenever I traveled out of state I couldn't find my bank anywhere. I used to go on tour with bands pretty frequently and the fact that Bank of America is available in a ton of different states is a huge plus for me. All in all, I am very satisfied with Bank of America and will continue to use them for checking.","1855":"I have several accounts with Bank of America, both checking and savings accounts. I really like this bank since it has many different types of accounts to choose from and you don't have to maintain a high minimum balance. They also have a great \u201ckeep the change program\u201d where they round your purchases up to the nearest dollar and give you the difference!! The only problems that I have ever had with this bank is that they are not consistent about the dates that they withdraw the monthly fees. Sometimes they pull it on the first at other times as late as the 8th so it can be hard to keep track of. When a problem does occur though it is normally very easy to get it cleared up as they have outstanding customer service, if you don't mind a long wait. Overall it is a really customer friendly bank!","1854":"Bank of America provides many services to its customers and the interest rates are reasonable. They provide different types of accounts based on your income and age. Student accounts are made for the younger generation where there is no monthly fee on having a checking account. Adults usually have to pay a certain fee to per-month that allows them to keep the money inside the bank. They require you keep a minimum amount in your account otherwise you get a fee. You can also get overdraft protection which is good when you're younger. The bank will automatically move money from your savings over if you don't have enough in checking. Overall I would recommend doing business with them.","1853":"Bank of America has a great online website and mobile access is second to none. The ease of use is great and there are many locations all across the country. They are great to use until there is an issue. When an issue arises you are often times you are left on your own. The bank is very reluctant to help anyone without 100% perfect credit, and no matter how big of a relationship you have built with them will not look to help you when you need it. If you are looking for convenience they are great but don't count on too much help from them down the road.","1852":"I love bank of America. Have been with them for 5 years now. Any problem I have I can resolve via email or their customer service online chat. This is incredibly useful because I cannot call to fix certain issues. They are understanding and extremely helpful. I've incurred a few overdraft fees by accident and even fraudulent charges and have never had a problem being reimbursed for all of these.","2134":"I joined bank of America about a year ago and have been very happy with the services that they offer. I opened a student account with them when I was going to college. The customer service was awesome, it took me about 20 minutes to open the account. I had two overdrafts with them and they were able to waive one of the fees. After being with them for six months, they offered me a credit card. I am very pleased with Bank of America and plan to stay with them for a very long time. They are conveniently located at various hot spots. I like the fact that they do not charge you a monthly fee as long as you have direct deposit. I take advantage of their bill pay, fast and accurate.","1961":"I have no complaints about this credit card. There are lots of choices for using your reward points and they are easy to cash in. The website for the card is easy to navigate and the few times I have called customer service they have been helpful. You don\u2019t usually have opportunities to earn more than $1= 1 point so rewards do take a while to accumulate. They have deals sometimes where you can do interest free balance transfers which can be helpful but it's pretty standard. You can use it to receive AAA discounts wherever they offer them, so at hotels or stores like Payless and Walgreens you can ask for the AAA discount.","660":"I have a Bank of America checking account and I love banking here! The people in my local bank are very friendly and helpful and they make everything especially easy. If I have questions they are able to answer them quickly and correctly, while making the answer easy to understand. They have loan officers and general customer service people to help with what ever you may need. I have a no fee checking account so it is even better than other banks. I also have a CD here and their long term CD rates are better than most banks. I have had some issues with other banks, one bank had a glitch in their automatic pay system and it never paid my credit card and made me incur fees and a negative rating on my credit report, I never have any issues or problems with my Bank of America accounts. Everything works great all of the time and I like having my account with Bank of America and I will keep my accounts here!","661":"I've been a customer of Bank of America for almost 15 years now. They've gone throught the occasional changes where my free checking has been changed to a non-free account, but they've always given me plenty of warning and I've never had trouble switching it back to one of the free options. The telephone wait time for customer service is sometimes excessive though (40 minutes last time I called. I remember this stuff!), but the reps are always polite and eager to help.I'm a pretty casual banking user, though, since I mostly just use the account for simple things like paying bills and making debit purchases as I do my investing elsewhere with companies who do that exclusively.I've found Bank of America's automatic bill-pay setup to be especially easy to use. They'll send checks on my behalf to the people I owe when I schedule it, though I would expect that's true of any bank these days and I can't remember if this last has an extra fee, though. I'm pretty sure it doesn't for what I use it for.Identity theft protection has been great, too. Got dinged once for a fairly substantial amount, contested it and everything was resovled with negligible fuss, even though it was a debit transaction (which are notoriously difficult to deal with).Overall, I'm a happy customer.","662":"Bank of America has by far been my least favorite bank I have ever had the displeasure of being a member of, and I cannot wait to switch back to a credit union shortly. I signed up for the \u201cebanking\u201d account, where you do not pay fees or have a minimum balance requirement as long as you do not go into the actual bank. BoA offers services to deposit checks and money via the ATM, so I assumed there would be no reason I would need a person.Unfortunately, I was wrong. At one point, my debit card number was stolen and so I was forced to cancel my card. I was promptly notified by BoA to call them, which was quite nice so points for BoA. After I called I was reassured that my mailing address was updated from Ohio to California and that my old card was cancelled and a new one would arrive within the week. The card took two weeks so I was forced to incur multiple fees as a result of having to go into the bank to access my money. The bank would not waive the fees, even though I did not have a choice. Additionally, they sent me NOT a new card, but just a copy of the same old card. I continued racking up fraudulent charges this whole time, in addition to the account fees. They also sent the card to the wrong address. It took three tries to get a new card, something a bank should be incredibly embarrassed about. Avoid BoA.","663":"I am extremely pleased with the overall service with Bank of America. Customer service, whether at a banking branch or over the phone, is always professional and efficient. The online banking is a breeze which is primarily why we stay with them. We can pay our bills with just a few simple clicks and even transfer funds from our checking to savings, or vice versa, whenever needed. One of the best things is that we are able to transfer funds from our checking to my mom's Bank of America checking quickly online and it's free. So if she's ever down on funds, we can take care of her instantly. People are busy, Bank of America makes it easy to manage your money and time.","665":"I have had great experiences with the company and I'm rarely disappointed with the service that I receive. I have two checking accounts and two savings accounts with Bank of America. In the past, if I accidentally had an overdraft fee, and was punctual in resolving the issue, the employees were usually very helpful and understanding and would help to get the overdraft fee taken away. Bank of America has also provided me with personal banking help and investment advice for my accounts as well as for future investments in stock\/bonds. I have rarely had issues when dealing with the company aside from one or two occasions that I could not access the bank's website do to construction. The features that they offer, such as mobile banking and multi-check deposit at the atm are very beneficial to me as well. I plan on continuing my business with Bank of America for years to come.","664":"I think Bank of America is great. I\u2019ve been with them for 4-years now and I have never had an issue. Also, their website and mobile apps are a big plus for me. I live by online banking through their site and bill pay features are the best I\u2019ve seen compared to other banks. Their mobile apps for iPhone and iPad are great and easy to use on the go. Not to mention, they were one of the first banks to get rid of envelopes at their ATMs. Just insert your cash and checks and it does the counting for you. I think Bank of America has a lot of great perks for being a customer and I plan on staying here for the long haul.","666":"Bank of America had good days and it has bad days.My Complaints:1. This bank has ordered my overdrawn balances before to enhance the amount of money they get. Not sure if they still do this, but when it happened to me I was very upset.2. They were going to charge for debit cards. I see with pressure from the community after their bailout they decided to not do that. However they have charges for just about everything on a regular account. From too many transfer fees to monthly fees. Which they have raised twice since I have been a customer.The good stuff:1. They are quick to help if someone has gotten a hold of your debit card or card number. I have never had a problem getting my money refunded with BOA if something goes wrong.2. Long customer service hours. If I need help in the evening they are usually there up till 7 or 8. Which is nice for customers. I also enjoy their online chat. It's very helpful. Although if you are looking to get a charge removed I would call your local branch. Because once they tell you no online or over the phone via their 1-800 number the local branch can't do anything for you. Just a tip, I learned this the hard way.3. They will give you a break every so often if you overdraw. I think it's like once a year.Overall I enjoy BOA. I haven't found a cheaper bank yet.","1969":"Bank of America is definitely one of the most successful banks these days and they are only growing stronger. I have been going there almost my entire life for a checking account and the employees are very friendly and quick unlike other banks. They truly make you feel like you are welcome and the bank is always so clean it\u2019s amazing. There are many employees working there so you are never stuck on line with one customer that is taking forever. They sometimes have some refreshments out which are very nice and overall I just feel very comfortable with going to Bank of America and I completely recommend this place.","1962":"Bank of America has been a great bank for us to have our mortgage with as well as a credit card and a bank account. Although when we tried to refinance and the application process was a bit long with all of the paperwork and the closing costs that were hidden in various other fees made it apparent that the work involved in refinancing with Bank of America was not worth it, we are happy with the fact they accepted our decision to not follow through with refinancing and did not bother us about it. We have had no problems with them in regards to our credit card and bank account, and the online banking is convenient for us to pay our mortgage online in just a few simple steps, even from a different account.","1964":"For a large commerical bank, Bank of America seems to offer pretty good products and services. We have not had any problems so far (we have been banking with them since 2010). Every time we go into the branch the employees are very friendly, professional, and helpful with any problems or questions we may have. Also the Bank of America website is very user friendly and easy to use. I have found answers to all of my question there. I have not used the customer service line yet, so I cannot speak for that. As far as the checking account goes, we do not have any monthly fees as long as we have a direct deposit going in once a month. Overall we are very satisfied with our experiences with Bank of America.","1965":"In the beginning I was happy with this bank. My family used it for years. They were easy to use, didn't charge lots of fees, had many locations, and seemed straightforward. However, they seem to have gotten worse over the years. They began charging fees for moving money from savings to checking, which I found ridiculous. It's my money! I should be able to move it where I want. I also didn't appreciate that they didn't give me any notice when they started charging that extra fee. Instead I had to learn the hard way. They also would unexpectedly lock down my account for times they thought there was suspicious activity. I appreciate them trying to stay on top of things, but it was inconvenient to go to a store and suddenly not be able to use my debit card. None of the times I was locked out were due to actual fraud, so I'm not sure what their system flags as suspicious. I finally had enough when they cashed a check I had written that was over two years old. They shouldn't have cashed it at that point, and this resulted in an overdraft in my bank account along with a fee. I cancelled with them after that, although they still send me junk in the mail. I'm glad I stopped using them when I did, because since then they've added even more ridiculous fees. My recommendation is to look elsewhere!","1966":"I have been using BOA for a year now and it has been a very smooth transaction from the credit union I used before. I wanted to switch banks because they were a small local bank that had some good features but they weren't fitting my needs as I moved out of the area to bigger city. I needed to use my bank more often and they just didn't have all the features I needed. I decided on BOA since a friend of mine highly recommended them to me. I opened up a checking\/savings account at no cost. I also was able to get my first order of checks for free. I have run into a few problems with my account but they have been resolved as soon as I brought up the issue with them. Their reps have been very helpful and handle themselves very professionally. I have recently been approved for a credit card which will allow me to get rewarded for purchases I make while using the card. I look forward to racking up some points and also building up some credit as well. Thanks to BOA the handling of my money is no longer an issue for me.","1967":"Overall, my experience with Bank of America was pretty unsatisfactory. Occasionally when I had an issue, I would be helped by someone who was actually HELPFUL, but most of the time I was connected with someone who seemed as if they didn't have a clue what they were doing. More often than not, I was on the phone for at least 30 minutes trying to get my issue resolved, whether it be with my savings problems, or my credit application. To me, it seems as if they need to hire some people that are more knowledgeable in the job they were hired for.","1968":"I have been using Bank Of America for five years. I really enjoy the Campus Edge Checking account for students! It allows my love ones to directly deposit money into my account without any hassle. This comes in very handy when it comes to buying books for class every semester.My main problem with Bank of America has to do with their overdraft policies. There was an incident where by no action on my part, there was $200 charged due to an overdraft that snowballed. The charge was cleared up, but only after I physically had to visit the bank and clarify the mistake was on their end.","1963":"With Bank of America, I feel you get both the best, and the worst, that a bank has to offer. The best part is availability of locations - they are located everywhere! And if there is not a branch nearby, there is certainly an ATM that is easily accessible. And their presence on the web is really second to none, as far as banks are concerned. Unfortunately, the flip side is that the fees are high - much higher than working with a local credit union or smaller bank. And they charge you a fee for everything! Unless you are keeping extraordinary amounts of money with them, count on being charged monthly fees as well as convenience fees for most of your banking transactions.","667":"I have had Bank of America's Student Platinum Visa card for about 3 years now, and I have yet to feel the need to make any complaints. Since I have been banking with them for years, they approved me with an initial credit limit of $500 even though I had not established credit yet. Making your monthly payment is easy because they allow you to do it online, in the mail, or at one of their banking centers, and they send you statements regularly so you can stay informed of what you've spent. After about 6 months of making my payments on time, they raised my credit limit without me needing to do anything! The interest rate is reasonable too, and you can now personalize your card with a picture of your choice on their website. It always makes me smile when I see my dog's cute little face on the front of that card! Over all, this is a great starter credit card for students and younger crowds who want to establish credit, but do not need the responsibility of managing a high limit card.","668":"I had some Amtrak miles and I thought that redeeming them was going to be as hard as redeeming airline miles, so needless to say that I was not expecting much... When I called I was delighted to find out that they do not use all the gotcha type of tactics that airline rewards programs are known for. As a result, I was able to book tickets on the exact trains that I wanted! Finally, a rewards program where the miles\/points get you somewhere. Long story short I highly recommend the Amtrak Credit Card!","1490":"Bank of America where I hold a checking account always is friendly to deal with and the customer service people are excellent to deal with. They call you by name, are courteous and helpful. I have had my checking with them for over 25 years. I have evolved with BOA as they have!","669":"BOA VISA Power Rewards cards are a great way to build assets on the card and they are accepted everywhere. I have had to call their customer service to replace a card and they were helpful and pleasant to deal with. The interest rate is fair and you are always notified with any type of changeto the account. I have numerous friends with Power Rewards CC from BOA\/VISA. All of us have said that they take an interest in their customers and do supply good security services in the event your card is used or ID stolen. If you looking for a credit card, BOA is a good choice on the Power Rewards.","1491":"I have been extremely pleased with the overall level of service provided to me by Bank of America. I opened my checking account in 2009 after researching American banks and the fees they respectively charge for both checking and savings accounts. Bank of America proved to be the least expensive.I moved to the States from the UK, so I also needed a bank that would offer me a competitive exchange rate, in addition to free use of my UK card at American ATMs. Bank of America came out tops in both categories.They are part of the Global ATM Alliance which allows me to withdraw cash from my UK account at a Bank of America ATM, only paying the exchange rate fee, rather than the cost of simply using the machine.My only criticism of Bank of America is that there are not enough building locations around San Antonio compared to Chase, nor enough ATM machines that allow me to deposit cash as well as withdraw it.","1492":"I love my Bank of America Visa Card! Not only does this Visa card come with extended warranty coverage and a low annual percentage rate, it has Purchase Replacement which protects my purchases for a full 90 days. So, if any of the items that I purchase are broken or stolen, I can return them within 90 days and receive a replacement product. Not to mention, the card comes with $0 liability. This means that I am never held liable for fraudulent card transactions. As if that was not enough, I get automatic car rental insurance and all additional cards at no extra charge. Anyone who is looking for a great card with no hidden fees and a lot of wonderful perks, this is the card for you!","1493":"I have been using this Bank of America Credit Card for over a year. I would say this is my second favorite card after Chase. It offers cash back for almost everything when you shop with your card. The cool thing about this is that you have a priviledge if you have Bank of America's checking and or savings account. I believe you will get a extra bonus from that. Everytime you accumulated $25 worth of rewards, you could cash it out. It is easy to hit the minimum requirement as it virtually offers cashback on almost everything you buy with it. I think that is one of the best ffeatures of this card.","3527":"Fees Everywhere! I first joined this bank about 6 years ago because they had the most ATMs in my area; don't make my mistake! At first they were okay--I don't ask much, just a place to deposit and withdraw\/write checks on my cash. Now they charge steep fees for everything. $35 fees for bounced check, $35 fees for wire transfer, additional fees for bank transfer, $35 overdraft fees, $35 low balance fees, fees if you don't use your savings account often enough, fees to withdraw money from another bank's AMT on top of the fee from the other bank!\u00a0 I had a friend who overdrew her account by accident on Sunday with a large purchase, so, on her statement, they said they paid that out first and then paid out her smaller purchases on Friday and Saturday behind it so that they could charge overdraft fees for EVERY small purchase! I've been charged an overdraft fee that created a low balance in my account, so they charged me another $35 fee, a day latter, for that!\u00a0 Go with anyone else. I've had a Fidelity account for almost 2 years now and haven't looked back. Fidelity will be my sole bank account here on out.","1495":"I *love* this card and use it for very possible transaction \u2013 even for fast food, and to pay my utility bills!Not only does it give you 3% back on gas, 2% back on groceries and 1% back on everything else without having to do anything extra, they do sometimes offer time-limited bonuses as well. For instance, through June 30, I am getting 3% back on travel (they mailed me an offer that I then had to activate online), and I am also now able to activate special short-term offers for rewards at specific retailers (Starbuck\u2019s, etc.) through my account page.It pays out cash every time you accumulate $25 in rewards, but if you have a BoA checking or saving account, you get an extra 10% bonus for having your rewards deposited into it, so I actually get $27.50 each time.In addition, I can use it when purchasing through BoA\u2019a Add It Up website (https:\/\/additup.bankofamerica.com). It\u2019s a separate program that gives you up to 20% back when you go through their website to purchase from participating online retailers. I usually average between 5% - 10% back, which is in addition to the BoA credit card rewards!I make sure to pay it off when I get paid, so that I stay within budget and still get all the financials perks. The extra money here and there really helps my budget, and it's money that I would simply be giving away otherwise.","1494":"This Bank Of America Visa card is very useful. I use it wherever I go without any hassle. I have had a problem with fraud in the past and Bank Of America quickly handled the situation and issued me a refund. There are not any fees associated with this Visa card, which is also very important. You also have the option of adding your photo to the card for added security protection. This is really a great card to have and I highly recommend this card to anyone who is looking for a no hassle card. Go get this card today.","1496":"I have my mortgage through Bank of America and the customer service and mobile banking cannot be beat. The representatives are always eager to help and often suggestions for various products that make my financial life a lot simpler. I frequently transfer money, check account balances and deposit checks without visiting a teller. Their mobile app is so convenient. Two thumbs up. Finally their website makes it very easy to download transactions, review previous statements and get detailed transaction information. I highly recommend Bank of America for your mortgage and other financial needs. If you are looking for knowledgeable reps, quality customer service and technically innovative banking look no further than Bank of America.","1497":"I have been banking at Bank of America for over 10 years now and, I have never found a reason to switch to another bank. I have always been treated with respect, and whenever I found the need to contact customer service, the representatives I have spoken with were very well informed, courteous and extremely helpful. As with most banks, there are fees but I have done research and compared them to other banks and have found them to be comparable, and even lower, than other banks that I have in my local area. When visiting any of their bank branches, tellers always treat me well and always have a smile on their face. I have a local branch that I normally go to and tellers usually greet me by my first name. I know that this may seem a small thing but given the amount of people they see every day, to have them remember me makes me feel like I am important. I can honestly say that I would never even consider switching to another bank. Way to go BoA, you have truly earned a loyal customer!","1498":"In the last few years, I've found that Bank Of America checking is the best. I previously had chase, and wells fargo and I switched for a number of reasons. First off is the fees. When I signed up, there were no fees for the checking account, and I believe you can still get it without a fee. Second of all is the availability. There are so many BOA's around that no matter where you go, an ATM is just right around the corner. Third, they supply me with all the free checks that I could ever need, and a personalized debit card with my picture on it so I can't be defrauded. Overall, it's a great service and I would recommend it to anyone.","1499":"I've been a Bank of America customer for a few years now. On the whole they've done a good job, but I was unhappy when I heard my account would have a monthly fee tagged onto it.When I called their customer service asking about the new fee, their representative calmly explained that I would likely have to pay the new fee, but he wasn't sure. The uncertainty really bothered me, I called to get a simple answer, instead I was left more confused than before with no clear way to find out what I needed to know.","3528":"Simply The Worst I have banked with plenty of banks and Bank of America is by far the worst. Customer service isn't so great and the hours aren't either. Only good thing to say about them is they have a lot of locations, but that's about it. Will be closing my account immediately.","650":"Pretty good advice, fellas. Overall it seems like BofA launched these new BankAmericards with travel rewards just to throw a bone to frequent travelers who were getting cards from other companies, and what they came up with are poor imitations of some already popular products. The BankAmericard Privileges with Travel Rewards is just a more expensive Venture Card and this BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is just the Capital One Cash Rewards Card but with points and travel branding. So if you came to this page wondering if you should get the BankAmericard Travel Rewards Card, you have your answer.","653":"Bank of America is giving the people what they want: travel rewards. Travel rewards cards are some of the flashiest and most sought after cards issuers offer and BofA launched THREE new offers in ONE day. That\u2019s a lot to digest, but I\u2019ll give breaking down these offers a whirl, starting with the BankAmericard Privileges with Travel Rewards Credit Card. Don\u2019t thank me, it\u2019s my PRIVILEGE (ha, I crack myself up).The BankAmericard Privileges Card is obviously focused on travel rewards, as I\u2019m sure you can tell from its name. It doesn\u2019t offer any 0% introductory interest rates either. It does give you two rewards points for each dollar you spend across all purchases and lets you redeem them for travel purchase made anywhere rather than forcing you to redeem them through a BofA rewards site or something. You might think this seems eerily similar, and you\u2019d be right. Tha Capital One Venture Card offers basically the same rewards program, right down to the 10,000 point initial bonus. Unlike the Venture Card though, the Privileges BankAmericard charges a $75 annual bonus beginning in the second year, while the Venture Card only charges $59.As you might guess, I am still a bigger fan of the Venture Card as far as ongoing rewards are concerned. Neither boxes you in in terms of logistics, though, which is nice. Finally, let me say that if you want a card that will help you benefit this summer, I wouldn\u2019t choose either the Bank of America Travel Rewards Privileges Card or the Venture Card. I\u2019d probably pick the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card instead.","651":"Out of the three travel rewards credit cards that Bank of America just launched, this is the option geared toward small business owners (obviously). To get a true sense of this card\u2019s place in the business credit card hierarchy, I think it\u2019s important to remember that BofA is the only credit card company that abides by the rules of the CARD Act, at least as far as interest rates are concerned. Other companies can raise your interest rates on debt you haven\u2019t paid off yet whenever they want. Bank of America only does that if you miss two payments. The advice I\u2019ve seen based on this is that you can either use a single Bank of America business credit card for small business or a standard credit card for funding and a business card for making smaller purchases and earning rewards.With that in mind, let\u2019s take a closer look at the WorldPoints Travel Rewards for Business Visa Credit Card. It doesn\u2019t have an annual fee, which is nice, gives you 1.5 points per dollar you charge and 5,000 bomus points after your first purchase, and has 0% on purchases for 9 months. As far as rewards are concerned, the WorldPoints Travel Rewards Business Credit Card doesn\u2019t really compare to some of the other business cards out there. I mean, the Capital One Spark Cash for Business gives you 2% cash back on all purchases and a $100 initial bonus, and sure, it has a $59 annual fee beginning in the second year, but you can recoup that after spending $2950. The Ink Cash Business Card from Chase is another great option since it offers a $250 initial bonus, 5% cash back on the first $25k you spend on office supplies and telecom, 3% on the first $25k spent on gas and dining, and 1% on everything else. Like the BofA WorldPoints Travel Card, it doesn\u2019t have an annual fee either.Overall, I\u2019d say get the WorldPoints Travel Rewards Business Visa if you want the simplicity of using one card for business, but you can get a whole lot more value with the Ink Cash for Business and a 0% card like the Citi Simplicity.","652":"The BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is I guess the standard option in Bank of America\u2019s new suite of travel rewards credit cards (I mean the other consumer card has Privileges in the name and the WorldPoints Card is for business). Anyway if you\u2019re looking for a travel rewards credit card, you need to figure out whether the BankAmericard Travel Rewards Card is going to be the most rewarding option in light of your spending habits and interests (you don\u2019t want a card that gives you hotel rewards if you never stay at hotels).As you can see from the top of this page, the Travel Rewards BankAmericard gives you a 10,000 point initial bonus. I looked at the terms and conditions page, and you get these if $500 in purchases post to your account within the first 90 days. You also get 1.5 points per dollar spent across all purchases, which you can ultimately redeem for travel purchases that appear on your statement. (You can also redeem for cash, merchandise and charitable contributions, but I don\u2019t know if you get the same value that way). Aside from the 0% on purchases the BofA Travel Rewards Card offers, that\u2019s basically it for its benefits. You also get 3 points per dollar spent on travel purchased through BofA, but prices are usually jacked up on credit card travel programs, so I doubt this is much of a benefit.When you get down to it, this new Bank of America Travel Credit Card is decent. Whether it\u2019s the right card for you depends. The Capital One Venture Card is a better option for people who want a card for just one year or who spend a lot on travel because it offers 2 miles for every $1 but has a $59 annual fee starting in the second year (the Travel BankAmericard doesn\u2019t have an annual fee). If you want the best possible initial bonus, I\u2019d go with the Chase Sapphire Preferred ($500). And if you don\u2019t travel that much or always use the same airline or hotel chain, I\u2019d get the Blue Cash Preferred Amex or the card tied to your favorite travel provider. Aside from that, the BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is a good option, so get it if you travel a moderate amount and won\u2019t be able to earn enough with another card to warrant paying its annual fee.I\u2019d love to see what Won Buddy Lee has to say about this card too!","3529":"Bank Of America STINKS!!! Hidden charges, mad overdrafts. You can only use your card at Bank of America because they REALLY over charge you for using your card in stores. I mad a big mistake using this bank!!","3530":"Personal Loan Promises Read anything you agree to three times with personal banker at local bank + make sure it's not revolving credit line loan. I was screwed and didn't even get to enjoy it, I quess raped would be better word.","3531":"Your Credit Score Can Suffer From Banking With Bofa I think people should stay far away from Bank of America. I have been with them for 17 years and I just got off the phone with 6 different customer service reps who couldn't fix their mistake. This isn't the first time either. They accidently closed one of my 15K credit cards...twice. So they asked me twice to reapply for the card which would ding my credit. All 6 customer service reps were surprising rude considering they were the ones who made the mistake and kept blaming the other for it. No accountabilty but then what did we really expect for BofA? Even Rolling Stones had to say something about them: http:\/\/www.rollingstone.com\/politics\/news\/bank-of-america-too-crooked-to-fail-20120314 Nowadays there are so many small banks and credit unions that offer interest bearing checking and ATM fee reimbursements that it's a no brainer. I had an account with DL Evans and I made $400 in interest last year on a checking account that BofA was trying to charge a fee for.","3532":"I Wish I Could Give Them A Negative Rating!!!! Wow, I've never dealt with a company so out of touch and less regard for small business.","654":"As far as I\u2019m concerned, people have three things to consider when deciding whether an everyday rewards card like the Bank of America Accelerated Rewards American Express Card is right for them: 1) How it compares to similar cards currently being offered; 2) How well it complements your spending habits; and 3) How convenient maximizing its rewards offerings will be. So let\u2019s go one by one.1. How it Compares.Since the BofA Accelerated Rewards Amex Card only gives you a $50 initial bonus and 1.25 points per $1 spent, it\u2019s rewards really aren\u2019t competitive. You can find cards offering a couple free flights, hotel nights, and up to $500 as initial bonuses; 1.5-2% cash back across all purchases; and up to 6% cash back on major spending categories like gas and groceries.So if rewards are what youre after I\u2019d go with the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card, the Cap One Venture, the PenFed Platinum Rewards, or the American Express Blue Cash Preferred instead of the Bank of America Accelerated Rewards Card.2.\tHow it complements.This card doesn\u2019t offer any special rewards earning rates for specific spending categories, so it complements everyone\u2019s spending the same. This could make it a good everyday rewards card if it had attractive rewards, but since it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s just a missed opportunity considering that you can save 5% on gas with the PenFed Card or 6% on groceries with the Amex Blue Cash Preferred.3.\tConvenienceIm not a big fan of cards that give rewards in points. Cash back rewards are much more straightforward and do not require you to redeem often to avoid seeing your points become worth less when the credit card company ups the number you need for certain rewards. This probably wont be a big deal, but you also cant use Amex cards as many places as you can Visa or MC.Overall, the Bank of America Accelerated Rewards Amex is a fine card, especially since it doesn\u2019t have an annual fee, but you can do better.","3533":"Worst Bank Ever I went to Mexico to get some dental work done and ended up being cheated. The dentist, Montano, at BioDental Studio quoted me $130 and charged me $570 for sedation. Then, while I was sedated, he drilled 10 of my teeth without even a consultation with me on a treatment plan. When I complained to B of A, they told me that I had to get an expert opinion, which I did. About a week after filing my dispute, I get a call from B of A stating that they can not ask for money back on quality of work rendered in a foreign country. Why didn't they tell me that before I went to the trouble and expense of getting an expert opinion from another dentist? Instead, I receive a letter telling me that after all, merchants have a right to get paid for services rendered. That's like adding insult to injury, which really made me mad. Never mind, that this bank is not there when you need them, but to have the galls to tell me that I should understand that after all, merchants have a right to get paid for services rendered. Are you crazy, not for purposely bilking the client from $130 quote to $570 and not for drilling my teeth without my permission. The worst part is, the fillings were done so poorly that they trap food between my teeth causing more cavities. I initially went there to get an implant, now I need two more. Four of the fillings that Montano put in have already fallen out leaving huge holes, where I use to only have sensitivity. The first implant was charged to my Chase Freedom card. When I told Chase what happened, Chase went into action. They were extremely supportive and even when I was a few days late gathering all the information from the expert witness, within one week of filing my claim, my money including transaction fee was placed back into my account and when the merchant did not respond after two billing cycles, the case was closed with all the money returned to me. So the next time I charge anything, which card do you think I'll pull out?","655":"The BankAmericard Cash Rewards Card is an interesting offer. The reason why is that for some people, it is a really great option that will prove very lucrative, but for others it wont quite measure up to the best cards on the market. It all really depends on how much you spend on gas and groceries and whether or not you bank with Bank of America. This will become a bit more clear with a quick little pro\/con list for the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Card.Pros-\tMany cards offer more lucrative initial bonuses than the Bankamericard Cash Rewards Visa\u2019s $50, but they also tend to require that you spend a few thougsand dollars in the first few months. This card\u2019s bonus is much more attainable for less heavy spenders since you only need to spend $100 in the first 60 days to get it.-\tCash back rewards are always a plus because you know exactly what youre going to get. 3% on gas, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else is pretty good too\u2026IF you only spend around $1500 on gas and groceries every three months.-\tGetting a 10% rewards bonus is a great treat for Bank of America bank account holders as well.-\tHaving 0% for 12 months can also allow you to leave more money in the bank for longer and gain good interest.-\tHaving no annual fee on a card that offers good rewards is also pretty nice.Cons-\tSince you only get the 2%\/3% rates up to $1500 spend on gas and groceries combined each quarter, the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Visa Card will turn into a 1% cash back card when you hit this milestone.-\tThere are a few other cards out there that offer better rewards on gas and groceries.The BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card is a pretty good everyday spending credit card, but before you apply for it I suggest also checking out the Blue Cash Preferred from American Express and the PenFed Platinum Rewards Card to see which would be more lucrative for your particular spending habits.","3534":"Fees From Rght And Left I opened my BOA account only because they have offices all over US. I have my mortgage with them too for several years. They have stopped sending me statements even I never optioned out paper statement and even I have asked them several times to send paper statement, but still they do not send it to me any more. Every now and then I see they charge my account $25. I call them and they tell me they did a mistake and my mortgage is not linked to my account and the put $25 back and promise to fix it. This has been gone for several years. I am so tired of BOA.  I wish there was another way I could do my business without BOA, or at least there was a way somebody could sue the bank that without our knowledge they take money from our account.  If you find it, they will put it back, if not, I am sure they Thank you for that!","3535":"Your Custom Means Nothing To Them - They'll Take Your Money Any Way They Can I've been a customer of BoA for 30 years. Two events recently have made me decide to take my accounts elsewhere ...  The first time was when the bank erroneously charged me a service fee for three months running that caused an NSF (they had, for three months running told me that the fee would be refunded - it hadn't). The NSF was partly my fault - I had missed accounting for one direct debit. However, instead of charging me an NSF fee for the direct debit, they honored the DD, which hit the account after four small transactions, and hit me with NSF fees on the four smaller transactions. When we questioned this, the customer service rep spoke to us as if we were worthless deadbeats (I hadn't had an NSF in the previous 25 years).  They have just done exactly the same thing again. My bad for the one NSF. Their bad for deliberately turning it into four fees. I've just scheduled all my bills to be paid Monday, and will be closing my account on Tuesday. Enjoy the $200 BOA - I know you have to make ends meet, what with the gazillion dollar bonuses you have to pay your executives for knowing nothing about banking and less about customer service, but I'm taking my money elsewhere ...","3536":"Bad Service I am BOFA customer since 1995, had all my money with this Bank for 17 years. I had constantly a balance over 10K. Because of my job I couldn't take a vacation in more than 3 years. My wife my daughter and I finally planned to have one this fall. We will go to visit our parents in Europe. These being said we tried to book the tickets online using the debit card with direct access to\u00a0our account. Because my wife and daughter have a different return date we had to do two transactions one for them and one for my round trip. Everything was nice for the first transaction my wife and daughter were able to book their flights, however on the second trasaction for my round trip I had the bank denying my traansaction. I called right away the bank using the customer service number from the back of the card but the robot declared the office is closed. Following day I finally get hold of a representative\u00a0and they help me to have my card enable so I can book my ticket. Fortunately there are still available seats at the same flight but the ticket is 50$ more. I pay the price but I ask the representative to repair the damage in a way because in my opinion I wasn't at fault. She reads me a statement about the company policy and how they try to keep my account secure. I don't understand it....You let me use\u00a0MY MONEY\u00a0when you want, during your 7-5 PM\u00a0customer service working hours and only after I call you to pray you to enable my account?\u00a0i decided to take my money away and move them to another bank.","3537":"It This There Is Some Fraud Going On At The Bank BoA is out to take your cash from your account for any reason. if you do not watch them carefully, they seem to set things up so that you are charged the $35 fee even when they hit you with a fee that creates another fee. The fact that this incidences have increased indicates an active program they must be following to rip off customers. I am one of those and I have had enough. The least I can do is take my account somewhere else, and that is what I did. They do not deserve my business.","3538":"BOA = Bend Over America BOA is one of the biggest crooks on the planet and any scheme they come up with should be looked at with great scrutiny and a great deal of skepticism. These greedy creeps participated in the biggest mortgage scheme of the century that helped to put us into an economic and housing crisis that will last for at least a decade. Yet, as any of you have ever tried to get a mortgage from them lately know, they now treat their customers and potential customers as if THEY were the crooks! We are trying to get a mortgage and have credit scores of over 800, own a home that is paid off, have solid work histories for over 30 years, pay off our credit card in full each month and only have a car payment each month. We've never filed bankruptcy or had a judgment against us. We collect rent on our paid off home and are in the process of buying another home in Florida. We put down 25% as the down payment and the Loan-to-Value ratio is only 75%. But BOA is treating us like we are trying to rob them of the $135K instead of borrowing it. Each day I awaken to another litany of unreasonable and often silly demands for documentation that proves nothing more than the documentation they already have which includes 3 years of tax returns and letters of explanation for just about every deposit into our checking account that is over $1,000 for the past 3 months. We're supposed to close on our new house in a few days and they still have not given us final approval for the loan. The stress has been incredible. IF THERE IS EVER AN INDUSTRY IN NEED OF REGULATING IT IS THE BANKING INDUSTRY. But we'll never see it in our lifetime and there is very little people in the 99% can do about it. The bank that was too big to fail took taxpayer money to save it, paid out millions in bonuses to their executives and is doing nothing to help get us out of this mess that they helped to create.....unless, of course, it is a plan that benefits them first and foremost.","3539":"My Account Was In Overdraft For Months...Yet Somehow My Direct Deposited Check Was Going There Weekly I had a BOA account that i opened when I was 18, everything was fine for a year until I got a job with direct deposit. After having my payeoll check on direct deposit for 5 months I get a letter one day from a creditor saying that I owed BOA $135. I took my lunch break and went to the branch across from my job, the people inside the bank had no idea what the letter was and told me to call the number to customer service.\u00a0I contacted customers service and after various \"dropped calls\" I finally got a person who was willing to answer my questions, I had never been direspected so bad by a customer service agent in my life. The guy on the phone told me that my account had been in overdraft since November, at this time it was early February, I asked him how that was possible when my check had been on weekely direct deposit since September and on top of that I actively use my ATM card to make purchases. He tells me it just was so i asked him if that was the case why didnt they inform me before they sent the account to a creditor. The guy goes on to tell me how it is not his fault that I am an irresponsible individual and so forth and so on. After I tell him that I am trying to figure out how this overdraft was possible and why they didnt inform me if this had happened he tells me I \"don't have to be a bitch about my bad financial intelligence.\" Of course by this time I am beyond mad and late back to lunch. I had been disrespected and I now have this stupid charge on my credit and of course when I asked to transfer to to someone above him the call was \"lost.\" Eventually I called back and got a person who would handle he problem well of course that wasnt tue becasue it was still on my credit the next year. I didnt pay it instead I called BOA about it. This happened in 2008 I called them every few months until it was removed. It ws not removed until 2010. I never reccomend BOA to anyone. I won't even use an ATM that has their name on it. Not only did they put that bs on my credit, give bad customer service, have no valid response to why the charge was their, but I was direspected. That has to be the worst.","656":"Man, I bet a bar association credit card could buy a heck of a lot of drinks. Oh, wait\u2026it\u2019s not that kind of bar...it\u2019s lawyers. Oh, well, still applies. That awful lawyer joke I made up as I was writing it aside, if you\u2019re an American Bar Association member, you might be interested in showing your affiliation by getting an American Bar Association Business Credit Card. You shouldn\u2019t really think of it as the American Bar Association Business Credit Card though; think of it instead as Credit Card X and evaluate it based on its terms rather than its name. In other words, you don\u2019t want to overpay for credit card branding. Starting with rewards, the American Bar Association Business Card offers 1 rewards point per $1 spent. That\u2019s it. Moving on to rates, the Bar Association Business Card gets you 0% on purchases for 9 months. That\u2019s it. As you can probably tell, I\u2019m not wild about the Bar Association Card. At this point you might be thinking, \u201cwhat are you talking about, it gives you rewards and a 0% intro rate, what more could you ask for?\u201d First of all, you don\u2019t want to settle for an average overall card because it meets two needs. It would be much smarter to get a rewards card for everyday spending and a 0% card for saving on big ticket purchases or transferring debt. You\u2019d get better terms overall that way. Also, there are simply way better cards that you can get with the good or excellent credit you need to get the Bar Association Credit Card.What are those cards, you ask? Well, if you want rewards, I\u2019d go with the business credit card offering the best terms of your biggest expenses. The Ink Bold with Ultimate Rewards and the American Express Simply Cash Card are pretty good options. If you want low rates, I\u2019d go with the No Balance Transfer Fee Slate Card from Chase, which offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 15 months and does not charge a transfer fee. Yes, that is a personal credit card, that is intentional. You aren\u2019t put at any additional risk by using a personal credit card and get to benefit from the fact that issuers cannot increase interest rates on personal credit card unless you\u2019re at least 60 days delinquent.","657":"Diamondback fans have gotta be wondering, will Trevor Bauer make the opening day rotation or assume a role in it shortly thereafter and would the Arizona Diamondbacks Credit Card make a good addition to your wallet? As far as Bauer is concerned, he\u2019ll have to work for it, but he should soon join Hudson and Kennedy in the rotation. Deciding whether or not to get the Diamondbacks Credit Card depends on what exactly it offers since you do not want to overpay for branding, especially when you can personalize the entire front side of any Capital One credit card with the picture of your choosing and effectively turn it into a Diamondbacks Credit Card. The Diamondbacks Credit Cards rewards are as follows: 3% cash back on gas, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else and a 10% rewards bonus when you redeem your cash back into a Bank of America bank account. In terms of rates, the Diamondbacks Card offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 15 months but charges a 4% balance transfer fee.The rewards offered by the Diamondbacks Credit Card are pretty good, especially if you already have or can get a free Bank of America bank account. However, most people probably spend more on groceries than they do on gas, so for them the Blue Cash Everyday Card from Amex would be better since it offers 3% cash back at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores and 1% on everything else. The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card also offers a $500-625 initial bonus, which makes it a good option. The rates offered by the No Balance Transfer Fee Slate Card from Chase are also attractive. It gives you 0% on purchases and transfers for the same 15 months as the Diamondbacks Credit Card but does not charge any transfer fee. Depending on the size of your transferred balance, this could save you a bundle.","658":"Hey, I\u2019ll tell ya what this is one credit card with some Natitude. While I\u2019m certainly an entrenched Yankees fan, I can appreciate the fact that the Nationals are poised for big things, I\u2019m just mad we didn\u2019t keep Tyler Clippard. Anyway, you\u2019re here because you want to see if the Nationals Credit Card is worth applying for and the biggest concern you should have is about overpaying for branding. Basically you don\u2019t want to sacrifice money or card terms just to have a Nats symbol emblazoned on your card, especially since you can make that happen for free with any Capital One credit card. That being said lets take a gander at what the Washington Nationals Credit Card has to offer. Starting with rewards, the Nats Credit Card gives you 3% cash back on gas, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else. You also get a 10% rewards bonus if you redeem your cash back into a Bank of America bank account. How does this stack up to the rest of the good or excellent credit credit card market?Pretty well, actually. The Amex Blue Cash Everyday Card, which is one of the best everyday rewards cards, offers 3% cash back at supermarkets, 2% cash back at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on everything else. I guess which one is better depends on whether you spend more on groceries or gas and how much you spend at department stores. As far as rates are concerned, the Nationals Credit Card offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 12 months but charges a 4% balance transfer fee. This does not compare favorably to the likes of the No Balance Transfer Fee Slate Card from Chase, which doesn\u2019t have a transfer fee and gives 0% on purchases and transfers for 15 months. Ultimately, I\u2019d probably have to take both alternatives to the Nationals Credit Card instead of it because unlike a Stephen Strasburg fastball, it doesn\u2019t blow me away. See you guys in June.","659":"For all you O\u2019s fans out there, its unfortunately pretty clear that your team is going to be, well, terrible this year and for the foreseeable future. After all, the destructive management is still in place and ESPN did pick the O\u2019s last in its future rankings. What remains to be seen however is whether the Baltimore Orioles Credit Card is doomed for the same fate or could be a home run, so to speak. Usually I\u2019d take you through the Orioles Credit Cards\u2019 terms before revealing the answer, but I sympathize with you guys so I\u2019ll tell you now. The Orioles Rewards Card has the same terms as all of the other MLB-team-branded credit cards and while pretty good they are not necessarily the best available for people with good or excellent credit (what the O\u2019s Credit Card and other teams\u2019 cards require for approval). Here, I\u2019ll show you why.The Orioles Card offers 3% cash back on gas, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else. Compare this to a card like the Blue Cash Everyday from American Express, which offers 3% at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on everything else and it doesn\u2019t quite stack up. I mean I suppose the O\u2019s card could be better for people who spend more on gas than groceries and never shop at department stores, especially people with Bank of America bank accounts because the MLB Team credit cards give you a 10% rewards bonus when you deposit your cash back into one. At any rate, I\u2019d probably take the Chase Sapphire Preferred over the Orioles Card because the former gives you a $500-625 initial bonus. The difference between the Orioles Credit Card\u2019s rates and those of the best good or excellent credit credit cards is even more obvious. The Orioles Card offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 12 months but also charges a 4% balance transfer fee. The No Balance Transfer Fee Slate Card, on the other hand, obviously doesn\u2019t charge any sort of fee for transfers and offers 0% on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months. On other thing to point out is that if Orioles branding is all you\u2019re looking for, any Capital One credit card allows you to customize the front of your card with the picture of your choosing, so you can of course slap an O\u2019s logo or picture on there. That\u2019d sure look good payin a tab at Pickles.","1620":"There\u2019s no question that the ASPCA is a great cause. In case you didn\u2019t know, ASPCA stands for The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and as a big time animal lover (especially dogs!), I\u2019m all for giving them as much dough as possible. But is the ASPCA Credit Card the right tool with which to do so. In other words, how do the ASPCA Credit Card\u2019s rewards compare to other credit cards that require good or excellent credit for approval. While charity credit cards automatically send donations to their affiliated organization, most credit cards give you the option of donating rewards earnings and even if they don\u2019t, you can simply donate the cash gleaned from a credit card rewards program yourself. Your goal, after all, is providing the ASPCA with the most money possible. So, starting with rewards, the ASPCA Rewards Card offers 3% cash back on gas and 2% cash back on groceries up to $1,500 spent in these categories quarterly as well as 1% on everything else. You also get a 10% cash back bonus when you redeem rewards earnings into a Bank of America bank account. Unfortunately, though, the ASPCA Card does not appear to have anything to do with the ASPCA other than branding. BofA, the card\u2019s issuer, doesn\u2019t seem to donate any portion of card sales to the organization and your rewards aren\u2019t automatically donated or anything else. While the ASPCA Rewards Credit Card offers decent rewards overall, there are better cards out there. The same holds true for its rates; the ASPCA Card only gives you 0% on purchases for 12 months and does not offer a low intro rate on balance transfers.So alternatives are in order. If you want to give a lot to the ASPCA in the short term, the Chase Sapphire Card is the way to go since it offers a $500 initial bonus. Depending on your spending habits, the Capital One Cash Rewards Card (1.5% cash back across all purchases) or the Blue Cash Everyday from Amex (3% at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores and 1% everywhere else with no earning limit) are great options for ongoing donations. The good thing about getting a Capital One Card is that you can customize the entire front of your card with a picture of your choosing, which means you can turn any Capital One Card into a makeshift ASPCA Card if you so choose. Finally, if you want to get low rates, the No Balance Transfer Slate Card is the best choice.","3540":"Lousy Bank Poor customer service, fees for everything,","1621":"Chicago Cubs fans need all of the rewards they can get, considering how much heart break they\u2019ve had to deal with over the years. But is the team\u2019s co-branded credit card they way to get these rewards. I certainly get wanting to have a credit card bearing my favorite teams logo, but you do not want to sacrifice your card\u2019s terms just for branding, especially when you consider the fact that you can put any picture you want on the front of any Capital One credit card. So, we have to figure out whether the Chicago Cubs Credit Card is competitive, branding aside. Starting with rewards, the Cubs Credit Card gives you 3% cash back on gas, 2% on groceries, and 1% cash back across all other purchases. That\u2019s actually not too bad, especially in light of the fact that you get a 10% cash back bonus when you redeem your cash back into a Bank of America savings account (Bank of America issues the Cubs Rewards Card). Moving onto rates, the Chicago Cubs Rewards Credit Card offers 0% on purchases as well as balance transfers for 12 months. That\u2019s not as good as you might think since cards are available that offer 0% for as long as 18 months. Besides, the Cubs Credit Card charges a 4% balance transfer fee, whereas most other cards only charge 3% and some don\u2019t charge anything. Finally, the Cubs Rewards Credit Card requires good or excellent credit for approval and does not charge an annual fee.Ultimately, the Cubs Credit Card is decent and it wouldn\u2019t be a bad choice for those looking for everyday rewards, particularly if you have a BofA savings account or can open one. Still, I would consider a few other cards before applying for the Cubs Card. The Blue Cash Everyday from Amex offers 3% at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on everything else. The Capital One Venture Card offers basically 2% cash back across all purchases if you redeem miles for anything travel-related. The Chase Sapphire Preferred also gives you an initial bonus worth $500-625. I would not get the Cubs Rewards Card if I want low rates. Instead, I\u2019d go with the Chase Slate Card or the Discover More Card that offers 0% on purchases and transfers and does not charge an annual fee.","3541":"Will Not Provide Lien Release Had great difficulty to get a payoff number, wired the payoff, now 53 days later still can't get a lien release...

So, is it a good idea? That depends. It depends first of all on how often you travel and how often you travel with Asiana Airlines. Credit cards affiliated with specific airlines are only really worth it for people who fly a few tens of thousands of miles with the respective airline each year. If you only fly with Asiana once in a while, you won\u2019t be able to redeem the rewards you earn with the Asiana Credit Card frequently enough to benefit as much as one\u2019d like to from their rewards card or sufficiently reduce the chances of miles depreciation. I\u2019m guessing this advice will knock out a significant number of people, but if you\u2019re still interested, the next thing you need to think about is what the Asiana Airlines Card offers. The answer is that it gives you 5,000 bonus miles after your first purchase, 2 miles per $1 spent on Asiana Airlines tickets and at select grocery stores (very unusual), an annual $100 rebate on Asiana airlines tickets (largely offset by the Card\u2019s $80 annual fee), and one miles for every $1 you spend on everything else. So, to return to the original question, is the Asiana Airline Credit Card worth getting? I\u2019d say no, simply because of the other very attractive travel credit cards out there.For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card offers an initial bonus that gives you $625 toward airfare and hotel accomodations for spending $3,000 in the first three months. The Capital One Venture Card also offers an intial bonus that gives you $100 in travel and the card basically acts as a 2% cash back credit card across all purchases as long as you redeem miles for travel related purchases. Because these two cards are both more lucrative than the Asiana Air Credit Card and allow you logistical variety as far as what airline you take (even what mode of transportation you want to travel with), they are better choices.","3544":"They Were Nice At The Beginning And Now They Are Sucking Your Blod To Survive First they closed an individual account that I had for, and if I had any balance they took it to cover fees.

I pray that soon I will close those accounts and never ever comeback to do any business with this bank. I really regret ever starting with these back, and not in a credit union. I will think twice before doing business with this bank, and all the associates because they will take your money away whenever they needed without telling you.","3545":"Charged Me To Put Money IN The Bank. I have my mortgage with BOA. Never been late, never had any issues. As for the banking account I have, this has been an issue.

I had to wait 5 days for the money to make it to BOA. I could have spent that in gas and just drove. One other thing. When I opened the account, I had a check from a house I had sold that I received at the closing. I deposited it into the account. $25,000 to be exact.

It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if this little reminder led some of you former Bears to check out the Brown University Alumni Credit Card. But you shouldn\u2019t just apply for the Brown Credit Card because you went there. The general rule of thumb for affinity credit cards is that you should not overpay or waste potential just for a name, a picture or other branding. So if the Brown University Credit Card is competitive, you may want to apply for it, but if it\u2019s not, maybe just go get a sweatshirt or something and show your allegiances that way. Let\u2019s get right to evaluating what this card has to offer then. Basically all it gives you is 1 point for each dollar you spent and 0% on purchases for 12 months. That\u2019s clearly not competitive when you consider that you need excellent credit to get it and the excellent credit market is robust at the moment.You need alternatives then. The exact recommendations I would make differ based on your needs. If you need a way to save on interest, go with either the Citi Platinum Select, Diamond Select or Preferred because all of them offer 0% on purchases and transfers for 21 months. Rewards seekers have a lot of options and which route they take depends on spending habits, but some of my favorite rewards cards are the Capital One Venture Card, the Capital One Cash Credit Card, and the Chase Sapphire Preffered. The cool thing about capital one cards is that you can pout whatever picture you want on your card for free, so you could basically turn any of them into a Brown University Credit Card of sorts. Chase also has a lot of rewards partnerships with major airlines and hotel chains so its rewards are more versatile than those offered by many points credit cards.","3549":"Not What A Bank Should Be....

Just keeping my money there was costing me more than I made in interest. I closed my accounts. For the last 35 years, every time I've done business with BofA, I've regretted it. I stay away for several years, then for one reason or another I try them again.

Today, we\u2019re goin the opposite direction with the Alaska Airlines Credit Card. First of all there are two types of people who should consider the Alaska Airlines Credit Card. People who want to take a trip to Alaska or one of Alaska Airlines\u2019 other destinations and could use an initial rewards bonus offering a couple free flights and those who fly Alaska Airlines on the reg, as Kenny Powers would say. I'm not saying this card is good for either group, but the point is that not everyone can benefit from the Alaska Airlines Credit Card. Whether these groups even can depends on what it offers. First of all, the Alaska Airlines Credit Card gives you 25,000 bonus miles upon approval. It also provides a $99 companion ticket discount code whenever you book a flight through Alaska Airlines or Horizon Air. There\u2019s also the 3 miles per $1 spent on those two airlines and 1 mile per $1 spent on retail purchases.In reality it appears that the Alaska Airlines Credit Card is really only good for one group. People looking for an initial bonus won\u2019t find much here, and considering that cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred offer $625 in travel accommodations on any airline or at any hotel, something like that would both be more lucrative and provide more flexibility. The Alaska Airlines Credit Card is a fine choice for frequent Alaska Airlines flyers though, especially if you travel with family.","1626":"Are you a AAA member? If not, you shouldn\u2019t even consider the AAA Rewards Credit Card. If so, it really depends how lucrative this card is compared to the rest of the above-average credit rewards credit card market. The AAA rewards credit card offers the standard 1 point per dollar spent on all purchases in addition to 2 point per dollar spent on gas, grocery and drug store purchases, and 3 points per dollar on AAA purchases, including travel. That\u2019s about it. The 2.99% intro balance transfer rate for 12 months isn\u2019t a perk since it comes with a 4% transfer fee and there are cards out there that offer 0% for 21 months with a 3% fee.Ultimately, it only seems like you should open the AAA Rewards Card if you spend a lot through AAA each month. I mean, the Capital One Venture Card basically offers 2% cash back on all purchases if you redeem miles for anything travel related. The Blue Cash Everyday from Amex offers 3% cash back at grocery stores, 2% at gas stations and department stores and 1% on everything else. The Citi Simplicity and Platinum Select credit cards offer 0% on purchases and transfers for 21 months. There are simply no shortage of cards that are better than the AAA Rewards Credit Cards for all but the biggest AAA spenders.","3553":"BOA Just Lost A 20 Year Customer! I have been with BOA since 1991--I opened my checking account in college. Over the majority of the years, I've experienced great customer service and highly recommended the bank to others. I have had numerous car loans, equipment loans, as well as unsecured loans. One year, I carried a 20K balance on a BOA credit card. BOA has made tons of money with me as a customer over the years!  Over the past year or so, the culture has changed from great customer service to \"let me squeeze every last dime I can out of my customer.\" My first thoughts were--a sign of the times--all banks are struggling. Most recently, I learned that my automatic credit card payments were set up wrong (by me). When the days fell wrong (weekend\/holiday), I was unknowingly paying a late fee those months. Looking back, this added up to almost $100 over the past year.  Then, this issue was compounded when I allowed my checking account to go into overdraft one month. I never worried about this, because my credit card provided overdraft protection. All of a sudden, I had several hundred dollars in overdraft fees because the credit card protection was apparently null & void when payment is not received by the due date. (Two day differential in this case.)  I do realize this was all my fault, but BOA of several years ago would have said \"the error was your fault, so we will charge you one instance of overdraft ($30) and credit all the overdraft fees back to you--thank you for being a customer for 20 years.\" Now, customer service reps and managers have ZERO AUTHORITY to reverse unreasonable charges (or so I was told).  To the CEO--Was $200 in fees worth losing a 20 year customer? There were times in my life when BOA made well over $200 per month in interest alone from me as a customer.  Over the past month, I've switched all my banking to USAA, who seems to actually want my business. USAA's insurance and brokerage business is top notch, as I have been with them 20+ years too. It's sad to see what was once such a great bank go into the toilet.  Good bye Bank of America! I look forward to trashing your junk mail offering incentives for new customers.","3554":"Worst Fraud Of A Bank Boa will never again receive my business. My fianc\u00e9 and I were applying for a home loan through a different lender and he had taken out a credit card with boa his freshman year of college. Why in the.world they issued an 18 year old with no credit and no job a 2500 limit baffels me to this day, however he made hits payments on time and more than the min balance. We were instructed by the lender to immediately reduce the ammount owed on the card, so we did. Immediately after paying down the card boa dropped his credit limit to 700 (12 more than what we had just paid it down to). This destroyed his credit score and pushed back our home buying process. We had never even received a letter telling us they were dropping it nor did we ever miss a payment or pay late. With a drastic pay increase and better credit then when the card was originally issued the dropping of his credit limit can be seen as nothing more than an attack bc they were not going to get all the intrest. I will never bank with boa ever again! Don't let then do this to you too, avoid boa, I know I will.","1627":"There are a few different BankAmericard Visas, so I guess the BankAmericard Visa Card is the plain vanilla version since it doesn\u2019t have the words \u201cCash Rewards,\u201d \u201cFully Secured,\u201d \u201cSignature,\u201d etc. attached to its name. The question though is whether its terms are plain vanilla or as exciting as something like Reece\u2019s ice cream. The BankAmericard Visa Credit Card doesn\u2019t offer rewards (strike 1?) but it does offer 0% on both transfers and purchases for the first 15 months, though it charges a 4% balance transfer fee while most cards with balance transfer offers have 3% fees (strike 2?). Sure, the BankAmericard Visa Card doesn\u2019t have an annual fee, but it requires excellent credit and many other cards with the same approval criteria don\u2019t have such fees either or offer way, way better rewards. I can now say it definitively, Stike 3. The BankAmericard Visa Card just doesn\u2019t cut it in the current credit card market.You need to explore some alternatives then, and what type of card you concentrate on depends on your spending and payment habits. If you have trouble paying your monthly bills in full, you\u2019ll want a card like the Citi Simplicity Card, which offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 21 months. If you want a card with good rewards across all purchases, the Capital One Cash Credit Card, with its flat 1.5% cash back rate is a good choice. If you want a rewards bonus, go for the Chase Sapphire Preferred and it\u2019s $500 - $625 initial bonus. If you want more rewards on specific spending categories, a card like the Blue Cash Everyday from Amex, with its 3% cash back at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on everything else is a good choice, but this obviously depends on your lifestyle. Ultimately, you\u2019d have to try hard not to do better than the BankAmericard Visa Card.","3555":"Just A Bad Bank Overall... Bad customer service, fees for EVERYTHING, and overall the worst bank I've ever had. Switching banks ASAP.","1628":"Most anyone who\u2019s a fan of racing and the number 88 car would want the Kid\u2019s name and branding on their credit card. But before ya submit an application for the Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Credit Card you should see if all that would cost you anything. The Dale Jr. Credit Card doesn\u2019t have an annual fee, so you\u2019re clear on that front and there\u2019s no special fee for getting Junior\u2019s name and number on your card, but by getting this card it does appear that\u2019ll you\u2019ll be sacrificing in terms of rewards and interest rates. The Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Credit Card requires good or excellent credit for approval, but only gives you one point for every dollar spent, a 0% purchase APR, and a $25 store credit to Nascar.com in return.When it comes to initial bonuses, you can get $625 in travel or $500 in cash with the Chase Sapphire Credit Card after spending $3k in the first 3 months. In terms of the regular rewards earning rate, you can get 1.5% across all purchases with the Capital One Cash Credit Card and 3% at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on everything else with the Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express (and those are just examples). Looking at rates, you can get 0% on transfers and purchases for 21 months with the Citi Simplicity Card. You also get a 7.25% - 13.25% variable APR with the Iberia Bank Visa Classic Credit Card, which is better than the 12.99% - 20.99% you get with the Dale Earnhardt Junior Credit Card.","1629":"The BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature Card just sounds cool. But the coolest thing about rewards credit cards is saving money, so we need to see how cool the Power Rewards really are. Let\u2019s see, you get a $50 statement credit after making $100 in retail purchases in the first 60 days after account opening. (That\u2019s better than nothing, but $50 is a little small for an initial rewards bonus in the current market, and the whole forcing you into a statement credit and adding the retail purchase requirement to the deal takes away from its attractiveness). The Power Rewards BankAmericard also offers 3 points per $1 spent on gas, grocery and drug store purchases during the first 6 months (this might\u2019ve been a better deal like 5 months ago when gas prices are high, but at least right now it\u2019s not that great). The 1 point per $1 base earning rate is pretty standard, but the fact that it appears to be all you get after the first 6 months isn\u2019t thrilling. Then we get to the issue of the BankAmericard Power Rewards Card being a Visa Signature card. This is important because Visa Signature cards have a feature called No Preset Spending Limit. This means your credit limit will be determined on a monthly basis and you\u2019ll never know quite what it is. It also means that your credit utilization might be reported inaccurately to the credit bureaus and your credit score could fall for no good reason.You should then consider options in the place of the BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature Card. The Chase Sapphire Preferred is a good choice if you want a lucrative initial bonus. The Capital One Cash Credit Card or Venture Card are nice choices for earning ongoing rewards. And if you were drawn to the Power Rewards Bank of America card for the 0% it offers on purchases or balance transfers for the first 12 months, then the Citi Simplicity card (0% on both for 21 months) or the Citi Dividend World MasterCard (0% on purchases for 15 months and some interesting rewards) would both be better choices than the Bankamericard Power Rewards Credit Card.","3556":"They Offer Regular Services, But Have Many Fees And Terrible Customer Service I started with Bank of America as a child and kept their services until just after college. I was unhappy with their many fees, but as I always had a steady job, I didn't have too much trouble with this. Besides, I just thought many fees were the norm. However after learning of their many illegal actions and the many cases both private citizens and the US government held against them, and frustrated with the proposed $5 debit card fee, I closed my account and went to a local credit union. After I had closed my account, I had some difficulty because a paycheck was direct deposited to my old, closed account. When I called Bank of America about this, they told me the funds had not been deposited and that they could not hold them for me when they were received. Instead the funds would be sent back to my employer. Working with my HR department, I found out that the funds had actually been deposited and that the customer service representative had simply not taken the time to look it up and lied to me about it. When I called them again, they were unapologetic, refused to help me, would not send the funds to my new account, and were in general rude and unhelpful. This was not the first time a Bank of America employee gave me false information. I was assured by the branch manager that foreign currency exchange services were offered during one visit to a BoA branch. \u00a0A few days later I went backt to the same branch at the same time and spoke with the same person to deposit about $20 in Euros into my account. \u00a0On this instance though, I was informed that only paper foreign currency was accepted (despite the fact that 1 Euro and 2 Euro are only offered in coin form), and only at certain times during the day. \u00a0Thus, they were completely unable to help me with this service. \u00a0I would have liked to have been informed of that before I dragged that heavy sack of coins around with me all day. \u00a0 In short, most of my experience with Bank of America was a case of trusting ignorance. When I learned the truth about their illegal practices and went with a new bank, they were unhelpful and rude to me during the transition.","3557":"I Love Bank Of America!

It\u2019s a way to set themselves apart and a reason to smile every time they open their wallets. But the mistake too many people make is sacrificing value for branding. By that I mean if you have to pay more or get less rewards for a credit card just because it has a certain picture or name that plays on your interests, don\u2019t get that card. Unfortunately, this is the case for golfers and the PGA Tour Credit Card. This PGA branded Bank of America credit card requires above-average credit for approval and only offers 1 point for every dollar you spend in return. That\u2019s just not competitive in today\u2019s market, so to use golf lingo, I\u2019d have to say that the PGA Tour Credit Card doesn\u2019t make the cut.The obvious question is if the BofA PGA Credit card won\u2019t be around for the weekend, what card or cards will. If you like traveling to PGA events, a good generic travel rewards card like the Venture from Capital One would be a better choice than the PGA credit card. It offers basically 2% cash back when you redeem miles for travel charges. Anyone who\u2019s been to a PGA tournament recently also knows that having an American express credit card gets you those course vision portable tvs that allow you to see the broadcast feed and keep up with what\u2019s going on with the rest of the field when following a certain group or staying stationed at a particular hole. If I had to pick an Amex card to get instead of the PGA Tour Credit Card, Id go with the Blue Cash Everyday Card because it offers a $100 sign-up bonus (think greens fees) and 3% cash back on purchases made at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores and 1% on everything else. So just call your interest in the PGA Tour Credit Card from Bank of America a mulligan and hit another shot.","3558":"Ridiculous Fees, CLOSE ACCOUNT ASAP Ridiculous Fees, CLOSE ACCOUNT ASAP.","1311":"If Jack Bauer tells you to get a credit card, you get it because you sure don\u2019t want to see him mad. Just kidding, but you may recognize the BankAmericard Cash Rewards name from the commercials with Kiefer Sutherland where people are talking about how confusing credit card rewards can be with all the rules and restrictions and how simple their BankAmericard Cash Rewards Cards are in comparison. You have to wonder how accurate that is though. Is the card really good enough to warrant the people in the commercial saying they \u201clove\u201d it? Well it\u2019s important to point out that the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit has changed since these commercials were first run. While simplicity is still the main message, the rewards available with what is now called the BankAmericard Cash Rewards\u2122 Visa Signature\u00ae Card - New Cash Rewards and Bonus Offer have progressed from an easy-to-keep-track-of 1% cash back on all purchases to 3% cash back on gas purchases, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else. This is not the only change made to the Cash Back BankAmericard though. Where there was previously no limit to the rewards you could earn, the 3% on gas and 2% on groceries only apply to the first $1500 you spend in these categories combined. You also get a $50 initial rewards bonus.So it seems like Bank of America is doing the exact things it condemned in its previous advertising. But any problems you might have with the hypocrisy of the situation don\u2019t make the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Visa Signature Card bad. What make it not the best option are the limits and the fact that it is a Visa Signature Card. Most people want simplicity and convenience from their cash rewards and the earning caps with this product add something to worry about. Also Visa Signature Cards have a feature called NPSL, which means you don\u2019t have a set credit limit and that your credit utilization won\u2019t be accurately conveyed to credit bureaus. This can make planning purchases difficult and also hurt your credit score. Anyway, if you want a 1-2-3 rewards card the Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express is better than the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card because it offers 3% cash back on groceries, 2% on gas station and department store purchases, and 1% on everything else without earning limits or other restrictions. It also has double the initial bonus offered by the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Visa. Uhoh, it looks like the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Visa Signature Credit Card is going to have to reinvent itself yet again.","1312":"I suppose \u201cAccelerated Rewards\u201d are those that you earn faster, but one would think that this must be relative to something and highly dependant on your spending habits. The Bank of America Accelerated Rewards Credit Card from American Express can\u2019t have gotten its name from a comparison with other cards that offer a certain cash back rate across all purchases though because it only offers 1.25% cash back while the Capital One Cash Credit Card for example offers 1.5%. And if you spend a lot in certain expense categories, you would certainly earn rewards faster with a card that offers elevated rewards in those particular categories than with the Bank of America Accelerated Rewards American Express Card. Maybe the rewards are accelerated relative to other BofA cards or other Amex cards or maybe the card\u2019s name is just misleading. Whatever the case may be, it\u2019s pretty clear that there are better available options for people with excellent credit.If you want an initial rewards bonus better than the $50 you get with the Accelerated Rewards Credit Card, opt for the Chase Sapphire Preferred. It offers either $625 in travel or $500 in cash. If you want a better base cash back rate, get the previously mentioned CapOne Cash Card. If you want 0% on purchases or transfers, get the Citi Simplicity Card (21 months on both). Like the Accelerated Rewards Credit Card, none of these cards have annual fees during the first year and only the Chase Sapphire Card has one beginning in the second ($95). I\u2019d therefore cross the Bank of America Accelerated Rewards Credit Card from American Express off your list of potential options to apply for.","3559":"Hands Down The WORST Customer Service...

This card, like most other alumni cards, is offered by Bank of America and requires good\/excellent credit for approval. You might then be expecting some really interesting rewards considering what you can get with good or excellent credit in the traditional rewards and low interest credit card genres, in which case you may be disappointed that this card only gives you one point for each dollar you spend, which can be redeemed for the usual merchandise, travel, gift cards and charitable donations.One would think that BofA would donate a certain percentage of your spending with the OU credit card to the school, allow you to redeem points for unique OU experiences, or provide some other unique perk to explain why this card gets OU branding, but I was unable to find any on either the University of Oklahoma online credit card application or the OU website. I therefore don\u2019t really see the point to getting the OU credit card. In doing so, you would be sacrificing a heck of a lot of rewards potential basically to have the OU logo on your card, which you can do for free if you simply personalize any Capital one credit card. By the way, from what I can tell OU Homecoming festivities will be taking place from Oct. 17 \u2013 Oct. 22, culminating with a home football game against Texas Tech.","1314":"After getting into rewards credit cards that could fuel my fandom of the New York Yankees for a while there, I have decided to review college alumni credit cards in the spirit of Homecoming.

So, for all you Golden Bears looking to give back to the institution that educated you, I recommend getting the best possible cash back credit card because you then have the option to use your rewards for whatever you want, including charitable donations, merchandise, memorabilia, travel, etc.","3567":"Buying A Mortgage Cautioned From Bofa Anyone thinking about starting a mortgage with Bank Of America may want to reconsider.

I just completed the loan process with Bank of America and some of the problems I faced were, No communication with me or inability for the loan specialist at Bank Of America to take messages., loan information going to an email address I never provided or used costing valuable time, in other words I never received some very important information, not making the closing date on time, this is one of the most important necessities of a mortgage purchase, this failure on Bank of America\u2019s behalf cost me the seller paid escrow fee of 1500 dollars, the whole process was horrible and this was a little mortgage for under 50K. Bank of America had me down for five and one half percent interest, most lenders are going for four and one half percent or under Its is more involved, what happens after your loan is approved, more than likely there will be more mistakes long term, you may have to deal with, lost payments, Bank of America changing addresses without notification, poor customer communication and many more variables. I pulled out of the loan the same day the documents were ready to sign and close, remember this was after the closing deadline, Bank of America offered me 1000 dollars to change my mine, I explained all the problems I had with this loan and no employee at this branch including the manager seemed to care.. They proved how fast they could work when they were loosing my account by getting the docs in at 9:30pm in order to save the account and make the second deadline. Do yourself a favor, the odds are against you. After all I was a 25 year customer, that doesn\u2019t mean much these days. Remember, you have to live with a mortgage for a very long time so do yourself a favor, shop around for the best, most honest deal you can find.","1315":"In honor of what the Detroit Tigers will be doing after tonight\u2019s critical Game 5, I\u2019ve decided to take a look at what the Bass Pro Shops Credit Card has to offer (get it, they\u2019ll be fishing because their season\u2019ll be over!). For starters, the Bas Pro Shops credit card is for people with at least good credit and does not have an annual fee, pretty much par for the course for rewards credit cards. Speaking of rewards, it offers 4 points per dollar spent on any purchase of Bass Pro Shop-branded merchandise, 2 points\/$1 on purchases made at Bass Pro Shop stores or via the popular fishing and outdoor supply store\u2019s website or catalog, and 1 point for everything else. You also get a $100 gas card, good at any gas station chain, after spending 200 bucks in the first 90 of being a cardholder. This Bas Pro card even offers 0% on purchases for 12 months.That all sounds great on the surface, but the real question should be how this card stacks up against the best rewards cards for good or excellent credit, especially since the rewards you earn with them can be redeemed for a number of things, including cash, travel, dining and merchandise, not ONLY Bass Pro Shop Gift Certificates, as is the case with this card. Well, every 500 points you earn with the Bass Pro Credit Card can be redeemed for $10 in Bass Pro Gift Certificates. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but that would seem to make it at worst essentially a Bass-Pro-centric 2% cash back credit card with a decent initial bonus. Not too bad, and while I think I\u2019d still take Capital One\u2019s Cash Credit Card, which offers 1.5% cash back across all purchases, so as not to push myself into a corner as far as rewards redemption, it should work well for any of the Tigers or any Bass Pro fanatics out there. Go Yanks!","1316":"It occurred to me just the other day that air travel and a credit card that rewards you for such aren\u2019t necessarily the only ways to get to a Yankees playoff game this fall and lower the cost of doing so. There are, of course, other modes of transportation, so I decided to take a look at the Amtrak Credit Card to see what kind of perks it offers. First of all, this card requires at least good credit, so if you don\u2019t have a good or excellent credit score, don\u2019t bother applying for the Amtrak Card or reading further. If you do, the Amtrak credit card doesn\u2019t have an annual fee and offers a base rewards earning rate of one point per dollar spent, 2 points per dollar spent on Amtrak purchases, 5% of your points back every time you redeem and, perhaps most importantly for saving in the short term, 18,000 bonus points after you make your first purchase. Seeing as you can get a regular coach fare class ticket for 3,000 points, a business class fare for 8,000 points and your own bedroom on an overnight train for 20,000 points, that seems like a pretty good deal. So, if you want to take advantage of this card\u2019s attractive initial bonus or you frequently travel with Amtrak and want to effectively lower the cost of this expense, why not add the Amtrak Card to your rewards credit card collection? I would not make this card your main rewards credit card though because you can find a cash back credit card like the Capital One Cash Card that will be both less hassle and more lucrative, given the 1.5% cash back it provides across all purchases.","3568":"Lifetime Bofa Customer, No Longer... My family HAS HAD multiple accounts with BofA, personal and more importantly business. Yeah, we closed them all out. The more digital banking becomes, the less personal they all get, but BofA is making it an art.  Poor customer phone service, hidden fees, horrible responsiveness to real issues, inability to quickly handle simple requests, changing fees and policies without adequate notice, (I find out about BofA changes from news, not the bank...tisk tisk.)  Now, most recently because I travel a lot, I use a mobile app....WHY IN THE WORLD DOES BOFA NEED ACCESS TO MY PHONE CONTACTS FOR MOBILE BANKING? Just another way to steal information and sell\/market to it. THAT IS A COMPLETE AND SERIOUS INVASION OF RIGHTS AND PRIVACY. I should never have to consider if my bank is hacking into my phone contacts...  Then, the $5 debit card fee...so let me get this straight, they already get my money, which they can loan out and make more money off of, I get a crap savings fee, and now just to use my debit card, I have to pay as well...I am not sure where there is any benefit in that.   Also, not happy with the fact BofA got bailed out and since, policies have really taken a dive past few years. I guess they know, no matter how awful or corrupt they get, good ole Uncle Sam and our dirty, greed politicians will cover their special interest butts and take care of them, yet again leaving the little people out in the cold...  I am sick and tired of corporations taking more and giving less, and us being told to be thankful for it. GO TO A COMMUNITY BANK!!! While they may have some issues as well, take pride in knowing you are supporting the \"Mom and Pops\" of America in essence.  Dirty corporations and evil politicians have ruined America to a point of no return. It is now up to the people to take serious control of their money and lives, because there is no other way to make changes when the people in office to protect us are hand-in-hand with the corporations.","3569":"Fees For Use Of Own Money Another step backward for this bank now that the announcement of a fee for use of their debit card has been made.\u00a0 I called the NC corporate office (CEO) and got an arrogant and mean spirited response when I complained about this fee.\u00a0 So, restrict its use...and back to cash.\u00a0 BA has grown significantly more hostile to its customers during the past few years.\u00a0 Do not ask, do not care, do not collect $50.00.","1317":"So, in the latest installment of my little credit card review series (it\u2019s turning into a series, but really I just research and write about credit cards when I\u2019m bored because I\u2019m weird and find it interesting) I touched on the fact that you can find a rewards credit card related to basically any niche interest you may have\u2014even your favorite sports team. And with the Yankees having recently clinched the AL East as well as home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, which are set to begin in just a few days, I thought, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I see what credit card companies are doing to reward the greatest baseball fans on the planet?\u201d.Unfortunately, the answer is that we don\u2019t get bonus rewards just for being Yankees fans. Bank of America does offer this Major League Baseball credit card, which you can personalize with your favorite team\u2019s logo, but the basic rewards earning rate (1 point\/$1 spent), bonus rewards (10,000 bonus points after at least $250 in purchases post to your account within 90 of becoming a cardholder), and special perks (20% off on MLB shop purchases and the ability to redeem points for merchandise and memorabilia) are the same regardless of whether you root for Jeter and the boys or the lowly Baltimore Orioles. And that, my friends, just doesn\u2019t seem right. This isn\u2019t Little League anymore. There are winners and losers in professional sports, and the Yankees and their fans are the biggest winners of all, so I say that we deserve AT LEAST 2% cash back. I, of course, say this with my tongue planted firmly in my cheek, but go Yanks nonetheless! By the way, who\u2019s rooting for the Rays tonight?","1318":"Here's a gem:\"No pre-set spending limit does not necessarily mean unlimited spending.\"YES IT DOES. I wasted an hour on the phone with these morons applying for this card, even though the first thing I said on the call was \"I spend at least $100k \/ month and need a NO LIMIT charge card. Can you help me?\" He said yes, but after an hour on the phone he says \"Congratulations, we have approved you for a $10,000 no-limit card.\" After several minutes trying to make him understand that $10k is a LIMIT and I was led to believe this was a NO LIMIT card, I hung up in frustration.Bank of America, I freaking hate you.","1319":"Ok, so I\u2019ve been interested in credit cards for a long time, particularly those that offer rewards, because I think it\u2019s interesting that you can save or get free stuff just by making a purchase with one piece of plastic as opposed to another. I\u2019ve just recently started exploring this interest in depth though, and the sheer extent of the rewards credit card market and the seemingly countless different types of cards targeted to niche interests and tied to various companies has amazed me. I mean if you want a card tied to your school\u2019s alumni association, it\u2019s there. If you want one that shows your support for a sports team (Go Yanks and Giants!), take your pick. You can even get a card that gives auto insurance rewards.Take this AAA Cash Rewards Credit Card, for example. It gives you 2% cash back on AAA travel purchases, purchases made at AAA retailers and AAA Mid-Atlantic Insurance Group premiums as well as 1% on everything else and doesn\u2019t have an annual membership fee. While I wouldn\u2019t recommend using this card as your main rewards credit card given that a card like the Capital One Cash Card offers 1.5% on all purchases and it certainly doesn\u2019t meet my particular needs, it could make a good addition to your rewards card collection if you have AAA insurance and spend a couple grand on AAA-related purchases per annum. After all, I really see the value in having a few different rewards credit cards tied to specific interests. This allows you to get the maximum market rewards value on every purchase category and save as much as possible.","3570":"Worst Bank Ever! The only reason I gave them one star was because there is not a negative star. The entire time I dealt with this bank it was trouble. I never felt better leaving a bank than the day I closed my account with BOA. I refuse to even use their ATM's. Hopefully they will collapse soon.","3571":"ATM Deposit Issues I recently made an ATM deposit at my local BOA. I put the check in, and the machine told me that there was a problem with the transaction, and that I would have to call the electronic dispute number. I call. They tell me that I will have to wait 10 business days for the dispute to be resolved. I'm not disputing anything, just depositing a check from a contractor that I did a job for. According to the branch manager, the ATM that I used is not serviced by that branch, even though it is attached to the side of the bank. After 10 days without a letter or telephone call, I finally call the same dispute phone number to find out what is going on. They proceed to tell me that because I deposited another check for the same amount a few days later that they considered that to be a replacement for the original deposit. So the original \"disputed\" check will not be credited to my account. All of this without calling me or asking me about this. Now it will be an additional 10 business days for the dispute process to work itself out. It's not like the check was for that much ($1700.00), but I have been out this money for almost 1 month now. I am a small business owner, and that is a pretty big hit for me and my employees. I\"m now changing to my local credit union. Not as many ATM's, but I will take the service over this place any day.","3572":"I Would Give Them A ZERO But You Can't. THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS!!!!!

Well the little guys should show them who makes this economy run!","3573":"Bank Of America Not Servicing Home Loans I hope BoA goes down the toilet just like their farmed out work to India, and taking jobs from American workers. Also, for most mortgage holders BoA just services the loan from either Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. They're going to put themselves out of business for trusting BoA. What really stinks is that it was all our tax money which bailed them out, and they simply do not care about the people that bailed them out. Customer service, lol, the biggest joke ever. And what happened to all the money that is supposed to go to modifications, such as making homes affordable from the government? They do not help the people who need it, they just say you are denied, no explanation of any sort. Look, I'm no angel, and everybody has hard times, but I hope all who work for BoA get a large piece of humble pie, because what goes up will eventually come down........BOTTOM LINE, WE MADE THEM WE CAN CRUMBLE THEM.","3574":"Bank Of America Website Gets An F! Bank of America is our bank only because of repeated buyouts of our previous banks...and we\u00a0aren't happy with\u00a0it.\u00a0\u00a0Finding information on their website is frustrating to say the least and when I email for information, they usually say they can't respond and I need to call someone.\u00a0 Calling is just as bad because after taking a long time to get through to a person, it is usually someone who is also not knowlegeable. Their interest rates are extremely low and getting lower.\u00a0 They are the only bank I know of that can't post your\u00a0monthly interest\u00a0paid on CD's.\u00a0 All they will do is give the balance, making it necessary to subtract each month from the previous balance to find the interest.\u00a0 They seem to purposely hide or make difficult to find\u00a0any information about fees.\u00a0 Try finding out what their early withdrawal policy on CD's is!\u00a0\u00a0 It can't be found anywhere on their website.\u00a0 The only thing preventing our switching to another bank is the hassle it would be to change all our automatic payments.\u00a0","3576":"Need More Tellers I have been with this bank for years. They need to staff their banks with enough tellers to avoid long waits. I have experienced this at many different times of day. I am pulling out all my accounts.","3575":"One Time Happy Customer - No Longer A Customer - Thanks BOA I had been a very happy customer of Bank of America for over 18 years, until Monday, August 1st, 2011, when BOA turned my world upside down.I went online that evening to check my balance and it was not showing my checking or savings account.\u00a0 So I picked up the phone and called customer service and they proceeded to tell me that my accounts had been closed due to being compromised.\u00a0 They gave me a different number to call.\u00a0 I called that number immediately and they were closed until 9AM CST.\u00a0 I called right at 9AM sharp and stayed on hold for at least 20 minutes prior to speaking with their associate.\u00a0 Well here is where it really goes down hill.\u00a0 I was informed our accounts had been closed due to my husbands SSN being incorrect.\u00a0 I was shocked, they proceeded to tell me they had sent a W-9 to my home in January and how nice they had been to give me until August 1st to correct this issue. I had never received anything from BOA informing us that there was a issue of any type with our accounts.\u00a0 BOA has my email address and they did send plenty of junk emails, they never sent me an alert via my online banking, they never mailed anything to my home, never gave us a call, nothing, nothing at all, they just closed our accounts without any regard on how this would affect us.\u00a0 As the call progressed the more shocked I became.\u00a0 I explained to them that we had called them in June due to my husbands debit card not working, and we were told at that time it had been reported lost or stolen, which we\u00a0hadn't done and\u00a0as\u00a0it turns out\u00a0wasn't the case at all.\u00a0 Never once\u00a0did they mention there was a problem with our accounts.\u00a0I have now discovered that BOA had suspended my husbands debit card at that time so we would call to get the SSN issue corrected.\u00a0 HELLO, does the right hand know what the left hand is doing, nope not at all, they just mailed my husband a new card and sent us on our way. I spoke with 4 different associates during my two\u00a0calls on Tuesday, August 2nd and not one of them had any interest in helping me.\u00a0 My accounts remain closed, but I can open new ones with them, LOL, like thats going to happen,\u00a0and I sure won't be banking with them EVER again.\u00a0All 4 of they associates told me there was no way for me to get\u00a0the money in my accounts as they intended on mailing me a cashiers check today, Friday, 5 days after they closed my account.\u00a0 Well quess what, I went to a branch and demanded they give me my money, and I will admit the associate at the branch was very nice, and she did get my money for me.\u00a0 At this point, I can't get any statements, as I kept them online, I can't get any of my bill pay information.\u00a0 I am going to have to spend alot of time now trying to contact all my service providers and have them stop either sending my bills to BOA and\/or stop taking the automatic payments from that account, what a PITA.\u00a0 I will do all\u00a0I can to get this information out to as many people as I can.\u00a0 BOA had no right to do what they did and then to just flat out not care and have no regard for a long term customer is just shameful.\u00a0 They get negative stars from me.","3577":"Simply The Worst Back when I was in College in the late 1960's, I worked as an investigator in the banking business. Bank of America was just a California Institution then, but they developed the \"Bank on every street corner\" business model, and they got rich. Unfortunately, that was the last good idea they ever had. Even back in the 1960's, they were known as \"The Dumbest Bank in America.\" Unfortunately, they buy up everybody. I find a credit card I like, Bank of America buys it and trashes it. Twice I have left after the merger announcement, but this last time I stuck with them. I'm not sure whether it was a decision, or that I'm older, and it was just inertia. Bad mistake. There have been many problems, alnd I won't waste your time with all of them. I'll keep it to two. I buy regularly from a website in India. Anyone who can read could look at my sttatements and know this. Yet suddenly BOA security people decided that my latest India charge was fraudulent, so they shut down my card. They neglected to inform me of this little detail, so a number of charges were kicked back, damaging my reputation. One charge that was refused was for the medicine that keeps me alive. Secondly, this is the text of a message I left on their website feedback page today: \"Absolutely the worst financial website in the world. It's so cluttered that the site designers can't keep track of the complexities, and links wind up taking you to the wrong places. It takes too many clicks to get down to business. Today another layer has been added that I have to get through to get to my Mastercard account information, AND IT DOESN'T WORK!!! I click on my account, or on the \"account details\" tab, and it takes me to a page topped with \"How do you want to pay?\" along with a bunch of dumb ads. I never was able to find my balance, check the transaction I wanted to check, or redeem my rewards (I should have over 40,000 points, and I want a check). Absolutely pathetic. Would you people PLEASE stop buying up good companies and ruining them?\" Stay away of BOA. Enough said.","3578":"Bofa Sucks!! I made a mistake and went through BofA for my mortgage. Worst mistake of my life!   1. A few months after we bought the house we got married. BofA said to change my name to my now married name. It was going to cost almost $20,000 just to change a name...really?!? So, umm no.   2. My husband was laid off at work. I called BofA to tell them I couldn't make all the payment, but I could make some. They told me to pay what I could and they were gonna set me up for a \"loan modification\" and it would take 7-10 days to get my \"package\" in the mail. The next month I called about the same thing, and they told me the same thing. When I told the girl I haven't received my \"package\" she said it could take 30-45 days. The next month I called and the lady said that they have never spoken with me about anything! WHAT! Are you freaking kidding me!!! She then told me to STOP paying and wait for my \"package\" to arrive.   3. Waited 7 months! to get 7 papers that could have been emailed to me! I gathered up all my info and sent it back the following week.   4. 3 months later I was told that I had been denied b\/c I had whited out my bank account number. Ok fine...that was my mistake. I didn't feel comfortable sending my bank account number through the mail! My bad. But really, nobody could have called and told me? Or emailed me, or sent me something through the mail? I was calling every other day and nobody told me!   5. After that they said I could go through an \"in house modification\" where in 30-45 days I will know if I'm approved or not. 2 weeks later they denied me b\/c my husband hadn't had his job for more than a year! Well duh!! That's what got me in this situation in the first place!!   6. I found that out on June 1st that on June 6th my house went to auction, but it didn't sell. I am now being forced to move out of my home that I was led to believe for a year that I was going through an in home modification! After I was denied my 2nd time I said I wanted to \"APPEAL IT\". As far as I knew I was in the middle of an appeal, and then I started getting letters from attorneys offices telling me I had to vacate the property and appear in court.   7. BofA is the worst bank I've EVER banked with! I will be closing my 2 savings accounts and my credit card through them.   8. My mother in Law works for BofA in the loan modification dept, and told me that they are trained to lie to people. She said it's a Q and A. We ask a question, they find the answer on their paper and tell us. She would tell me exactly what they were going to say, and she was always right! I would call day after day, sometimes 3-5 times a day and they would tell me I haven't called in 2 months! Again...are you freaking kidding me?!?   9. I'm glad to be done with BofA! I'm tired of the heart-ache, crying over this, stressing over it, etc. I've been so depressed for a year now b\/c I didn't know what was going to happen next.   10. Go with another bank!! Please!!

We have been under the impression for the last year and a half that they were working with us to find a way to save our home from foreclosure. They weren't! All we have been handed during this time is lies and two bit talk to lead us to believe them, and let our guard down a tad. We were up for their Modification Program, which sounds a lot like a campaign used by the Nazi's, Surprise! We were turned down even though we have a current income of around $1500 a month thanks to the lack of jobs and the economy. So if we were turned down, who the hell is eligible for this plan, because anyone in a worse predicament could never afford a house. Bank of America never cared about us as its customer and from what I have seen on all other web-sites, they don't care about any of their other ones either. So, Bank of America thanks for taking the last thing my Dad helped me get before he passed on and turning my warm loving home into a cold material house which you will never sale because of the economy.

They\u00a0time things so if you could be overdrawn it will happen. They\u00a0hold deposits as long as is legally possible. Their customer service is average for normal matters but is poor for any issues that cut into their profits. Yesterday I used their online form to open a joint savings account with my adult daughter so we could both have access to the money for her wedding. We were declined for no reason, even though we both have accounts at BOA. We have been told to wait for a letter explaining why.

Have mortgage with BOA & also with BB&T. The difference is stunning...go with BB&T....","3587":"Why I Wish I Never Opened A Bank Of America Account It has been a LONG time since I have gotten this upset. I won't go into details but here's how it breaks down. 1. I've been a customer of BOA since 2003. I have never received any nice perks nor have I ever experienced an extraordinary show of customer service. 2. When I was in middle school, I was set up with a checking and savings account. I was told that if my checking account had an overdraft, my savings account would cover it. Nowhere in my paperwork did it state that there would be a $20 fee. I have still to this date not found this fee in any of their terms and agreements. It's such a stereotype but there really are hidden fees. 3. Their online bill pay is not reliable. People choose to pay online because they trust that BOA will do what they are supposed to do. Instead, canceled payments have still gone through; payments have arrived late; and scheduled payments magically disappear. Their excuse is that I need to print confirmations and hold onto them for 60 days but then again, how is that convenient? 4. This branch's manager assured me that she would reverse my late fee which was as a result of their flawed online bill pay system, let me know that I would get a follow-up call in a few days; and would cancel my pending online bill payments. Instead, the late fee was still there, I never got a call, and the canceled bill payment still went through. 5. Branch managers have more authority than the customer service reps at the 1(800) number. This means that for some issues, you have to go into a branch. How convenient. 6. The customer service reps don't have the slightest clue what customer service means. I get interrupted, transferred to machines where I have to re-state my issue MULTIPLE times; talked back to; told NO NO NO; and lied to. Supposedly they document all phone calls but they don't. You cannot count on all of them to follow through or do what they say; some reps have been good but the negative overshadows those few individuals that try and do a good job. 7. Checking, savings, and CD interest rates are a joke. Do yourself a favor and open a Schwab.","3588":"Not For A Lay Man Bank Bank of America is huge, huge banking institute that, as expected, does not care much for the masses. Although, it is evident, that they do care about extracting your last single penny out of you in order to run! Students, people with average to low income, please refrain from opening an account here. My review is not about any particular type of account or any branch. It is in general pertaining to BOA and its policies that are adopted all over the country. The interest rates for deposits, savings accounts and similar are low, even lower for smaller deposits or terms and the loan interest rates are high. Credit card rates are super high, the limits pretty low and the charges stupendous. All in all I will ask every \"lay-man\" to go to a smaller local bank or even a credit union that will actually care for you.","3589":"Convinient With Lots Of Useful Services, But WILL Nickel And Dime You I've been a Bank of America customer for about 6 years now and I have both good and bad things to say about the bank. They're online banking website is excellent. It is very easy to use and has many useful features. They're customer service is also pretty good, they have very convenient hours and the wait times aren't often too long. Bank of America offers a ton of different types of bank accounts, credit cards, and investment services. My main problem with Bank of America is their services fees. They charge you for a savings account, have ridiculous overdraft charges, and a bunch of other outrageous service charges. If they tone down their service charges then this bank would go from pretty good to excellent.","3590":"I Love My Bank The main reason I love my bank is security. Any time you have any issues the customer service take care of it right away. For example we were on vacation and someone had got our credit card information and tried to purchase some ideas that were irregular. The bank called us for verbal validation. This stopped a potential problem in its tracks. Also we were able to tell them what states we would be traveling in so when charges showed up, they would realize it was indeed us using our account.","3591":"B Of A Losing In Customer Service Just about done with BofA. All they do is raise rates, lower customer service and deny requests for loans and credit. I have recently moved to a local Credit Union where i will probably be moving ALL of my accounts. The only reason to stay with BofA is the sheer number of ATM's but that is increasingly becoming unnecessary due to interexchange agreements between smaller banks. They just don't seem to get it and if they did not have so much in assets, they might be able to see the forest for the trees.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0","2875":"This bank needs to be shut down and given a swift kick in the ash. I could go on and on about how disgusting this bank is (after having been a loyal customer for ver 20+ years) but I already spent more time on this review than I should have. The title says it all.","3592":"Bank Of AMERICA? This is the worst bank you can possibly use!!! STAY AWAY!!!!","3593":"Bank Of America ATM Receipts BofA has a new policy on ATM receipts. They list your \"available balance\", but not your actual account balance. When I complained to a teller about this, I was told that the bank felt that customers were \"getting confused\" about the difference between available and actual balances, so they decided to eliminate the actual account balance. In order to get an accurate balance, you must enter the bank. We depositors are deemed too ignorant to be given this essential piece of information.","3595":"Careless, Slow, Inefficient, And Arrogant Services. Banana Country Banking!! I recently opened a business acount in BoA, but the partners and I decided to change the name(title) of the business, just that, due to being a conflictive name. I did whatever is legal and necessary to accomplish that end. When I received the paper work (certificate of Name Change) from our company's lawyer and the State government with the new name duly approved, I took the papers to the bank to have them change the title of the account accordingly.\u00a0 Little did I know what I was getting into. The employee whom I saw was reluctant to do anything and pretended to speak with someone at higher level on the phone who asked\u00a0 why\u00a0we were changing the name, then proceeded to ask for all kind of documentation -- which I provided. But they wanted originals, even though there were names of State officials and their phone #s to make any consultation. This employee was. They asked for papers I never heard off. I had been with them for over a year and things were going well, but this little and simple request seemed to get them out of their box.\u00a0 Long story short, I proceeded to close the account to which they say , that's OK!!\u00a0 This employee never even tried to keep our business with them -- which, by the way, was not bad at all. I walked out so dissapointed. I was treated so badly that I would not recommend this Bank for anything, they do not seem to care about the needs of the clients. Down BoA!!","3594":"Service With A Crooked Smile. Be very careful with this bank. Dont expect anything other then basic service, like a tv with bunny ears. They do hype up their ratings and various programs, but I would not bank with them unless they were your last option and only option in town.","3596":"Bank Of America (4286) This bank gets zero stars\u00a0from me. They do not seem to understand that banking is not like selling shoes. Just about everytimne I come in, someone pounces on me and with an over solicitous smile and attitude, loudly asks how can they help me. Why would I want to discuss my personal banking business in the middle of a lobby for everyone to hear? Then they are always asking if I have their debit card when I have already handed them my drivers\u00a0license. I DO NOT WANT THE DEBIT CARD, but they keep pressuring me to get it. I have never had a bank where I leave angry half the time but, over silly stuff. If I'm getting cash they loudly count the money, so everyone can hear how much I'm walking out with. They just do not have a clue about bank decorum. The bottom line is that\u00a0this bank is very gimmicky. It\u00a0is constantly bothering\u00a0me about something, but, does nothing for me to speak of. I expect banks to provide interest on my savings and keep my money safe. That's fairly simple, I think. Lasalle Bank was an excellant bank and understood the difference between banking and selling shoes. Pity. Of course, I will be changing banks. \u00a0","3597":"Bank Of America And Consumer Privacy I recently received my BoA statement and included in it was a US Consumer Privacy Notice. Basically BoA can share my personal information with pretty much anyone they want and there is very little I can do to limit this sharing. This likely has a lot to do with the number of telemarketers who phone my home routinely offering some \"service\" that I don't want and don't need, and the amount of junk mail I receive. The realization that I have little privacy with BoA and their new policy of charging three bucks for \"check imaging\" on the monthly statement is enough to make me investigate other banking opportunities, and to visit my local branch and express my distaste. It'll likely do no good. But, if everyone who feels similarly took action, it might make a difference.","3598":"The Bank I Want Bank of America, this is by far the best bank I've been to, all of their personnel are bilingual Spanish-English, so people who are Hispanic always feel welcome. The tellers are super friendly, they always welcome you with a big smile and are are always willing to answer any question you may have. One thing that my kids love about this bank is that they always have lolly pops, yes lolly pops.\u00a0 The ATM is available 24\/7 and you can deposit your check directly there without having to get in line. I love this specially when I'm in a hurry. In the two years I have been with this bank, I have never gotten overcharge for any transactions. So I must say I'm very happy with this bank and they match my savings too. So what more could I want? I got it all at Bank of America.","3599":"The Best Bank In America Bank of America is by far, the best bank in the USA. \u00a0I have referred many friends to this bank.","3600":"BOA Is The Worst Their Massachusetts web site was down January 14, and now all day 3\/1\/11. Look at other Banks.","3601":"Ups And Downs-But Mostly Ups. Before I began banking with Bank of America, I was with a small town bank. The small town bank had way different policies and procedures than those of Bank of America. After becoming familiar with their policies, it was easy to get started. The employees at the banking locations are always helpful and kind. On the other hand, if you have to go through the customer service telephone line, those people aren't always as helpful or kind. Bank of America started allowing customers to deposit money in the form of checks or cash into ATMs, which is a good idea and something I was very excited about. I wanted to call to find out more details before I messed something up. When I talked to the customer service on the phone, the lady informed me it was as simple as inserting the check and the funds would be immediately available. That was NOT the correct information as I latter found out. There is a hold on checks that are over $100. Overall, I have had a positive experience with Bank of America. I believe their only downfall is that they don't communicate things very well to their customers on their new features and full information regarding the features.","3602":"Bank Of America - Pleased I opened a checking and savings account with Bank of America several years ago.\u00a0 I chose Bank of America because they have numerous branches in my city and throughout the United States.\u00a0 After several bad experiences with other banks, I have been pleasantly surprised with Bank of America\u2019s customer service.\u00a0 I recently had fraudulent charges post to my account and Bank of America was very fast and helpful in resolving the matter to my satisfaction.\u00a0 I had to change my debit card and they provided me with a temporary card so that I would not be without one while my permanent card was being sent through the mail.\u00a0 I love being able to make both cash and check deposits through the ATM and the online banking system is excellent.\u00a0 The local branch staff is always friendly and responsive to my questions and concerns.\u00a0 The only negative I have is that I receive many telemarketing calls from Bank of America affiliates offering insurance and other services.\u00a0 I could do without those calls.","3603":"Bad, Bad Bank I would not recommend Bank of America to anyone. \u00a0I, unfortunately, have my mortgage through them and cannot get out of this anytime soon. \u00a0I had a checking\/savings account with them and was so very surprised at how unprofessional they are!! \u00a0First of all, just because you open an account with them does not give them the right to have their telemarketers call you...repeatedly! \u00a0Even after telling them to not contact me, they still call. \u00a0I told them that if I need them, I will contact them. \u00a0I thought that was the way it should work. \u00a0I guess they think otherwise. So, If you would like a bank to call you multiple times in a week concerning nothing, then go ahead and sign up. \u00a0If not, I'd stay away!","3604":"Why Do I Still Bank At Bofa? I joined Bank of America when I was 17 years old, approx 7 years ago. In that time I have been continually disappointed in them. I worked at a credit union for a year and so I understand the processes and procedures of the banking world. My first negative experience occurred when I had set up an automatic payment from my BOA checking account to my BOA credit card. I had it on auto pay and wanted to change it. So I contaced BOA and they instructed me on how to make the change thru my online banking. I did this. The day of the payment comes and they took it out TWICE, resulting in overdrawing my account. Then for every charge that hit, I incurred another $35 OD fee. I had gotten paid direct deposit that next day at midnight and all my money was absorbed for fees, with no time to work things out. I called the 1-800 number and explained my situation and they COULD NOT care less. They show no customer care. This was THEIR fault and they REFUSED to credit me back my OD fees. I went to my local branch and tried pleading my case with the asst manager who said there had been notes placed on my account not to refund the fees. So I withdrew all my money and closed my credit card. I also deposited a check at the drive thru one day recently and it was drawn on BOA. This was also $100. This should have been immidiately credited to my account. But it was placed on hold. When I saw the hold, I called the 1-800 number and they LITERALLY could NOT tell me why it was on hold. He said it was at the discretion of the teller who took the check. Now I could POSSIBLY see placing it on hold if my account had been negative or it I maybe had less than $100. But I had $3,000 in my savings there!!! Bottom line is they are inconsistent with their policies, only care about upselling you to a freakin money market, CD or savings, and they could care less about customer retention. The ONLY reason I still maintain accounts there is because I do like their online & mobile banking. But I have moved most of my money aay from BofA. And I never encourage anyone I know to bank there.. GO TO A CREDIT UNION INSTEAD WHERE THEY ARE FOCUSED ON MEMBER SERVICE AND YOU GETTER BETTER RATES OF RETURNS ON CD'S AND LOWER RATES ON LOANS.","3605":"Best Customer Service! I just want to say that the customer service reps at bank of America are the best!\u00a0 I have been a customer for a few years now, and I have never had a problem calling in with an issue.\u00a0 The customer serice reps are always very helpful, and don't make you feel like it is a bother for them to answer my questions!\u00a0 I highly recommend Bank of America!\u00a0 You can't beat the friendly and helpful associates!","3606":"New BOA Customer Just opened a new checking account and savings account this past week. All of the staff in the bank were very friendly, explained everything about the accounts and took me step by step to decide what was best for me. I ended up getting a great rate on the savings account and a card for the checking account that was good for use the same day. Overall good experience.\u00a0","3607":"Bank Of America (3852) I really like a lot about Bank of America. I like that you can link your savings and checking accounts so that if you overdraft your checking but have it in your savings, it will automatically take from your savings without charging you an overdraft fee. I like that Bill Pay is a free service and it makes it easy to do automatic bill payments or to set them up each month on your own. I like the My Portfolio feature, which allows you to link other bank accounts, loans, and credit cards, so you can take a look at your liabilities and assets all together, as well as determine the categories where most of your spending goes. The one thing I wish I could change is that they have really really REALLY low interest rates for the savings accounts. Other than that, I am happy with Bank of America.","3608":"Horrible Service Hate Bank of America!!! Worst customer service ever and constant mistakes are made. I have to call in every month to resolve a problem that they caused and it is never resolved. I have never in my life dealt with such an incompetent organization. For your own peace of mind go somewhere else.","3609":"Adequate But Not Great. They Look For Ways To Take Advantage Of You. I've had an account with Bank of America ever since they merged with Nations Bank back in 1998. Convenience is the reason I've stayed with them. When I was in school, they had me on a no-fee student account. When I graduated, I kept the account because they didn't (and still do not) charge fees to people with monthly direct deposits. I currently live in NYC and BoA ATMs are everywhere I need them to be.\u00a0 When I leave NYC two years from now, I look forward to switching to a local credit union or other bank. Below is a summary of my expierience with them. Advantages to BoA:\u00a0 They have a good website, and their Portfolio funciton works really well. It's powered by the same software that powers Mint.com, so you can see all of your accounts in one place. This is really convenient. ATMs everywhere. Partnerships with overseas banks. When I was in France last summer, I was able to avoid foreign transaction fees by using my BoA card at BNP Paribas ATMs.\u00a0 They sponsor a promotion where people with BoA cards get free admission to numerous museums, zoos, and aquariums. Disadvantages: Their savings account interest rates and CD rates are lower than elsewhere. I use BoA for day-to-day checking\/cash withdrawals, and keep larger amounts in other banks. Many of my friends have had bad experiences with BoA charging unexpected fees. I haven't run into this because I have direct deposit, but the impression I get is that they view the customers as a resource to be exploited, and that it's gotten worse with the passage of credit reform laws. Customer service is not great. When I lost a card, they were quick to answer that. When I've had other, less urgent problems or questions, they put me on hold for lengthy periods of time.","3613":"What A Great Bank.

I am being charged for my savings acct after having it for almost 6 years for free because I have direct deposit going into it, and now since August 2010 I have been charged a fee of $5.00 per month. When I called to get it removed they said they could credit me for $5.00, but not the $30.00 because they sent me a letter 2 months ago that I did not receive stating I would be charged this fee if I didn't have at least $300 in my account at all times. I never received this letter, but have also been paperless since last year. I then asked to speak to a manager and I was transferred to escalations. Not sure if escalations meant to help or escalate me even more. I was then told by her that I received the letter via email back in July, and if I signed into my account I would find it. I did while on the phone and it was not there, and she said she would resend via mail to me now...so did I get the letter via email back in July or like the first rep said mail 2 months ago? Needless to say, I have never received this letter, and when I asked to have the credit she told me she would have her manager call me back in 72 business hours. when I asked who I could send an escalated letter to she started to give me the address and hung up on me. I can now see why this company is rated in the lowest 5 for customer service. I will take my accounts and leave, and make sure I can tell as many people about this situation. Very disappointed in this company.","3615":"Saga Of The Check Fraud That Was A BOA Error We have a checking and a savings account with BOA. We do our primary banking with another bank; therefore, we use BOA mainly as a savings account. We received a folded postcard from BOA notifying us that $38,000 had been withdrawn from our savings account (there was only $13,000 in the account) the notice stated that we should make a deposit within 5 business days of $25,000 to cover the overdraft and we were being charged a $35 overdraft charge. What bank would allow anyone to withdraw $38,000 from an account with total holdings of $13,000? We didn't remove anything from our savings, in fact on the day this withdrawal occurred we actually deposited funds into our savings account. We called BOA Customer Service and were given to the Check Fraud Division where we waited for 5 minutes listening to obnoxious music and while waiting for a rep from the Check Fraud Division. The representative at first said \"this was a banking error\" then she decided it wasn't and would have to be turned over to a fraud analyst. \u00a0When we asked when we would have resolution she stated the fraud analyst would call us . \u00a0We asked to speak with her manager and were put into a voice mail box and then disconnected. \u00a0We called back and got another Check Fraud Dept rep who asked if the \u00a0first rep had read us a \"disclosure of our rights\". \u00a0The first rep never said that we would be liable for any further withdrawals from the account if we did not freeze the account. We froze the account. We spent the rest of the night on the phone contacting the other financial institutions that we do business with as well as putting a fraud watch on Equifax. \u00a0The next morning we went into the BOA Banking Center Manager who said, after a cursory review of our account activity, \"it didn't happen at this bank\" but upon further investigation she determined that it indeed did happen at the local bank. \u00a0She said it was a 'keying error\". Apparently a customer came in after us and asked to have $38,000 removed from his savings and he asked for a counter check. \u00a0The bank removed $38,000 from our savings and gave him the check. \u00a0 It appears that the \u00a0situation has been resolved (we will believe it when we get a statement showing that our funds have been returned to us and the $35 overdraft charge has been removed). \u00a0We firmly believe had we not persisted with the local Bank Manager BOA would never have found their error. When you are afraid that your identity has \u00a0been stolen and your accounts compromised it is very frightening indeed. Dealing with BOA Check Fraud Division compounds the fear because it is like falling into a black hole - no customer service, no follow-up, no communication, no help at all. The BOA Check Fraud Division clearly exists to serve BOA not the customer. Needless to say we are closing our accounts with BOA","3616":"Poor Treatment By Bank Of America We have been Bank of America customers for over 30 years. \u00a0In 30 years I have never had a check returned NSF until now. \u00a0We have two business accounts and a personal account. \u00a0I wrote a check from my personal account to my business account and deposited it into the ATM at 8:30 in the morning. \u00a0This was all between Bank of America accounts. \u00a0Later that day I wrote a check out of the business account to a third party. \u00a0Little did I know that for the first time ever in my relationship with Bank of America they had put a hold on the deposit at 1 PM that day even though they knew the funds were there because it came from one B of A account to another. \u00a0As a result, the check I wrote to the third party was returned (even though the funds were there) and I was charged $35 for the returned check (even though the funds were there). \u00a0I went to the local branch and all I was told was that they had the right to do that and the hold would have been noted on the ATM receipt. \u00a0I went home and looked at the receipt and it indicated that the funds were deposited that day with no mention of a hold. \u00a0I went back to the branch and spoke to someone else who (while the answer was no different) was at least sympathetic and helpful as opposed to the first person who defiantly stood behind the \"bank rules\" and left us helpless. \u00a0Ultimately, I did get the $35 refunded and a letter given to the third party's bank explaining that the situation was a result of an internal matter at B of A and in no way reflected on us or the third party. \u00a0I have since talked to other B of A employees and no one can believe that a hold Was placed on a deposit between B of A accounts when the funds were there. \u00a0Last week my husband made a deposit to his business account of $20000. \u00a0We needed the deposit to post so we could pay payroll taxes. \u00a0We were told that $5000 was being held until the next banking day and the balance was being held 10 days. \u00a0He also deposited $25000 in checks from Kraft Foods Int'l a nationally known company. \u00a0He has been depositing these checks in these figures weekly ever since he \u00a0opened the account 4 years earlier. \u00a0They also said that they would release only $5000 with the balance to be held for 10 days. \u00a0This was the first time they had ever done that even though we had NEVER had a check returned since we opened the account. \u00a0Since he needed funds to deposit immediately he asked what he could do to get the funds deposited quicker. \u00a0He was told he needed to make a cash deposit although they did not advocate this for safety reasons. \u00a0Left with no choice, my husband had to go withdraw money from another bank and walk $20000 cash into the bank which was located in a less than stellar neighborhood. \u00a0Ny husband went back five days later to see why they still were holding the funds when they should have been cleared by then. \u00a0The telephone agent said that the funds still had not been released by either of the other banks ( Citibank and Chase). \u00a0If that were truly the case then why did they release $5000 on each deposit? \u00a0We feel we are not being told the truth but you can't talk to anybody with any power and customer service savvy. \u00a0When Bank of America was a California company and you could speak with managers in person who had power it was a great bank. \u00a0Now, all I want to do is move all of my accounts to a smaller bank of credit union that works with you instead of against you. \u00a0","3617":"Amongst The Worst Banks Very bad experience with BofA. Customer service is among the worst in the industry. They are clearly looking out for themselves and have little or no concern for their customers. They just don't get it. Don't forget, these guys needed a huge bailout from Uncle Sam. Would never bank with BofA again.","3618":"Timing Of Deposits And Transfers To Accrue Fees Apparently, when the puppet for Bank of America, Obama came into office some laws changed to help BOA pay pack the tarp funds and to become more profitable than ever. BOA now times your deposits and transfers to show last for the day so that any and all transactions that can drive the balance down will do so and more likely resulting in plenty of $35 fees. Why does our country bail out Banks, Insurance, and Auto companies? They are potentially the most profitable types of business but I guess when your president's campaing funding came from these companies it is obviuos. I hope BOA goes out of business.","3619":"Bank Of America, Just Another Letdown.. BOFA was good, back in the day. \u00a0They no longer seem to care for the customers. I had called not long ago to close a checking and one credit card. \u00a0After telling the rep my plans they replied with \"okay they are closed\" and didn't try to save my business. \u00a0I explained that I wanted to be saved but wanted to see if they wanted my business. \u00a0They replied saying that I already was a customer of them and still had a checking\/credit card. I won't forget this, it was extremely disappointing.","3620":"Arrogant Because They Are So Big They truly do not care about you.\u00a0\u00a0 They act as if you are a nobody because they have 20 million other customers.\u00a0 With so many other choices, why go with someone that will eventually bring you trouble!","3621":"The Worst Bank Ever I was referred to open a new checking and saving account with the promotional $10 bonus. However, I never received any cent from the bank.","3622":"Bank Of America - More Than Bad Banking...Harassment And Lies! \u00a0\u00a0 I was very excited to open my new checking and savings accounts through Bank of America. I had just started a job in Tacoma, wa that used B.O.A. as their bank and if I had an account there I could deposit my checks with no fees. For the first few months, I loved B.O.A. I was young and trying to start financially \"building a life\" for myself so I decided to open a credit card through B.O.A. BAD IDEA!!\u00a0 I was hoping to build up good credit as I had no credit record at this point in my life.\u00a0 The account's only fee mentioned was that of a single late fee if the payment was not made on time. This seemed reasonable. Over the next few months, I started to notice charges on my account that were incorrect. Each time I found one, I called B.O.A and, after long debate, they usually corrected these errors. After I charged a hospital bill to my card and the balance was closer to the limit, things got ugly. I always made my payments in full and on time. B.O.A, however, began adding more and more fees for various reasons that had NOT been part of the initial contract. Every time I contacted them, I was given an ear full of stories that NEVER gave any real explanation. If I continued to question them about this they would put me on hold for 20 minutes or longer and then disconnect the line. If this had happened once or twice, I would be willing to assume it was an accident but EVERY time??? Come on, now. I also began noticing false charges to my account supposedly made in places I had never even been. After doing the dance with B.O.A several more times over this, I finally became so fed up that I borrowed the money from a family member and paid off the account. I asked that ALL of my accounts be frozen as I knew no more charges or transactions were due to come through and I would most definitely NOT be banking with Bank of America again. I choze to freeze my accounts because a B.O.A. adviser said it would effect my credit negitively if I just closed the account right away. I confirmed this with other agentcies.\u00a0 The employee I spoke with argued to the best of her ability but finally gave in, accepted the payment and froze my accounts...OR DID SHE?\u00a0 Four months later, I recieved a statement in the mail. Everything looked as though no transactions had been made to my checking or savings accounts. Now, might I remind you these statements are ALWAYS seperate from the credit card statement. However, on this statement, in very small print at the bottom was a notice stating that a charge had been made to my credit card and that I had failed to make my payment on time. Funny...my card had been cut up, my checks burned...how is this possible?\u00a0 I called B.O.A once again for our ritual song and dance of complete disrespect...they informed me that this had been a mistake and that they would \"take care of it right away\". WRONG! EVERY YEAR I do a credit check on my self and EVERY YEAR it shows up that B.O.A closed my account for failure to make payments on time. EVERY YEAR we argue, it gets corrected and we continue on until the next credit check. This year, 2010, I checked my credit and once again my dear friends at B.O.A have reported that my account was closed for failure to pay on time. This year's song and dance lasted for close to an hour with multiple holds and transfers to different departments ending with...care to guess?...a transfer to a closed department that disconnected the line. Thank you, Bank Of America, for the never ending nightmare of harassment and complete disrespect. See you in court.","3623":"There Were Great Times, There Were Worst Times I have been a long time banker at BOA...very long. I had some great experiences with the bank. There were times when I would overdraft and they would take my overdraft charge away at request. They made my credit card payment easy to pay by lowering my interest rate and allowing small payments to be taken out of my account each month. It wasn't until recently that we had problems. I was given a check for $250. I cashed the check and took out $50. Two days later I get a call from BOA and am told without a reason that I am no longer allowed to bank with them. They kicked me out quicker then hobo in the Trump tower. When I called to find out why they said that my the check I had cashed was from a fake account and that I was putting the bank at risk....!!! So there I was with no source of income since they pretty much told me I would have to wait up to 2 weeks to recieve the money I had in my account. Not to mention it was the end of the month meaning bills had to be paid. After I spoke to about 4 rude customer service reps who told me to just go to another bank and that they were sorry because there was nothing they could do I headed over to Chase. Now I am responsible person and my credit is decent so when I was told that I was not able to join Chase I wanted answers. Turned out BOA blacklisted me. I was and still am not able to join any bank for up to FIVE YEARS!!! I even showed proof to them that the check had no connection to me and it was given to me for graphic work I had done for a client. I made a lawsuite out of it and that is still pending because the client is no where to be found...and I am stuck with this mess. BOA may seem great in their commercials and may offer perks here and there but when I say they will leave you high and dry...I mean seriously they will leave you without care in the world and ruin you while they are at it so you don't want to bank with anyone but them...","3624":"Bank Of America Worst Bank in America! I don't have a good thing to say about this bank. I have tried twice to have an account with them and both times promptly pulled my money out and moved to another bank.\u00a0 My last move has been to a Credit Union as I don't have all the hidden fees! They lure you in and aren't good about full disclosure of their fees and how much you must keep in the account to not be charged. It took me 3 months then to get an account online unlocked so that I could even remove the remainder of my money. 2 time burned -- NEVER again!","3625":"Bank Of America -- Can Be A Good Bank I have been banking with BofA for many many years, from Baybank to Bank of Boston, then BofA.\u00a0 I have to admit that, in addition to the amazing numbers of ATMs everywhere, they also offer superb customer service (although I have to say that I am their premier member).\u00a0The bank is a good bank only when situation arises: Recently I made an error on their BillPay and paid twice (at $2,000) to one of my BofA credit card accounts.\u00a0 This error, in turn, created insufficient funding in my savings account.\u00a0 They sent me an e-mail within a day, paid the double amount even though there is insufficint fund in my account, and did not charge me a cent on the overdraft.\u00a0When I called the BofA credit card department, they initiated an ACH and returned the second (double) payment to my savings account within two business days.And this\u00a0was\u00a0just one example of their excellent customer service that I enjoyed over the years!\u00a0 BTW, I also have their fee-free HELOC (with a huge amount),\u00a0at a rate of 2.24%.\u00a0I know that BofA is well-known for their poor customer service and greediness\u00a0in charging customer fees after fees.\u00a0 But this customer has been a long-term loyal customer and continue to be one.\u00a0 So far, I have only good things to say about them.\u00a0","3626":"They're Everywhere Bank Of America Bank of America is everywhere. They began in the west coast in California. They grew in CA, and expanded to Seattle Washington. Later on, they acquired or merged several banks..Seattle-First National Banks, Security Pacific National Banks, Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust, and the biggest merger of NationsBank and Bank of America. Later, they took Robertson Stephens, a securities and investment firm. In 2004, they moved to the eeast coast by purchasing FleetBoston (Fleet Bank). A year later, they announced the purchase of the credit card issuer MBNA and renamed it FIA Card Services. Band of America acquired LaSalle Bank, Contrywide Financial, and Merrill Lynch.They have many many many ATMs everywhere; but yet I always find some place where I need an ATM, and no Bank of America machines. The bad thing: Bank of America charges me $2 if I use a non-Bank of America ATM, and the non-Bank of America ATM charges another $2 (some I've seen $3, and others at $3.50 or $4.00) That's outrageous and should be regulated how it was in the 1980's and 90's.","3627":"Bank Of American Frederick Md the associates are out only for the bottom line - not the customer.\u00a0 No recommendations on how to save money","3628":"BOA Is Wasting Taxpayers' Money Being the flagship bank of US of A (an informal analogy to airline industry), B of A is a fair reprentative of unfrugal Americans. One example is sending me monthly account statement up to 8 months after I closed all my BoA account, even after I made 2 phone calls to BoA Customer Service to stop it. Amazing. If you are not their customers yet, stay away. Consider other banks if you already have accounts. My 2 stars are for their convenient branch locations and being the first bank I have saving account
