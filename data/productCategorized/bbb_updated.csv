I went on their social media and left sent them a message direct private message stating close my account immediately, they responded with this is sensitive information. that was a didn't give me any contact info didn't give me what the next steps were just sensitive information. then I finally set up an appointment to go meet with one of their customer service people I don't know what they're called at the branch, I confirm to this meeting but never showed up and in my notes for them to get prepared for what I was coming in for said close my accounts immediately, they still did not close my account and kept calling me and calling me to try and setup a time to come in and meet them. finally received an email from the lady I was supposed to meet with and she was complaining about me not showing up I stated I have contact you guys several times to close my account you have not I'm now copying in the BBB cuz this is unacceptable practices. my account went negative once already waiting on your team to close it nothing ever happened so now I'm escalating it.

I called the company within a couple of days, and by June 9th, there was a credit on my account for these two charges and a fraud investigation had been started. My card was canceled and a new card was sent out to me. On July 8th, 2020 the credits were reversed. The company sent me a letter telling me that the orders from these services came from my device and that they match my previous account activity. I reached out to ******** who confirmed this was fraud, and they refunded me $*****. I also contacted ******** who confirmed that the transaction was fraud, but all they need is for BOA to reach out to them notifying them that a fraud claim was submitted. The bank doesn't want to contact the vendor for some reason, and therefore I'm stuck with the amount of $*****. I am still in possession of the card that was used, so I was not negligent in any way. Somehow these criminals got a hold of my card, and I don't want to finance their food or lifestyle. Bank of America needs to make this right. They have a $0 liability guarantee which should be applied in this scenario. I get an e-mail from Vernon White who never answers his phone or returns my calls to confirm my complaint with the CFPB. This avoidance is totally unethical and a way for BOA to work around the CFPB. At this point this is impacting my credit score, and it's not okay.

My mother recently passed away and I am working on closing my mom's accounts and it have been a nightmare working with BofA. My mother thought she had everything in order for her passing - she had a living trust listing me as her trustee, she included her safety deposit box in the trust, she listed myself and my brother as the beneficiary of her accounts. 

They waited a month to send us the paperwork from their internal estate department. The paperwork didn't have very much information in it other than to go into a branch AND they included 3 other claims along with my mom for other people's estates. My condolences go out to the families of *************, *****************, and ****************. We emailed the estate services department letting them know they had done this so that they could get the claims out to the correct families. But we don't know if this ever happened since we never got a response. This was our first red flag. 

Next we made an appointment to go into our local branch since that is what the paperwork said. When we got there the bank told us we would have to come back in a week because we have to wait 40 days from passing. It would have been nice if the paperwork included that tidbit. 

So we come back after 40 days and they take all the information from us and tell us that a check will be mailed to us in 3-10 business days. Well it is day 8 and the funds are still in my deceased mother's accounts. AND I have been trying to get a hold of Brenda from North Toluca Lake branch to get us into mom's safety deposit box for 2 weeks. I finally talked to her today and she says we need to fill out a small estate affidavit and have it notarized before we can get to the safety deposit box.... so in the giant packet I received from estate services they didn't think to include this form I would need to fill out and at the 2 bank of america meeting they didn't think that was something they should have told me so to condense all this back and forth. 

Not to mention the amount of people I have to talk to and explain that my mom is dead and all the questions that come with it. This whole experience has been a nightmare. My mom has been gone for 2 months now and bank of america hasn't done anything to help us in closing out her accounts. I really just want to be done with this whole chapter of my life but it's hard when you're waiting on other people/companies to do their jobs.

They gave me temporary credit for the charges and sent me emails explaining the credit.  When my Sept bill arrived the charge was back on my bill. I called BOA and after 90 minuets on hold and being transferred to 3 different departments I spoke to a representative and she said that they had a proof of delivery of the product.  I had not received any notification from BOA re: proof of delivery.  I ask for a copy to be emailed and she said she could not email me a copy.

30,30,Jennifer C,09/03/2020,1,"[<div class=""MuiTypography-root Text-sc-12c66pm-0 fgbKlJ MuiTypography-body2"">BACK OF AMERICA DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS AT ALL. 

I opened an account with Bank of America when I was 18; I'm now 40, so I've been a very loyal customer for over 20 years. In that time, I have never once complained, reported any issues, etc.. However, I was recently a victim of fraud when someone online was able to access my accounts, and long story short, they stole over $5,000 from my Bank Of America checking account. I saw this immediately, and was physically at my nearest branch less than 30 minutes after it happened, and had already called in to report it as well. The money taken from my account was sent to an unknown person via Zelle and Cash App. Bank of America promotes Zelle on their site, and has a relationship with them, so I hoped they would be able to at least stop those transactions from posting since all of the transactions were still in pending status. They did nothing to stop the transactions, and instead told me that they need them to fully process before they can do anything. WHAT?!?! That makes no sense to me at all, but I thought, 'OK, this is their process. They know what they're doing.' I now know that's not the case. 

When I sat down with the bank rep, I was shaking and in tears. I couldn't believe this was happening! I just bought a house, and have a new mortgage to pay, but I was assured that Bank Of America covers you 100% against fraud. FALSE! If you read the fine print, they don't cover you at all against cyber attacks such as this. The woman contacted the fraud department on the phone, and as I sat in that office, I continued receiving texts showing money being pulled from my account. She saw this, and reported it to the person on the phone. I provided them with all of the necessary info, and after freezing/closing my accounts and opening new ones, I left with high hopes of getting my money back once they investigated.

I was told the investigations (there was one for Zelle and another for Cash app) could take up to 90 days. I reported this fraud on August 24th; just 9 days later, I receive an email stating the Cash app investigation was closed. They had determined that I would NOT be getting that money back. I went straight to the local branch, looking for an explanation, as the email gave no details of their reasoning. They again called the fraud department, and the man on the phone essentially called me a liar. He said that with fraud, they would NORMALLY see more transaction attempts after the account is frozen/closed, but since they didn't see this happening, it MUST be fraud on my part; they must have KNOWN the account was frozen! I explained to him that they did in fact make another attempt and Cash app declined it because they apparently recognized it as being suspicious. I had proof of this, which I provided to the bank rep to submit. I understand that many things tend to follow patterns, but to tell me my money is just gone simply because something out of what they consider the norm took place, I was devastated. Did they even look at anything else? Did they take into consideration that I was there within minutes of this happening, literally begging them to do whatever they could to stop those from fully processing? Did they look at the fact that the Bank Of America rep saw the texts coming through on my phone stating money was still being taken from my account? Does the fact that I have more money in there now than I have in my 20 loyal years with them not tell them anything? If I were going to commit fraud, wouldn't I have tried that when I only had a few hundred in my account and was struggling? No, they don't care about any of that. All they look for is ANY reason to deny your claim, and to call you a liar and a thief. 

They have re-opened that investigation in light of some additional things I was able to supply (which I think should have been asked for on day 1), and I am currently waiting for the results of both, but those high hopes I had at the beginning are gone. I have zero faith in this bank to actually look at everything I've submitted, and to try to understand how it feels to have your hard earned money just taken from you. At this point, I've reported this to my local police department, and have spent countless hours on the phone with anyone who will listen. Even the officer that took my report said, 'I can't believe Bank Of America isn't doing anything more to help you'. He told me that he wasn't trying to give me financial advice, but that he'd never do business with them again if he were me. Yes, officer, I would say you're 100% correct on that. 

Ultimately, being a ""valued"" platinum rewards customer, and being with this institution for over 20 years doesn't mean squat to them. I'm not a millionaire, but I do have a decent amount of money in my accounts. They've certainly made much more in interest off my money than was stolen from me, but that also doesn't matter.

I do hope that the results of that new investigation will be different, and that I'll receive good news on the Zelle transactions, but I'm not confident in this at all. I haven't pulled my money out yet because I feel like they're definitely not going to try to help me if they have nothing to gain from it. I will absolutely be taking my business elsewhere though if they come back with the same response. This means spending several more hours opening a new account with another bank, going through every bill I pay with my bank account one at a time to cancel autopays and set up new ones, and contacting my employer once again to have them change my direct deposit information. It's a huge inconvenience, but I don't feel safe with Bank Of America, and I no longer trust them. 

If anyone has taken the time to read this entire review, I urge you to take your business and your money elsewhere. Find a smaller bank/credit union that treats you with respect, and actually sees you as a human being, because I would never want anyone to feel like I do now. I feel helpless and defeated. Bank Of America, I wish you would treat others as you would have them treat you, but that's clearly asking too much. 

In the end, Bank Of America is too big to care about one little customer like me (or you!). We're just a bank account number to them, a source of interest for them to profit from, and nothing more. </div>]",,,bbb.org,mortgage

In March 2020, we received notification from our town that we were delinquent on our sewer tax from the previous year. This didn't make sense, as we have an escrow account for our mortgage; it is the bank's responsibility to pay ALL city taxes, and BofA makes a nice fee from us to ensure timely payment from our escrow account. My wife and I said, ""What the heck do we have an escrow account for if the bank can't even pay your taxes on time?"" We contacted a BofA representative, described our case, and even sent a lengthy email to her describing their mistake. After our call, WE NEVER HEARD FROM THE WOMAN AGAIN, she repeatedly ignored subsequent communications.

Now, here we are in August 2020, and BofA is 'upgrading' their mortgage website. The upgrade has been nothing short of a disaster. We noticed an egregious error on our most recent mortgage statement where the bank was charging over $8k for a 'county tax'. County tax?? Where we live, our taxes go to the CITY,there is no 'county tax'

After a 90 minute wait to speak with a customer support representative, I was told that the new BofA mortgage 'upgrade' had been a huge source of issues, thousands of other customers have seen similar erroneous/inaccurate charges to their account. The representative was brand new to the job, and the system is new, so he put me on hold 3 more times. I was then transferred to a more experienced rep, who again put me on hold, and then shortly after terminated the call. He hung up on me!

We have been customers with BofA for 20 years; I have a mortgage through them in the mid 6 figure range. I have never felt so neglected as a customer after this experience. 2 hour wait, and then hung up on. When time and conditions permit, we will be moving ALL of our mortgage and cash accounts out of BofA. We don't feel comfortable dealing with an institution that has such awful customer service, NOT to mention the privacy and data security concerns of this 'system upgrade'; it seems to me charges from one customer's mortgage are being applied to another customer's account!

My husband has been a customer since 2005, and we've only once redeemed our points earned through your credit card rewards program. In Nov 2019, we rented a car for our wedding anniversary for the posted amount on your travel rewards site and had a $0 balance remaining. We have documentation that proves that. Five months later, in March 2020, we received a bill saying that we owed BoA $317 more due to what we've now been told is an issue between Expedia, Enterprise and BoA. BoA appears to have posted the wrong amount on the car rental price and is trying to shove the excess bill on us instead of paying Expedia due to BoA's error -- essentially charging us $550 for a 2-day car rental, a price we'd never have agreed to had we known. We've filed complaints repeatedly and called all parties. My husband has been on the phone with BoA intermittently since we received that bill, literally spending DAYS on your customer service line by phone only to have reps pass the buck and transfer him between lines. The reps who have actually been helpful aren't enabled to make refunds on their own and have to refer us to the travel center, who is apparently horrendously incompetent. We were given direct phone lines and email addresses to reach out to, only to find a week later that the phone numbers have been redirected and no one responds to email. Four months after that bill was issued, BofA says they've arranged for Enterprise to refund the amount charged; that was due to be posted within 10 business days. It's now been 16 days and BofA has completely gone silent.

We have NEVER made a late payment after 15 years of being a customer. As of now, it appears we're going to need to just count our $317 as lost and cancel our card. I have never been so lost as to who to turn to for help within a company. I'm very disheartened to hear this is how BofA treats its customers and will be making sure friends and family know that.

The bank employee pretty much gave him the run-around and said that there was nothing that he could do for him since he was not an account holder with them. But that he could use the check as a deposit in order to open up an account. All that the teller had to do was go on his computer to verify that the funds were in Mass Mutual's account then issue him a cashier's check for remaining total (minus check cashing and cashier's check fees). So bottom line was this: if you are not an account holder at BOA, they will not cash a check for you even if the check issuer is a BOA account holder BUT if you open an account with them then they will go through the motions of verifying funds for the check. 
As for the check, we went to our own bank and had no problems. Our banking teller called BOA and verified that funds were available, deposited the check into our account, issued us a portion of it up front and the rest would be available the next business day.

When asked why I was told there were no funds in the account and why I was not told to expect these during my initial complaint, I was told it is our Policy.   YOUR POLICY!!!   It is bordering on illegal activity.  Why would you not tell someone that they would get cashiers checks from the bank to discard them on the initial call.

That is fine, I asked just don't charge him anymore. I was dumbfounded to see they charged him again another $5 a week after I went in. He is a child this is supposed to be a free account.

I recently contacted Bank of America to confirm that my two (2) credit card accounts would be subject to payment suspension during the pendency of the Coronavirus crisis. Bank of America initially confirmed that both of my credit cards would be subject to payment suspension and that neither account would accrue interest until May 2020. In fact, when I spoke with the representative from Bank of America in March 2020, she reversed a recently accrued interest charge on one of my credit accounts.

Today, I received an update on one of my credit accounts with Bank of America indicating that I had been charged interest on my pending balance. I immediately called Bank of America to have the charge reversed, believing that the interest accrual had been a mistake. When I spoke with Bank of America, they indicated that although my payments would be suspended until May 2020, my accounts would still accrue interest in any unpaid balances. This is obviously not what I had been told or agreed to in March, nor is it consistent with what the federal government has ordered. Bank of America would only offer to waive late payment fees (despite the fact that I make my credit card payments timely every month and have for years). The representatives from Bank of America also advised me this morning that it is ""not yet their policy"" to waive interest on credit card accounts, despite the fact that the federal government has ordered it to be so.</div>, <div class=""MuiTypography-root Text-sc-12c66pm-0 fgbKlJ MuiTypography-body2"">Thank you for sharing your experience.

I cross-referenced the charge timestamps with BoFA's ranking of them, and found that there was no correspondence between the time I was actually charged and the order of the transactions in the statement. 

This ultimately meant that I had to pay the maximum $140 in overdraft fees even though I should have only paid one, in theory ""just"" $35. A single large transaction (recurring bill) was placed days after 3 ~$10 charges IN REALITY, yet it appeared as if I made the large transaction and then kept making smaller ones with a negative balance on their system.

How very lucrative for BoFA! It's so brilliantly devious that I'm almost sad to withdraw all of my money (I was a single day away from avoiding all of these shenanigans with the deposit of my paycheck) and enroll in a new bank immediately.

Now, in time of need, we cannot even count on our bank, that we have been loyal to all these years, to help us apply for the PPP loan, simply because we never previously had a need for a business line of credit?

What are we left to do here? We are in dire need of this loan, as our business and personal livelihood is now in immediate jeopardy. 

Out of desperation, we immediately contacted other major banks such as Chase Bank and CitiBank to find out if we can apply with them, hoping that since we have personal credit  lines with them we could somehow qualify, BUT were told that because we do not have a business checking account with them we do not qualify. 

These other banks, such as***************** have basic requirements to apply for this PPP loans- a business checking account would suffice.

 It just so happens to be that we do seemingly wrongfully chose to our long-time banking with Bank of America, that has more stringent criteria to apply, in this time of need!

It is a government loan, simply funded through BofA, it should be unlawful this bank put such requirements, to apply for it. 

In reading other reviews, it looks like many of us are dealing with the same issue here. We need to stand together and voice our concerns. All, please contact Governor Newsom's office website, White House website and/or local media websites via contact us forms to express your concerns. Let's make this a problem enough, to produce change!

These requirements MUST  change, before many business owners, banking with this unethical bank, go under.

I reluctantly had no choice. 
Cometh, Mid - Mar, someone siphoned around $2900 from the new card. I was like... What on Earth.
I called the bank. The transactions were in Processing... Still I was told, I have to wait for 90 days. Then my regular payments started bouncing, I was told for hardship we will give you Credit. After 2 days I called them back. They told me to bugger off as they will take 10 days to complete the investigation.
I asked them why didnt they block the transactions when I called them. The answer was we have to Process all transactions!
Its weird... Now I am waiting till March 27 to get my own money back and payoff overdraft fees. I had enough of these guys. I am not sure if a recourse is available, but if there is I will pursue every inch of it.

On ******** - I was fully approved for a bank loan for a car and received an email to call and finalize my details. The day my car arrived, 14 days after the initial approval, I called B of A to finalize my details.

They asked for my social oh, they asked for my address, they asked for my birthday. Said thank you. Then... She asked me if I had dual residency in two residences. I said no. She said okay we are declining your application because we cannot verify your address in our third party system. I asked her if there was another way to verify, she said no. I asked if the address in their system was my previous address, and she verified that it was. I asked if I could have the name of the system they were using, she said no. I told her the system they were using has outdated information, I then asked how long it takes for information to update. She said she didn't know. It's been 3 months since I changed my address, actually closer to about a 100-105 days. 

I asked to speak with a supervisor - they take 2 days to call you back if at all. There's no way to dispute a declined application, or incorrect information, or give them updated information, nor is there a way to contact their third party system and make sure that they're providing correct information.

when I told the woman on the phone that she was being rude and not providing me any method of resolution, she told me she was sorry that I felt that way.

America is a multi billion trillion dollar company, I cannot believe that they think that going cheap on a third-party verification system is the right way to do business.

142,142,alexandria q,01/06/2020,1,"[<div class=""MuiTypography-root Text-sc-12c66pm-0 fgbKlJ MuiTypography-body2"">I remember being young and naive, opening up my first debit card with Bank of America as a teenager. Excited as all get out. I've been with Bank of America for a long time--about 14 years. My parents have been with Bank of America for over 30, before it was even called that (they said it had a different name).

 

Growing up I was taught to trust adults, to believe what people say. As I have gotten older, my upbringing influenced my decision-making.

 

Last year, I opened up my first Business Checking account with Bank of America as well as an Account that I was told could earn my business Travel Awards. The idea of working my tail off and fighting to make my business a success, and feeling like my bank had my back felt like the true American Dream. I was going to make it happen. If I failed, I would try harder.

 

Late last year, a teller at a gas station intentionally did not give me back my card. She swiped it for the person behind me, and he stole it. I wasn't aware I didn't have it till I left, going to the bank to deposit checks. 

 

Within 10 minutes, I realized I didn't have it. It was too late. I had left my phone at home, and it took an eternity to get through Bank of America's automated system to get to an actual human being to freeze my card. By then, quite a sum had been spent. 

 

But Bank of America had me. The lady was calm and sweet on the phone as I sobbed. She was reassuring. 

 

The money was back within my account as a credit and a temporary card issued as well as a permanent within days. An investigation was opened in my county. I was so happy that Bank of America was willing to work with me to get my hard earned money back. I worked with them and the police as much as I could to track the person who stole my card down (who happened to be part of a crime ring, of course). 

 

Turns out justice isn't so just. I won't go into that part.

 

I budget my money on another app not connected to Bank of America, as theirs is inadequate for my needs. I keep receipts and log all my purchases to the ""T."" Routinely, I manually log and track and compute things by hand with calculator.

 

Up until my card got stolen, all my numbers matched. 

 

Afterward, money started to ""magically"" disappear from my account. I thought I was losing my mind. I spent countless hours rechecking my calculations, only to continue to get higher numbers in my accounts (I have multiple accounts). I went to Bank of America reps for help, only for them to tell me that it must have been a problem with my numbers or algorithms in the app. I believed them. God, why did I believe them?

 

By the end of November, I ended up have a discrepancy of almost $300, close to the amount that was stolen from my credit card. So, did Bank of America really cover me for my loses? Or did they lie to me? 

 

I decided to go to a specialist I trusted, and have her do an audit. I told her in faith, everything. I prayed. The audit started. 

 

Bank of America closed it within days and gave me no details. 

 

I was too overwhelmed to do anything. I just quit. I just let them have it at that point, praying to the heavens that this wouldn't happen again. I logged the huge account balance deficit, and fought my way through the hectic holidays.

 

Fast forward to yesterday. Minding my business, doing my business, I was manually logging bills again by hand and in the app. Everything matched. I breathed a massive sigh of relief and was about to go about my day.

 

And it happened. RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES. 

 

I watched as I switched screens in my banking app and my account balance dropped $30. Like. MAGIC. INSTANTLY. No transactions were made. No pending transactions. No transfers. NO-THING. 

 

I almost went nuts. Then you know what I realized?

 

A trillion dollar corporation cares less about you. I mean *laughs*, look at these automated responses on this page!! It's pathetic! All about appearance but it comes off as curt. They'll do what it takes to keep you and your money, even if it means lying--a crusty corrupt capitalistic corporation at its best.

 

*hand clap* I have to give it to you though... Well done Bank of America! You made it to the top! And if it isn't obvious to anyone who reads this review how you did it (and trust me it wasn't completely honest business practices) my God are they blind like I was. Almost all top dogs will always prey upon and sacrifice the weak. 

 

Power. At all cost. Money. At all costs. 

 

Business can be a beautiful thing if you keep in mind that people are behind it and a business works for people, not for the betterment of itself. A business should not be, and never ever should be a separate entity.

Overall, my experience with them as a creditor has been typical, save for one aspect: their poor customer service when calling in. I was prompted to close my checking and savings accounts with them due to this issue, as the bank simply was unwilling to stand by me as a customer when I disputed a charge that I should have been compensated for based on the circumstances, and this very same issue with their service standards is now prompting me to cut all three of my cards and never use the accounts again. All I wanted done was to have all three cards on a matching billing cycle to make payments easier for me. For some strange reason, their customer service reps refused to do so. I called on various occasions during the year about it and received the same poor result-the reps refused to update my billing cycle on just one card. When I kept persisting as to why, the latest rep simply transferred me to the collections department, as if I had or was going to pay late, though the bill was not even close to being due and would assuredly be paid in full! This kind of assumption is simply sad and shows how they feel about the majority of their account holders-delinquencies waiting to happen. I promptly explained this is not a collections matter and was given more of the same run around by two other reps transferring me here and there, doing basically nothing to really solve the issue nor explaining the reasons behind why the request could not be satisfied in any way that could be described as excellent service, something I've too often heard their reps describe as their aim. Sadly, this excellent service is just puff and smoke, a dream. Asking for a simple billing cycle change is such a basic and elementary request.

Bank of America (BoA) staff mishandled and miscommunicated handlings of reimbursement of $10k+ owed to me. This involved 4 customer service representatives, two customer service managers and an AVP of customer service.

I requested reimbursement of funds mid November. I was told that I would have it within 2-5 business days to the bank account of my choosing.

9 days passed and the fund were not deposited in the designated bank account. I contact BoA and the customer service representative mentioned that I would not have it for two billing cycles because the first representative processed it incorrectly. I requested that it be fixed, as I needed fund for bills. They enrolled a manager, who then said it would be corrected and I would be have funds in 48 hours.

2 days later the funds were shown to be removed from BOA and sent somewhere but it was not in the designated bank account. I contacted the other bank a day later and they confirmed that BoA sent nothing. I emailed and called the customer service manager that was handling the matter and asked for him to confirm it went to the designated account and when I will have it. He said I should have it.

3 more days passed, I still did not have my funds from BoA in my designated bank account. I contact the manager again and he said he would look into it and ask the escalation team and get back to me but he would be able to tell me that day. So I called the customer service number and got another customer service representative and their manager to look into where my money went. They said it went to the designated account and should be there in 3 days, that the other manager did not expedite the reimbursement.

3 more days pass (20 days from my original request) and I still do not have my $10k+. I keep emailing and calling the customer service manager that was originally supposed to resolve it. After several attempts he finally emails me back and says that he's still waiting to hear from the escalation team. I ask him if he has tried to call that team, or if there is a supervisor he can get help from - I got no response.

At this point my other creditor's bills are starting to bounce. I decided to call the customer service number again because the manager was not providing the information I needed and had no sense of urgency on the matter.

Once I got a hold of another customer service representative, I explained the situation and that I had already filed 2 complaints, and that I need to speak with someone higher than the customer service manager that was not acting effectively. She went to send me right back to that same manager. I pushed to talk with someone higher. 

I finally got an AVP on the line, which told me that my funds left their bank 2 days after my second request, and was sent to a creditor other than the designated bank that BoA kept telling me on a recorded line and via email that my money would go to and went to. He said that I'd need to contact the creditor to get my funds back and that BoA did make some errors and it was a coaching opportunity for them. But basically, now they can't help me - I have to contact the creditor?!?

I look at the creditor account and no payment for $10k+ is made to my account. I call the creditor and they could not locate it off the bat. The money is in limbo. I have opened a service investigation ticket with the creditor and will not hear back for at least 2 days. In the meantime, steps I took to clean up my credit are now ruining my credit due to BoA's mis-handling/miscommunication, etc. 

This is more than a ""coaching opportunity"" for BoA. I have worked in finance for 20+ years (Credit Unions, Banks and Mortgage) and this is unacceptable.

The appointment was to deliver my co-worker's donations to an animal shelter, and it was closing. 


I held for about 15 -20- minutes and I was told they were personal accounts and couldn't help me and transferred me to business customer service. The menu referenced ACH and nothing else, so I held, as I was driving. This wait was also about 20 minutes. This department verified my identity, told me they only handle back end ACH claims and said they would transfer me to business customer service. I asked if I would have to go through the same process of verifying identity (I was driving, so difficult) and they said I would not, and that I would not have to verify identity, and would be directly transferred.


Of course, this did not happen. After a 40 minute wait, someone came on the line, supposedly to help. But, at this point, I just arrived at the shelter appointment. I asked them to hold, because I could not start over again.


So, this person asked for my identify to be verified again, heard the story AGAIN, and told me they would submit the claim and a complaint on my behalf. Jeannie gave me the service request #: REMOVED BY BBB and told me to call REMOVED BY BBB to follow up on both the deposit and the card. She said these claims are expedited and taken seriously. She said she could re-issue the card, but there is a $15 fee that I would just need to call and dispute. Really? No thanks. I have spent more time on BoA's faulty equipment and incompetent personnel than on my own business today.

December 3


This morning, I received an email that there is a message on my account. This message said the issue was closed, but no detail. It said to call ************** for details. I called. They said they could not help with this type of claim. I have been on hold now for 17 minutes to REMOVED BY BBB. Seriously?!?!?!


I realize BoA is a large organization and does not care at all about my business, but this is truly unbelievable. Also, that ATM is out of commission about 50% of the time and should be replaced. I cannot wait to switch to another bank as soon as I have time. I have 2 personal accounts, one for 30 years) and two business accounts that process 2.5M a year, and I realize that is small to BoA, and that no one there cares. But I am a small, woman-owned business and 24 people count on these deposits to be paid.


Still on the phone after 36 minutes and have been told that no claim was filed. **** 


Was told the card would be re-issued and that the checks would be investigated within the next few days. I said that was unacceptable and needed to happen NOW. Supposedly, it is now expedited again and I should hear back. Can't believe I actually had to ask for it to be expedited. That should have been offered up front.


I said I don't believe I will hear back and was given the deposit specialist # to call if I don't. REMOVED BY BBB We'll see. I don't have high hopes.


If I ran my business the BoA does, I would be out of business. And, I may be driven out of business by BoA not depositing my checks and taking up 5 hours of my time for a machine that they should not even have in operation. About 50-75% of the time, when I go to that location, there is a repairman working on the ATM. I have tried going into the banking center and have been told to go the machine as it is faster and in a condescending way, told how to use the machine. 


So, BoA, do you have a recommendation for a good bank that cares about their small, women-owned businesses?

December 4
Well, here we are the next day, and still no resolution, as promised.  I am on a 29-minute hold with the deposit specialist line: REMOVED BY BBB.
Love that BoA advertises that they help women-owned business.  What a joke.

158,158,Dorothy D,12/02/2019,1,"[<div class=""MuiTypography-root Text-sc-12c66pm-0 fgbKlJ MuiTypography-body2"">I am 77 years old I have been with the Bank of America for 18 years. I am disabled and I am also on a fixed income. I receive a SSI check ($172.00 on the first) and and a Social Security disability check ($689.00 on the third). This is the only money that I receive once a month and this is my lively hood how I survive eat and pay my bills with this money. About 3 months ago I noticed that my account would always mysteriously overdraft at first I thought that it was just be not keeping track of my money until I watched my spending very closely and it still would overdraft. I called the bank a young lady took a look at my account and noticed that *Amazon Prime* would cause my account to overdraft and had been doing so for almost 7 months. She got me over to the dispute department I waited on hold for an hour and a half and a man picked up I repeated to him the problem and he said in a smart way ""you don't have an amazon account"" as if I were lying I again told him no I am 77 years old I have no clue what Amazon prime is he then said well I am going to get Amazon on the line and I need to hear them say it I said fine he then called Amazon on the other line and we waited about 15 mins for them to get on the line needless to say they could not find an account with my name they asked me a phone number and email address neither had worked. Someone had opened an account fraudulently with my bank card information I then asked Bank of Americas representative did he hear that and what was the next step. He however was not on the line he had transferred me over to Amazon and had hung up I was in disbelief how unprofessional and mean he was I then called bank of America back and was on hold yet another hour and a half. This time I spoke with a young lady she was very nice gave me numbers and let me know I had been out of $202 including $12.99 every month for 6 months and $124.00 in overdraft fees and assured me that she let me know she would dispute these transactions for me and would get me my funds back to me I was thankful. I was giving my money back and went on with life as I knew. On 11/26 I got a letter in the mail that said these charges where in fact authorized and that they would deduct $90.93 from my account on 11/29 including any other transactions associated with this dispute I couldn't believe that they told me I opened this account when I in fact did not and was sure I ""proved"" that to them by calling Amazon. I then immediately called them and let them know again that they were NOT authorized the lady on the phone let me know that she would reopen the case and everything would be fine. On 12/1 I called to check my balance because my nurse would be coming to take me the grocery store and my account was negative -$17.32. Bank of America had token my SSI (which by the way is against the law to be touched) they had take $12.99 6 times had $105.00 on hold $2.50 (overdraft fees) I was so hurt and confused I called the bank on 11/30 and a man had let me know that the $12.99 transactions would take some time I would have to talk to the dispute department on Monday 12/2
But I would get my money back today 12/2. I woke up this morning no money still negative I called the bank again dispute department she was very rude and told me that it would take 45 days and there was nothing that they could do about it I let them know that I was 77years old on disability and I have been a customer for almost 2 decades still nothing still I let them know these transaction where in fact unauthorized and I shouldn't having nothing left to survive with after I pay bills still 45 days I then asked to speak with supervisor she was very snotty and let me know that he would tell me the same thing in fact he did till me the same thing but let me know it could go quicker if they wanted but nothing more the fact that I have been with them so long I should be treated with more dignity and respect nothing he then told me that he would transfer me to a specialist and they could help me on the overdraft fee portion I said fine he then transferred me and the operator told me that my call could not be completed and hung up. I don't know what else to do from here I will be reaching out for legal help they have token my whole Social Security check and is holding it hostage for something I did not authorize. I asked my granddaughter to write this and post it everywhere and keep it up until they fix this.

My personal bank account had more than enough funds for the payment and again after calling my bank they said no such attempt from Bank of America was made for the payment. 

I was told by Bank of America there was nothing they would be willing to do about the fee. They refused to take any blame or investigate why their website and iPhone app were saying payments were being accepted but then being reversed. I have no recourse of action because my personal bank has no record of the payment being attempted to be deducted from my bank account and Bank of America refuses to tell my anything other than they will charge me a fee.

The second complication was when I was at a store purchasing something with my personal debit card (a different account) and my card was declined. I saw that there was an unauthorized transaction on my account, which led to my personal account being overdraft, so I called the fraud department.

I was later informed that my Business Checking had gone into overdraft--which I was not aware of. Then they decided (WITHOUT INFORMING ME OR ASKING ME IF I'D LIKE TO MAKE PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS) to take money from my PERSONAL account to satisfy my BUSINESS account which completely rendered both accounts useless to me. 

I found it completely unacceptable that they would make such a decision without informing the customer. I have a right to know and plan.

Needless to say im pissed.  They have sent me 15 emails about my account like ATM card has been mailed and thanks for opening your account.  But the one that says there is an issue they mail.  Why?  Then I call they give me the run around telling me in a few days when my account is finalized they will mail me a check.  I'm like are you freaking kidding me.  And yes I'm on the phone to a supervisor that took 45 mins to get on the phone.  My biggest issues are I have way more that there 25.00 min in the account, they couldn't send an email and its going to take another week to get my money.  I don't know about you guys but I have bills.  To top it off they say this... We want you to go inside and open an account.  I was like do I get my money now..

I opened the account back in April however, did not receive the redemption email until early September. The wait time was longer than originally stated. Afterwards, I was eager to redeem my iPad. After receiving the iPad, I opened the box to find out it was a refurbished, not in brand new condition with Bank of America's branch apps preset on it. I was very displeased with believing that I signed up for a brand new iPad however, received a used one that had marks on it. I called Bank of America's customer service to request a replacement. I was given the return label and shipped the iPad back. The associate on the phone told me that once they received the iPad they would ship out the new iPad within 3-5 business days. However, I waited weeks yet there was no shipping confirmation from Bank of America in regards to the new iPad. I had to call their customer service line multiple times, and followed up myself in regards to the tracking for the new iPad. I waited over a month since they received the refurbished iPad to receive the new tracking. However, once again they sent me another refurbished iPad again. If Bank of America is unable to provide a brand new iPad then they should not be running this promotion stating that the client will be given a brand new item. This can easily be seen as a scam against the consumer having them open checking accounts so they can reach their quotas. If I can provide a 0 stars for the level of satisfaction I would.

They requested my debit card to make the deposit, so my actual money is linked to this checking account. One day after signing up, I got an email saying I had changed my Bank of America passcode. I HADN'T. So naturally, I was alarmed.

I called Bank of America and talked to four different representatives before a very hateful person came on the phone and basically demanded that I go to the nearest Bank of America branch (2 hours from me, so a 4 hour drive total) and verify my identity with two forms of ID. First of all, you allowed a complete stranger to change my passcode this morning! That's not MY fault. It's your security's fault. So it's a simple matter of, I am a severely disabled woman who cannot make this four hour journey to verify my identity. I offered to send identity through mail. She very curtly explained that they can't accept forms by mail. No problem: CLOSE MY ACCOUNT.

She refused to close the account and still, even after hearing that I am severely disabled and unable to go in person to verify my identity, refused to close the account. That's terrifying. It's a simple matter of because of your allowing someone to change my passcode, someone who wasn't me, now you're saying that I have to drive 4 hours so that I can do business with you? NO THANKS. 

I plan to seek legal advice on how to get this account closed. I have complete and total control over my financial life. I don't have to do business with you if I don't want. I answered question after question verifying my identity. I offered to do photo IDs through mail. If you don't want to accept that, that's fine, but I have a right to close my account! And the scariest part is, you allowed someone who ISN'T ME to change the passcode on me, but you're punishing someone who had planned to do banking with you by demanding they drive four hours just to get your terrifying banking services.

Just to review here: One day in Bank of America had already had someone who isn't me change my passcode. One day in. I hadn't even got my debit card or checks yet. Then they demanded I drive for hours and hours just to verify my identity, even though apparently a complete stranger has more of a right to any of my financial information and accounts than I do. Finally, I'm horrified that this bank has my debit card information (I used it to make the initial deposit of $25). I am going to have to get a lawyer to close the account. Absolutely stunned that this bank treated me like a complete criminal for trying to start an account with them, even though these people had my account hacked within 24 hours of signing up for the account. Scary stuff.

This should make me the ideal, responsible, trustworthy client. On August 23, 2019 I deposited a $20,000 check from ***** bank into my business account. I had been transferring money into that same ***** account for months for business, however that was the first check I had received from the same account. I asked when the funds would be available and after checking with the manager, the teller told me the funds would be available the next day. They were not. When I called to question when the funds would be available I was told it was being held by ""Risk Management."" They said none of the funds would be available until September 4rd, a full seven business days after the deposit. They said they believed the check would be returned and a letter had been sent to me stating that fact. The check cleared the payor's account and was deducted on August 26th. I waited until August 28th to call the bank again about my funds. I told them the funds from the check in question were removed from the ***** account on August 26th and I would like the hold removed and the funds put into my account. Customer service said no, they didn't have the funds yet and Risk Management would not budge, ""and by law, we can hold funds for as long as 7 to 10 days."" I asked to speak to risk management and was refused, they do not speak to customers!?! You may only communicate through customer service! Yesterday, I finally received the letter from Bank of America and it did in fact say ""A hold was placed on your check because check specific information indicates item may be returned."" I called B of A yet again and told them the check had been paid and asked why I couldn't have my money. They said that just because the money had been deducted from the ***** account didn't mean that B of A had the actual funds from the check yet and no I couldn't have the money until September 3rd, again repeating the mantra ""and by law, we can hold funds for as long as 7 to 10 days."" Frustrated, I called my daughter-in-law, a manager for ***** for over 15 years and explained what was going on. She said ""B of A is just jerking you around, of course they have the money."" She suggested I take a copy of the front and back of the check that had cleared along with a screen shot of the account showing the deduction of the check and physically go to the bank, speak with a manager, show them the proof and have them handle it. I went to B of A with proof in hand. They insisted that B of A did not have the funds and went so far as to say that I had no idea how banking works. ""The check clearing and money has to go through the Federal Reserve and they put money in a truck and drive it to the bank."" Really?? In this digital age?? I insisted (as I was told by my daughter-in-law) that when the money is deducted from one bank it goes onto the books of the other bank. They said no, ***** still has the funds and repeated the mantra ""and by law, we can hold funds for as long as 7 to 10 days."" So I went home and called ***** and relayed what B of A said about ***** deducting the funds from their clients account and still holding the money. She said that was untrue, when a check is paid the money is gone from ****** So I called Bank of America again and I was told all of the same nonsense, ""B of A does not have the funds and by law, we can hold funds for as long as 7 to 10 days."" I told her that ""the funds are not magically floating in the air, they are on SOMEONE'S books. I can't use them, the writer of the check can't use them - the money is on B of A's books and I want them in my account."" She insisted they were not on B of A's books so I asked her to send me that in writing. She said no, they had sent me a letter and that was all I would receive. I said, the letter was referencing August 23rd when they in fact didn't have the funds, it's August 29th now and everyone keeps saying that B of A doesn't have the funds and I want that in writing. Again, she refused and told me my funds would be available September 4rd no matter what. Unfortunately, while the law says the banks can hold your funds for 7 to 10 days, doesn't mean they should if their ""worries"" are proved to be unwarranted and the check is shown to be paid.</div>, <div class=""MuiTypography-root Text-sc-12c66pm-0 fgbKlJ MuiTypography-body2"">Thank you for sharing your experience.

About a month ago they began harassing me about a personal checking account I set up for taking people to Israel. BOA personnel set the account up for me about two years ago. I made it as clear as I possible could that this was not a business. I wanted an account separate from my primary checking because of the amount of money people were paying me for the Airlines and Tour company. This year was the first year I actively used the account. About a month after I got back from Israel I begin to get harassing phone calls from BOA in regard to the account. After it was investigated it was learned BOA set the account profile up wrong. A week after getting this worked out I located an email in my junk email notifying me that I had less than 25 dollars in another checking account I had set up for my daughter when she went to college. Without notifying me BOA closed this account without notifying me in advance took control of the funds in the account. After finally getting someone on the phone they stated they could not up date my daughters profile since she was also on the account. Stated they would mail me a check for the monies in the account. 

Bank of America never bother to notify me of the closing of the account and dealing with their customer service is a hit or miss event. Beware of Bank of America. They will close your account without notification and temporarily seize your funds. They have closed a large percentage of their branches and make it very hard to do business with them.</div>, <div class=""MuiTypography-root Text-sc-12c66pm-0 fgbKlJ MuiTypography-body2""> Thank you for sharing your experience.

Some of you may love Bank of America, for you I am happy.

I on the other hand think they are completely and utterly worthless.

After depositing my check this last Friday Saturday I wake up to see if it's cleared, it had.

This morning I wake up to find out they've pulled it back out of my account putting me in the hole quite a bit! So I call to find out what happened as I know on our companies end it's already been removed from the account.
They processed to tell me that because they've never seen me deposit a check from Wells Fargo they decided to protect themselves and put a hold on my check until September 4th which is nearly two weeks from the time I deposited it.
So needless to say the very minute I can close my account and move on to another banking facility that actually knows how to do Banking and treat people right I will do so.

So if you have a Bank of America account be forewarned that when you deposit your check days later they can remove it even after you pay bills and have automatic withdrawals coming out, sure they will refund the $35 transaction fee per bounce but that doesn't change the fact that bills will be late and fees will be assessed by those companies not too sure if they're going to be refunding ** those amounts as well.

Share if you think Bank of America is worthless.</div>, <div class=""MuiTypography-root Text-sc-12c66pm-0 fgbKlJ MuiTypography-body2"">Thank you for sharing your experience.

They pre-approved a client of mines for an amount she didn't qualify for, setting up the client for failure, and loosing her deposit. The loan officer who was handling the file pre approved my client for an amount based on her tax returns and pay statements. She put in an offer, got her offer accepted and went through all the process. Paid for a home inspection, they made her order an appraisal and also made her get an insurance binder for the property. Everything was going smooth until it was a couple of weeks before closing. Then the nightmare and games started. They kept delaying everything, my client and my self was trying to call and email the loan officer daily. He started ignoring everyone and would not provide a concrete answer. My client then reached out to the loan processor who kept giving my client a bunch of excuses. She even said once that the underwriter called out sick and that they won't be able to give my client an answer for a few more days. It's ludicrous that a big bank like BofA has only one underwriter handling all the files. They made my client run around getting paper work that the loan officer never sent to the loan processor. When she sent in the paper work then underwriters would say they can't accept it. My client is an independent contractor and has no employer who could verify her employment and income. I would imagine that a bank would use common sense and look at the tax returns, pay statements to verify a customers employment. It got to the point that the seller of the house refused to sign any extensions because BofA was always taking forever to reply back and give us a concrete answer. We informed them that the house went back on the market and that we were way behind on the deadlines. They didn't care at all, instead of expediting the file they just kept on adding days, weeks of delays. My client sent them a letter they requested and the loan officer told my client it would take up to 5 days to review the letter. Absolutely ridiculous, why would it take 5 days to review a letter? Knowing that the file was way behind. It got to the point that my client started requesting something, either a commitment letter of a letter of denial. The loan processor kept ignoring her request and kept on asking for more paperwork which my client had already sent to them. It's almost like they figured they made a mistake and they were trying to stall things and find a way to deny the loan. After almost 3 weeks they finally decided to deny the loan saying that my client had too much debt which she does not and that they could not verify her income, which was all on paper on her tax returns. My client is so stressed out from this ordeal that she has given up the idea of buying a home and also faces loosing her deposit due to BofA's mistake. I would not wish this type of thing to happen to anyone, thus I would suggest anyone who's thinking about buying a home to stay away from BofA. They will make your life a misery. They are a big corporation which does not care if you end up getting screwed at the end. Try to get pre-approved from lenders which deals with mortgages only, stay away from BofA.

Bank Of America has started a ""get to know your customer"" campaign. unfortunately this campaign may kill their business. 

My account was COMPLETELY FROZEN with both outgoing and incoming payments halted because they ""needed to confirm my contact information was up to date"". Contact information included my name, address, phone number and email. I was NOT alerted by BOA that my account was pending being frozen, nor when they actually froze all my funds. I had to discover my payments and ACH were not incoming or outgoing from other providers (i.e. my employer, Mortgage company, and car loan company). 

Today (8/8/2019) after waiting an hour on hold to understand what was going on, i was told my account was frozen on 8/3/2019. Again, i did NOT receive any communication from BOA (mail, email, phone, online document center,pop-up on my online account etc). In order to ""unfreeze"" my account, i had to verify (all were correct) my contact information. After verifying, the customer service rep told me my funds would not be available until the next day- meaning I do not have access to my money. The ""manager"" who i spoke to said this has been occurring often with their clients, and have had issues daily. WAKE UP CORPORATE OPERATIONS TEAM AT BANK OF AMERICA- THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE FIXED IMMEDIATELY!! 

I now have past due bills, late fees, and risk of negative notes against my credit due to this issue. i was told they will ""mail me a letter saying the account is in good standing"", which then i am responsible for sending to other providers where my account (which has plenty of funds) has bounced.

They don't have humans attempt to notify customers before they drop a bomb on their credit score!

216,216,THEN,08/01/2019,1,"[<div class=""MuiTypography-root Text-sc-12c66pm-0 fgbKlJ MuiTypography-body2"">My husband and I have banked with Bank of America for 20 plus years. We haven't had any major issues until we applied for and began to use our Bank of America credit cards. On the surface it's not a big issue, but the fact that it's on going and the response I am getting from ""customer service""  makes it a PROBLEM... 

This is the only credit card company we have or ever had that you have to call in the get a pay off. I was made aware of this when I paid off my first balance. The very next day I was hit with interest on a zero balance. I call the customer service line and they told me to call in to get a pay off before I pay of the balance each and every time. Well, as inconvenient as that is; having to wait on hold 10 to 20 min to get a pay off, but I digressed. 

The next time I was ready to pay off the balance I called in. as instructed. After about a 15 min wait time to talk to a live person, I told the agent I would like to get my pay off balance. She told me what it was and I immediately paid what she told me to pay. The very next day, I have interest charges on my card (smh). I called in to see why this had occurred. The reason the agent gave me was ""oh, that's just an estimate.""  

OK, let me get this straight: it's just an estimate what I see as my balance online AND it's just an estimate when I do what you tell me do, by calling in to get a PAY OFF?? REALLY?? So now I have wasted approximately an hour of my life having to call in twice just to pay off my balance... This is unacceptable Bank of America! And yes they do have the call back service, but you still have to be on stand by to wait for them to call you back. I'm trying to take away every excuse they can come up with, because these companies are good at making excuses and not so much with coming up with solutions.

The only solution they gave me was to pay off the balance on the due date every time, but something tells me that they would still hit me with interest because it's accrued daily.  Plus depending on the amount I charge, I may not be able to pay off the balance every time. I just don't know how they don't see this as an inconvenience to the consumer or if they even care. They will allow you to file a complaint. When you inquire about a follow up, they tell you that there will be no follow up. UNBELIEVABLE! 

And of course you are not allowed to speak with anyone in the corporate office. I wish we would never opened credit cards with them, because this is RIDICULOUS!! Making something that should be very simple, DIFFICULT!</div>, <div class=""MuiTypography-root Text-sc-12c66pm-0 fgbKlJ MuiTypography-body2"">Thank you for sharing your experience.

I'm now looking for a new bank.  I have been with Bank of America since 2002 and get nothing but run arounds.  Our account got compromised by no fault of our own.  I called they acknowledge it was fraud and we got a new account opened.  Well under the old account I had opened a savings account in which they drafted $25/month from my checking and put it into my savings and this was done do avoid monthly service fees.


We had to go into a branch where we live to get the new account opened which was not a problem.  We asked them at the branch if this would cause any problems with our savings account a the way it was setup to avoid monthly fees and we were assured it would all be moved to the new account and all would function the same.  Come April I check the savings account and see that we are being charged fees and nothing is being drafted.  I call and speak to a representative who advises that she would talk to a supervisor to see what they can do.  After a wait she gets back on and advises that we were grandfathered into the $25/month draft to prevent service fees and that they would fix it and refund the fees.

Now its June, we are still being charged monthly service fees and are now told we must comply with the new rules for the savings account.

Mind you it was never an issue until our checking account got compromised and we had to open a new one.  At this point I have closed the savings account and unless Bank of America contacts me and fixes this putting it back to how it was I will be leaving to another bank where I don't have to worry about the lies.

Apparently, even though you're given the option to credit points toward the balance of your credit card, it doesn't count as an actual payment. The representative says there's a window that pops up stating this...I missed it, so likely, this is one of those super small side notes no one pays attention to. If I had added another step for myself by depositing the money to my bank account first, they say that would have counted...really??? It's the SAME thing. So, over a ""late"" balance of $44 that was actually paid on time through credits that were mine to use, there was an unwillingness to rectify the situation. I have been with BoA for over a decade and brought quite a bit of money to them with high credit card balances in between buying and selling homes multiple times (we flip properties).

Some words of warning on mobile banking (please read)... On 9/11/18 I deposited a check given to me by my old tenant from his ********** account. In May 2019 I received a text from my tenant indicating that the check was redeposited. I checked in my account in Bank of America and with my bookkeeper and the check was not deposited into any of my accounts. It was no where but there was a deduction in my account in the amount of $2000. Bank of America had taken the money out of my account and returned it to my old tenant. I called them and they said ***** told them to and since the check was deposited twice they had to take it. Of course I argued and tried to find out who deposited it. They said the only person who could trace the check was the old tenant. I went to ***** who told me the same thing. I called my old tenant who luckily is a nice guy. He called his bank and they told him they didn't know and he got his money back and that was that. I called the Milford Police Department and kudos to them the officer that came to my office (******) took the information and went to BOA who said they couldn't help and then to *****. ***** said the money was deposited at 2:29 am on 5/7 into a bank account that wasn't mine. The check was made out to me and said ""FOR DEPOSIT ONLY"" on the back. ***** said the hard check took precedence over the mobile always even though it was EXPIRED and not deposited by me or into my account. The only person who could do anything about this was my old tenant who needed to file a fraud investigation that then needed to be investigated and the two of us would sign affidavits. At this date, 6/17 I am still out of $2000. My old tenant awaits paperwork from ***** that was sent in the MAIL. The check I now assume was taken out of my car where I was parked in a NYC parking lot. I usually keep all my checks at the office but this one I opened while travelling last year and it happened to remain in my briefcase.

The reason I am writing this email is that you either don't use mobile banking or write DEPOSITED all over your mobile banking checks after you put them into your account. If this situation happened to someone who was living paycheck to paycheck or did not have any backup they would be in a dire situation. Please SHARE this with everyone you know as I am sure some of them do not shred nor write deposit on their checks. This is not my last post about this because I am going to file a civil action so that it gets some press and so that it doesn't happen to anyone else. SHAME on BOA, ***** and ********* If you know of anyone who had this happen to them please let me know.</div>, <div class=""MuiTypography-root Text-sc-12c66pm-0 fgbKlJ MuiTypography-body2"">Thank you for sharing your experience.

I filed bankrupty on 06/2017. And the bank of America has always harassed me by objecting to what I reported how many payments were past due, which they had reported on the monthly mortgage statement they would send me. They have requested the court to raise my payment several times. And now Carrington has bought my loan but Bank Of America is asking the court permission to foreclose on my home.  Carrington is also playing the same games like a bank of America not giving me credit for the payments I have made and lying to the bankruptcy court that I am 5 months behind from 10/01/2018-05/01/2019 and they have on their statement that all the payments I have made. It really makes me angry how Bank of America is asking the bankruptcy court permission to foreclose on my home! They took $21,000 from me in 2013 when I did a home loan modification and they have lied to my bankruptcy attorney about it making her think I'm lying to try and make her drop my bankruptcy case so they can steal my home from me even though I am making my payments and have on time since 07/01./2017.  They should be punished for asking permission from the bankruptcy court to foreclose on my home, even though I have been making my payments! They don't like that they are getting very little payment from the past due amount! Home ownership is dead in America. Because all mortgage companies want to do is steal your payments you have made and then foreclose on your home. It's like legalizing stealing! And how BOA doesn't apply your payments to your mortgage balance is stealing your money too! There is no true justice for this crime these mortgage companies are doing to home owners! Bank Of America is very greedy and self-centered people! Well, I'm fighting them by sending proof of the payments I have made to them from the very beginning!  Bank of America hates it to the core that I'm fighting! I'm protected under bankruptcy from them foreclosing but them asking the bankruptcy court permission to foreclose on my home, is them not accepting that I am protected to prevent them from wrongful forecloser on my home. It's just another form of harassment from Bank Of America trying to get their way! I'll be asking my lawyer for her to request the judge punish bank of America for lying to the bankruptcy court!

So I go get the checks back from the teller the next day and as instructed I deposited it through the ATM, next day I see the reversal on my account, I called the 800 number and customer service advised me that I needed a 3rd party agreement setup for my account and that would fix the problem.  I now have $70k+ in checks that will not post to my account and are in the mail coming back to me.  I walked into the branch and ask for the branch manager, of course he is at lunch and the assistant comes to help, I explained the situation and he made it look like it was my fault!!! I'm not the banker, they failed to ask questions when I opened the account.  They asked me if I wanted to come back to the branch in 3 days to take care of the form!!!!!

To whom it may concern, 
I recently had to interact with your claims department / customer service department.  It has bee far from pleasant experience.  
I have had a Bank of America Auto loan Since 2015 and on 9/13/2018 was rear ended while sitting a light and my vehicle was totaled.  To make a long story short, I was told by Allstate on October 11th that they were paying off the vehicle and, as a result,  I did not make the October 28th payment.  
I called Bank of America on November 11th to confirm they had received the payment and they claimed they had not however Allstate confirmed the payment was sent.  
I received confirmation on Nov 27th that the loan was paid in full.  
Although the payment has now been received by Bank of America, they have chosen to list a late payment on my credit report.  December 7th my score dropped 128 points based on my Transunion report.  I called Bank of America and Allstate on Friday the 7th in a panic as I have current plans that require my credit.   Allstate apologized and also contacted Bank of America on my behalf and via a conference call with me on the line to help explain the issue.  I attempted to explain this is based on inaccurate information and was asking for Bank of America to assist me and adjust the payment history to reflect the final payment has been received and remove the only late payment on my credit history.     I spoke with Vxxxxy ........ who was rude, condescending and had a very confrontational approach.  I was shocked at the way she chose to approach the situation.  I requested her supervisor's contact information and then contacted her supervisor Cxxxxe M. on December 10th 2018 as directed.    That was also a very unpleasant experience and I am truly disappointed.  I would have gladly paid the one (1) remaining payment to not have my credit impacted this way and to treat me the way they did was completely unacceptable.  
I have contacted Bank of America through email via contact us on their website and was called back by Kxxxxa A.  She conducted herself more professional than the previous two (2) however could not do anything.  She made me feel as if my situation was unimportant and then pawned me off the best she could to get off the phone.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and apparently they do not have supervisors that you can speak to.  She instructed me to call back and ask for her supervisor Cxxxxxa H, or her supervisor's supervisor Cxxxxxa S.  All of which have the same title of supervisor and do not have direct lines, emails, or extensions.  I need to call the 800 number and ask for them?  Sounds like I am being put off.  
I also contacted BOA through Facebook and was contacted via messenger by Julio.  He forwarded me to Pxxl K from the Debt collecting department.  I have left four (4) messages and have not received a response.

I opened a claim back in august against a fraudulent charge that I made from a company that was actually sued by the FTC.At the time FTC had the company shut down with a temporary restraining order.
In august we submitted all the documentation to BOA : Brake down of the service we were supposed to receive,how it took place,where and when it took place along with all invoices and restraining order from the FTC with all information regarding the case including the leading attorney on the case from both the state and the FTC.
I got a response in the beginning september that my claim was denied due to missing information reagarding the brake down of the charge and how i took place.In my letter was explain in great detail how the charge was made,what was the service we never received and how it took place.Not only that ,there was a several other examples of this case on the FTC report that explaind it in even greater detail.
So right away I called the bank and reopened the claim.
I was told by the Bank representative that she would re-opened the claim and she doesn`t know why was denied the first time giving all the information provided.
This time I had no response from BOA for over 60 days .
So i called back.
They told me my claim was closed because FTC had only issued a temporary restraining order and they needed proof that the company in question is permanently shut down.
I called both the State and the FTC leading attorneys to see what is the status on the case.
I was told that the case was close and the company was shut down for good.
I was then told to have BOA call the attorney  s  office or the FTC to confirm that information or request more information regarding the case if needed.
BOA straight up refused to do that and insisted on having an official statement that the company in question was in fact a fraudulent and is no longer operating.
Few days FTC released the final report on the case to the public and I was able to provide it to BOA. HOWEVER THIS IS THE RESPONSE AFTER 5 MONTHS

Bank of america sent me an email saying the account was closed due to inactivity with no warning, no mailer or email.  This has had an impact on my credit score because of the utilization.  On top of that they will not stop sending emails to sign up for another card and pulled my credit without my 
 verbal permission in ""reopening"" the card.   2 people reached out from the underwriting department and were of no help at all.  It is important to go with a credit company that isn't dishonest.

The computer screen said the ""credit card did not go through."" Of course I didn't know why until I went back and double checked my entries. That's when I discovered my error.

However, Bank of America (BOA), immediately blocked the card. And I could not make further purchases with the card.

They give me only one chance to get the expiration date correct. After that BOA blocked the card. And they did not tell me why. All my work of putting my name and the names of my fellow passengers, our addresses, our birth dates, our TSA precheck numbers, etc., etc was lost. Airline tickets are time sensitive.. Don't have the data correct and the ticket is zeroed out.

My personal computer gives you three tries to get your password right. 

One strike and you are out with the American Express credit card. That is a ridiculous policy.

I received a charge from **** magazine of $75.XX yearly subscription in August, which is higher than $49 stated in its magazine. I called **** customer service to cancel the unreasonable charge right away. Due to their management transition, the customer service line couldn't locate my subscription to cancel it. Therefore I called BOA to dispute this charge. BOA asked me to upload information on line in a timely manner. I uploaded the magazine page to show the credit card charged more than the magazine stated. To my surprise, BOA denied my dispute. I called BOA customer service immediately. The customer service representative promised me no worries, the charge will be resolved. No more action is needed. To my further surprise, I received another letter from BOA shortly to ask me for more information to support the dispute within a very short time frame. I was forced to call **** magazine again and again but due to their management transition issue, I can't get a cancellation letter within 4 - 8 weeks, which is longer than BOA's window. It means I'll be forced to pay the charge before the due date to avoid a late fee. I feel BOA does nothing to help except pushing customers to provide evidence. I won't contact BOA if I can resolve the issue between me and vendor. BOA, as an intermediary between the customer and the vendor, should refuse the charge from the vendor. I told customer representatives I'm willing to pay it if it's a reasonable charge. Unfortunately **** magazine is in horrible transition and wouldn't deal well with customers. BOA should stand by the customer's side to stop the unhealthy relationship with the bad vendor so that customer can use BOA's service to build a better relationship with other vendors. I'm very disappointed that BOA just keeps asking customer providing information in a very short time frame, in more demanding ways (from upload to on line banking to Fax or mail information to its *********). BOA is getting more and more unfriendly to its customers. It's not an amount I can't afford. But I'm very unsatisfied with BOA's attitude toward customer's dispute.

I willingly agreed to an online credit card at checkout from a website that I was booking travel in exchange for a discount off the fair and travel incentives. The credit was approved and charged immediately.  The amount charged was $128.50.  I affirm that I never received card within the mail. I received from them mail that looked like junk mail without anything identifying them as Bank of America. All of those mails were never opened and tossed with the other junk mail.  Recently, I received a mail from them CLEARLY IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES using their NAME/LOGO stating that I owed them $256.99. I thought it to be spam until I called and became upset because I did not see any bills with a sender from Bank of America but received the collection notice with them being the sender.  Do note, at all times until I received the collection notice, that I didn't know who backed the online credit received when I was paying for my airlines ticket, nor did I know who to call, nor did I know that I was being billed because all looked like junk mail.  The matter was escalated and I agreed to pay the bill.  The manager told me that the bill was now $354.00 even from 3 months of not paying on the card.  Without hesitation, I paid the bill the same day that I received a clear NOTICE of a bill at one of their banking centers.  After I paid the bill, I was told that the account was already closed many days before I even received the mail. This puzzled me because I asked them to closed the account during the conversation, yet NO ONE TOLD ME THAT THE ACCOUNT WAS ALREADY CLOSED.  I am like wow!!!! How can they charge me late payments fees of $101.00, interest, and an additional  $97.01 dollars when they knew the account was closed.  So, in total, I was charged an additional $225.50.  I had to contact the credit bureau  to lodge a dispute after I paid the $354.00 in order to remove the late payment history.  I called back to the bank. The automated system said that I had a credit of $156.00.  I didn't need a credit on a closed account and it was $69.50 short from the $225.50 ($156.00 + $69.50 = $225).  At worse, it should have been an additional $10.50 more because the annual fee was $59.00.  My account was sealed such that I had to authorize the person to look at it after they sent me a text message. After he opened the account, his demeanor changed as he stated that he was reading the notes. I clearly stated that I was now recording the call.  I requested for  the monies owed to me to be sent to me after the bank employee confirmed that their system did not indicate that a refund was being sent out. I then asked for a  Letter of Satisfaction, which was already requested on the day the account was satisfied.  He said it be scheduled to go out.  I ask for written confirmation that the credit bureau was updated and he got short on the phone, but, said it was updated. It is MY BELIEF that it was updated ONLY because I initiated the action.  I then asked why was I charged more money on a closed account that was already sent to collection when I the consumer wasn't informed that it was closed.  He refused to answer and stayed silent the entire time .... the call held an additional 2 minutes and 12 seconds without him saying anything.  I wasn't put on hold.  I then recorded myself noting that the Bank of America employee refused to disclosed why $97.01 was added to a closed account within their collections department when the customer called to pay the balance of $256.99 .  I just wanted an explanation, even if it was, we are charging you interest for the first month and the annual credit card fee.... but, I didn't even get an explanation.  To add icing on the cake, I received on the same day of my final call with Bank of America (10-04-2018) another unidentified piece of mail from them exclusively going over late payment fees that will be charged, despite the card being closed already.  That was sent to satisfy  the CFCB on a complaint I made against them.  I learned two things: 1) always open every piece of mail going forth and 2) never accept online credit when you are at check-out to pay for travel or anything else.</div>, <div class=""MuiTypography-root Text-sc-12c66pm-0 fgbKlJ MuiTypography-body2"">Thank you for sharing your experience.

On September 6th I obtained a court order via the probate division of Pinellas County Florida to access the decedent's checking account. The court order specifically states ""there be an immediate distribution of the assets of the decedent."" I take the court order to the branch on the 6th that the decedent dealt with expecting them to release the funds to the Trust for which I was the executor. Never easy with B of A! A call has to be made to the corporate office and the paperwork sent directly via the latest technology and despite what the court order says I have to fill out paperwork and am told that it will be 7 to 10 business days until I receive the check. I call the bank on Monday the 24th and inquire as to what is happening and find the check was issued on the 20th and to expect it in the mail soon. Mail just came. It's the 26th. No check so tomorrow, if it comes, will be 21 days since I presented a court order for the ""immediate distribution of the assets."" I wonder what they would charge ** if I was 21 days late with a payment? Also had issues accessing another account there and a safety deposit box. I do not want this to be an all negative review as I would really want to compliment the employees of this branch office in Safety Harbor as they have always tried to be helpful but they seem to be at the mercy of the corporate office that evidently feels it is above the law.</div>, <div class=""MuiTypography-root Text-sc-12c66pm-0 fgbKlJ MuiTypography-body2"">Thank you for sharing your experience.

I then transferred $7,000 over to the new credit card making my credit line, $9,900, and my old credit card line was then $1,900. This showed on my account for two days, and then the $1,900 disappeared without anyone reaching out to me. I had already made the balance transfer when I was approved for the credit limit increase. Now I am left with being unable to do the full balance transfer, which was the whole point of opening on this card.

With hundreds of thousands of customers if not millions feeding its greed with monthly maintenance fees and late charges with no one but mere pawns to utter company policy type language after ""Bank Hours"" when of course time matters the most, the machine of a business entity rolls on ignorantly avoiding responsibly bc they can with fine print, while penelizing every mishap that could be created or imagined with FEES.  How about We customers charge you a late fee.  The biggest issue I'd say is inevidable legal theft.  How can it be possible that in the 21st century the largest bank can hold a check deposited into an atm for 10 business days or more to ""verify"" it's legitimacy before clearing it for their own customer.  Most costumers have bills that are due weekly, monthly, dayly whom also have penalties for those companies if not payed on time let alone credit rating contingencies and more.  This proves that time is far more valuable than money and this particular bank seizes your check if deposited into an atm, then spits out a reciept / notice that says it will hold the check until the following month with a set date before releasing funds to your account 10 business days or more. This is the customers' money not yours! Customers are forced by availability and compliance into keeping funds at a more common bank in checking accounts in order to pay bills and conduct business transactions in some form other than cash for all types of crucial reasons. It's a domino effect and once your bank sits on their thumbs and says processing everything is left to speculation because Bank of America employees can't disclose the progression of the processing time period.  Bank of America! Stop excusing your legal theft with fine print! Make a call the following business day to the bank of record and verify the funds if you're so concerned as to the ligitimacy of any particular check deposit. DON't TAKE 2 WEEKS TO VARIFY CHECKS WHERE EVER THEY ARE DEPOSITED; WHETHER IN PERSON OR ATM!!!  THE CUSTOMERS OR ""MASSES"" OR ""NUMBERS"" IS SURELY HOW MOST OF BANK CUSTOMERS FEEL THEY ARE , HAVE BILLS TO PAY AND NONE OF US ARE GETTING RICH AS FAST AS YOUR ENDLESS FEES ARE MAKING YOUR ENTITY PER DAY MORE WEALTHY THAN IM SURE MOST COULD EVEN COMPREHEND!!!!! WOW!!! DO YOU REALLY THINK THE MASSES OF CUSTOMERS THAT FEED YOUR IGNORANT GREEDY FACE ARE THAT STUPID? 2 WEEKS TO VARIFY A CHECK!!! This is so sad. Just make a phone call to the other bank and verify. It shouldn't take two week to do so for any type of check! If it's fraudulent the use you technology to identify in less than 3 days.  Remember it's the 21st century and communication is supposedly instant., fiber optics, WiFi. The invention of the telephone without robots or answering machines to avoid responsibility. Email, texting, cameras, etc.. FIGURE IT OUT AND COMPANSATE ** FOR ALL THE PAIN YOU CUASE WHILE YOUR BANKS SUMITS ON ITS THUMBS TO VARIFY A MONEY THAT WILL MAKE OR BREAK US.  Remember folks don't always have gardens or yards or ways of survival for even just food. Money is how they  stay alive these days so don't **** with customers money that's not your banks money it's the customers money and you need to give them access to it within a very reasonable time frame from when they get payed or deposit into THEIR bank account not your bank account.

My escrow account was review at the beginning of 2018.   I contacted Bank of American in January and February 2018 and was informed that I didn't have a short fall in my escrow account for 2018.  All of my obligations were paid for 2018 from my current escrow account.   The account as of today, April 12, 2018, doesn't have a short fall.  All require payment from the account will be paid.

I called Bank of American to find out why I received a letter about 2019 when we are still in 2018.  I spoke to a rep, in Phoenix, he informed me that my account was evaluated again using the projected insurance and tax amounts for 2019 and they arrived at this amount.  I asked the rep, was my current escrow account short.  He said no, the account was current.  I asked him how this assessment could be done again in this year when Bank of American has not received any bills for 2019.  

I told the rep, if I paid this amount that was cause me escrow account to have an overage and that I didn't think that was legal.  How can I be expected to pay for a 2019 escrow short fall when the bills have not been submitted to Bank of America for 2019.  The rep transferred me to a manager, and we had the same discussion.   She informed me that there was nothing she could do.  She filed a complaint for me with the bank.
This is in my view, on the situation. It is a form of extortion because I am being forced to pay a debt that has not happened.   Bank of America doesn't have any bills to pay regarding my account for 2019.  They will hold my funds and millions of other customers as an asset to make loans and draw interest to increase their profits.

I go to a lot of concerts and know how to not buy fake tickets. That is not what happened. When I arrived at the arena, we were told there was a huge ticket scandal(about 400 people) and they gave us a letter to give to my bank to get a refund. The letter stated the tickets were fraudulent. A few days later I send my letter the the claims department via mail, and the charge drops off. I thought I was in the clear. 2 months later, the charge is back. I take my letter to the bank and have them fax it to the claims department to ensure they receive it. They gave me the receipt of the successful fax and tell me it should be in my account soon and sorry for the inconvenience. Another month goes by and I receive ANOTHER letter saying my claim is closed because they never received proof even though it was faxed from the branch on Canton hwy. I returned to this branch and the associate I deal with is extremely rude, and basically tells me there is nothing they can do but they will stand by while I get on the phone with the claims department. After being on hold for 45 minutes, I get on the phone with a supervisor that wants the fax sent straight to him so he can make sure it's taken care of. I thought this was finally being handled. They send the fax and I'm told he will call me back tomorrow to follow up. I received another successful fax receipt. 4 days go by and I get no phone call. So I call the claim center again, they state they have no records of me calling, sending or filing anything. ALSO, the claim is now too old to be reopened. So now I am out 200 dollars because my bank can't seem to send a fax and failed to have any sort of customer service.

When we purchased our first home we had it written into the contract that the loan could not be sold to Bank of America.  Well it was transferred to Countrywide/Wells Fargo then to Bank of America.  It has been a nightmare from the get go.  Do not  mail payments because they conveniently and consistently lost. They have held payments for up to 96 days after clearing my bank before posting them while charging late fees. Will not clear the fees.  Not paid my taxes two separate occasions. Not paid my homeowner insurance two separate occasions. Lost the escrow accts, Had the home in Washington listed as a condo in Mexico.  Then out of the blue started receiving my statements in spanish this took 9 months to clear up.  Posted payment to someone else acct. They document nothing so its pointless to call and follow up on an issue. Take payments every month to a local branch so I have a paper receipt to prove their in ablity to keep any kind of records. Stanwood Branch dates the payments for the next business not the day they receive payment. Received foreclosure notice 3 days after a payment that was on time.  3 days folks! Ive stopped calling when there is an issue but cause frankly I'm afraid of what will come next.

So after my mortgage being at Bank of America for years, I learned it was transferred to Carrington Mortgage Services LLC.  I received my first invoice for payment less than 10 days before it was due resulting in an online payment that cost an additional $5.00.  I signed up for automatic payments, which takes 2 months to be effective in today's electronic world.  I pay extra principal each month.  I went with the bi-monthly payments.  The confirm page showed the mortgage P&amp;I with escrow divided between the 1st and 15th of each month and the extra principal amount divided in half for each payment.  I then received a confirmation letter that stated everything above, but the extra principal payment amount was cut in half of what I requested.  When I called the customer service number they stated they do not have access to those numbers.  How can they not have access to my automatic payments when I set them up through their webpage?  Customer service is less than helpful and fails to answer the question asked.  Even if they understand the question, the response is they don't have access to my mortgage account details.  Nice of Bank of America to sell this mortgage to this company so I can waste my time on the phone with them and my time refinancing just to get away from Carrington.  To be far to BOA, this review is also being posted on Carrington's review, but make no mistake it was BOA that started this entire process in motion.</div>, <div class=""MuiTypography-root Text-sc-12c66pm-0 fgbKlJ MuiTypography-body2"">Bank of America welcomes all feedback and we appreciate the opportunity to further assist our customers.</div>]",03/19/2018,Bank of America welcomes all feedback and we appreciate the opportunity to further assist our customers.,bbb.org,mortgage

I was finally able to deposit my check but I was unable to withdraw some money.

I went to speak to the Relationship Manager, ******* *****, and she told me that someone was coming to fix it. I asked her why that ATM machine has a different problem every day, and she responded in a mocking manner that it was the machine's problem and the machine is serviced by a third party. 

I asked her again why the machine has constant problems as every time you go to a teller, they ask you to use the ATM instead. She insisted that it wasn't the bank's fault. She was very evasive and didn't seem like she cared at all that customers face a continuous problem with that branch.

WHAT??? A bank turning down a large deposit. Hmm... something's very wrong.  
So I called the corporate office and spoke to a customer service rep named Brian W***** who was very pleasant and said he was just as shocked as I was. He helped me file a complaint and said he would let the upper management know as this is not company policy.  Yet I understand the company has chosen to reduce staff in all branches and they don't allow for back up when one person goes to lunch. Business just stopped because they only had one teller on the line. Even though there are several other bodies standing around. I left and deposited my money elsewhere.
What happened to good ole ""customer service"" but  I guess the other complaints on this  website about Bank of America answers that.  It's just not a priority!!

Had an ebanking checking account (free checking as long as transactions weren't made through a teller) and they suddenly stopped offering the ebanking account with no notice- I had just ordered new checks. I got to use one of the checks. Complete waste of money. Everything I had was hooked up to this account; direct deposit, bill pay, and the like. It was inconvenient to have to change, but I am glad Bank of America forced my hand. They would waive the checking fee if I kept a certain balance in the account (I don't keep high balances in my checking account- I use it strictly for bill pay) or if I had a certain amount direct deposited into the account. I bartend and my pay checks were direct deposited, but I get paid weekly, and they are not large checks, so it wasn't enough to cover.

Bank of America, of course, instantly hit me with a large fee. I called their 1-800 number to see if the fee could be reversed. The phone service said the wait would be between one hour and fifteen minutes and two hours and thirty minutes. This seemed absurdly long. Fortunately--or so I thought--it offered an option where BoA would call me back when I had reached the front of the extremely long hold queue. I chose that option. However, when the call back came, it only let the phone ring once before hanging up. So I had to call the 1-800 number and get back in the queue.

I checked my account and noticed transactions being made and call the back right away. The managers refused to provide me with the call center manager's information, or their information.

She talked to a supervisor and told ** okay but they can only give ** a certain amount out of ** account because I will hit ** daily withdraw limit. She insured ** I can go back the next day to withdraw more. I was okay with this took what I could and waited for the next day. So afterwork once again I drive 19 miles to this virtual teller ATM and went through this process again. Only to be told a different story. That since I did not have an atm card and ** major credit card is enough proof with ** DL I cannot withdraw ANY MONEY! Even though the night before with a supervisors permission I got money out! She continued to argue with ** that she had no idea why they were able to give ** money because they cannot through their system. So I wasted ** time, ** gas. putting 19 miles on ** car one way for no reason. Glad I Zelle'e money to ** husbands Chase account and canceled ** BoA account for good!

This has gotten me to be so infuriated more than I can count!  That at the end of this line I will be finally closing my account. Thankfully this will be my last time in line. Doesn't seem like this branch cares so what the point of keeping the account. Teller **** was more successful in being professional than the managers.

I went to get my 1st mortgage in 2016 and found out she never took it out of my name and purposely let it default because of winning custody of my son. BOA was mailing her trying to contact me instead of finding me to tell me I even owed it! I thought it was over 12yrs ago. So BOA tells me to take her to court and get a judgement stating I am not at fault, so I did (more $$ out of my pocket) and I won the judgement and they still won't honor it. I CANNOT get a mortgage because they failed in every way possible and will NOT make it right. Credit bureaus will do nothing because of BOA.

We have a very horrible experience with BOA home loan.  Recently we have applied for a home loan from BOA.  The first contact with the loan officer did not show up the next day based on our appointment.  We did not receive any phone call or email from the loan officer.  The branch manager referred us to a different loan officer at other location.   Our loan amount is 36% of condo purchase price.  We put 64% down payment for the condo.

We have submitted all the required documents: tax return for 2015 and 2016 tax year, detail investment portfolio from two investment bankers. last two years saving and checking accounts details, annuity contract statement, credit reports, condo purchase escrow contract information, and condo buying contract.  Our credits show we are over 800 score. At the end, they still said those documents are not enough. Furthermore they want to know our spending pattern. They even question our son's property and all our 30 years residential properties history. They asked when and why we sold the properties in the past 30 years. Also, they question us why we spent $2,000 and $3,000  the two months ago.  I think BOA has violated  our privacy law and treated us like a criminal.  Most of the  questions are nothing to do with home loan.    We thought we were well qualified for this small amount of loan.  Unfortunately, they asked so many silly questions which are not related to the loan at all. Those people handling the loan in the BOA loan department are so ridiculous and ignorant without any common sense. 

We were so fed up and upset with all those BOA irrelevant questions.  Finally we just walked out the door and asked for the return of all submitted documents and delete all our investment banker's detail financial PDF files downloaded to their computer.   In addition I will cancel ** BOA credit card for good and no more future business with them.  We believe the BOA top management sitting in the eiffel tower have no idea what their people are doing.  BOA must change their business practice and should have some common sense.  For the last words, BOA should respect the right of people's privacy and no discrimination attitude.
