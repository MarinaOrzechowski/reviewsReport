0,Walter,12/07/2020,1,"Customer ServiceI have been a customer for many, many years and all I can say is that the customer service at the bank is terrible.  Today, the line to see the teller was getting long and I asked the manager to get some help and her response was that she had a client and was too busy to assist all the customers in line.  As time went on, the people in line started to complain more and more.  The manager came out of the office and was listening to the complaints as she was speaking with another representative and they laughed about the whole situation before she returned to her office.\n\nBecause of the long line and the lack of consideration that the bank showed to its customers, two customers made decisions that were not favorable for the bank.  One customer left in a huff and the other customer who I was speaking to decided to withdraw more than 20k dollars and close his accounts.\n\nIf this is what the bank in Sun City Center wished, then it received its wishes.\n\nI am seriously considering closing all my accounts with the bank because of its lack of customer service",,,trustpilot.com

I go to the teller and as usual he tells me the deposit slips are behind me. I grab a deposit slip as I’m walking back to the teller window to ask a question about the slip another teller at least 3 chairs down yells to me I’m not aloud to stand at the window. I replied to her I needed to ask a question she then responded how hard is it to fill out a slip, name, date and address. I continued to ask my question to the teller that was assisting  me but she continues to say”tell him to move tell him to move” so I responded Your not even helping me I don’t understand what the problem is? As I open my mouth to ask him my question she interrupted me yet again so I angrily responded “tell her to shut the f*** up” she then told me to get out. I told her I’m a customer here that I put my money in this bank you can call the police because I’m not leaving I also told her You need to show some respect. She told me that I needed to show her respect. The manager comes out because it’s now a big commotion between us two. The manager speaks to me and allows me to finish up my deposit with the teller, as the teller is completing my deposit the manager and I  are discussing the situation as her employee is still ranting very loud behind the teller glass. I express to the manager to watch how her employee is acting this is the same behavior she gave me upon walking in. I asked for her employees name because I made a formal complaint with boa she refused to give it to me. The manager then told me we are both at fault because I used foul language. She also told me it’s been a long day which I told her I understand it happens. But I never approached nor opened my mouth to ask that angry teller anything.

I go to the teller and as usual he tells me the deposit slips are behind me. I grab a deposit slip as I’m walking back to the teller window to ask a question about the slip another teller at least 3 chairs down yells to me I’m not aloud to stand at the window. I replied to her I needed to ask a question she then responded how hard is it to fill out a slip, name, date and address. I continued to ask my question to the teller that was assisting  me but she continues to say”tell him to move tell him to move” so I responded Your not even helping me I don’t understand what the problem is? As I open my mouth to ask him my question she interrupted me yet again so I angrily responded “tell her to shut the f*** up” she then told me to get out. I told her I’m a customer here that I put my money in this bank you can call the police because I’m not leaving I also told her You need to show some respect. She told me that I needed to show her respect. The manager comes out because it’s now a big commotion between us two. The manager speaks to me and allows me to finish up my deposit with the teller, as the teller is completing my deposit the manager and I  are discussing the situation as her employee is still ranting very loud behind the teller glass. I express to the manager to watch how her employee is acting this is the same behavior she gave me upon walking in. I asked for her employees name because I made a formal complaint with boa she refused to give it to me. The manager then told me we are both at fault because I used foul language. She also told me it’s been a long day which I told her I understand it happens. But I never approached nor opened my mouth to ask that angry teller anything. So why is she taking her day out on me?wasn’t even at her window. So I’m still confused as to her deranged behavior all in all this was a bad experience",,,trustpilot.com

I called and explained the situation to them, they said it was a valid charge and they would not remove the late fee.  What HORRIBLE customer service.  I asked what the process was to close my account, the  customer rep informed me of what damage I could do to my credit score if I closed a credit card account with 30K worth of credit. Really?

BofA bought my home mortgage loan in May 2020 from my previous lender and from day 1 it has been THE ABSOLUTE WORST experience EVER!  First thing they did was tell me that I owed money for my escrow and that if I paid on time my mortgage would only be $1421+ and not spread out over 12 months with the mortgage being $1455+!  I hadn\u0027t even been their customer for a month at that point!  I paid the escrow through a teller who didn\u0027t know how to apply the loan to ESCROW so that was an unfortunate hurdle to cross!  Since then I have been on the phone ONCE A MONTH and at times MORE than once with hold times of 2 hours or more only to find out I was speaking to the wrong dept!  They CLAIM to be able to see prior calls but APPARENTLY they don\u0027t bother to read them because they say they can\u0027t confirm what other representatives have told me!  They ASSURE me that everything is fine and taken care of or WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF because they have ESCALATED my concerns to their supervisor!  I have requested an email or some sort of correspondence be sent to me verifying that they have indeed taken care of it but I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANYTHING! Go figure, they can send out all the NEGATIVE correspondence but heaven forbid they send out anything of a positive nature!  In the meantime, I have been threatened with late fees because they can\u0027t seem to get their act together!  Last conversation of 4 days ago with yet ANOTHER mortgage rep was the last straw, I even said that I was going to refinance because I\u0027m tired of the BS runaround and it didn\u0027t seem to faze him!  He also told me that a payment of $700 that was ALSO not applied correctly FROM JUNE 2020 was now corrected and applied to my mortgage and that he also escalated this to his manager so that it could be handled in one day rather than the 14 or 15 days it normally takes! I was lied to again because he told me that he or his manager would call me and let me know that it was taken care of but of course I am still waiting to hear something 4 days later!  In the meantime I am left to wonder whether I will be hit with a late fee because of their BS mistakes!  I feel sorry for anyone of the reps that work for such a poorly run company! I think they should all be ashamed of themselves for such shoddy UNPROFESSIONAL service!  Just waiting for my refi to go through so that I can finally say SAYONARA BofA!

I have been a Bank customer for over 11years! I was devastated everything I had was connected to this bank. Im received disability direct deposits to this bank! For them to fo this and not tell me why? Well needless to say I was not going to take this without an explanation! I wrote and called there corporate office until finally some one got back to me a lady named Devin Harris who told me that someone filed a 3000.00 claim on my account and claimed to be me! I told her that there\u0027s was no way I filed a claim. I explained to her that I applied for a loan and was approved. I have the emails and loan documents to prove it. She told me that I could go and open up another account because I may have been the victim of a scam. I had to get a new account number and everything. She saud my identity may have been compromised. I was devasted. Why didnt anyine call me from the Bank right away or tell me something when I called 6 times prior? I made a repoet to the FTC and FBI. Now Sun Credit Financial is harassing over 3000.00 they saying I defaulted on the loan. So now I dont know what to do. Then well my direct deposit from socially security goes to my old account thats supposed to be closed. I was suppos3s to wait for it to go back to socially security so they can send it back to me by mail but Bank of America kept it! They said it was part of the investigation!

Yesterday i tried to move funds over from account to account,and the mobile app stopped working....its funny how it stops working,when its time for them to get thier nsf fees. Im complaining cause its not rite how boa fixes thier system so it only works in thier favor.  Then when you call in and ask for a manager, they put you on the phone with another associate sittingin the next cubicle, thats how they did me today,11/10/20,Texas location, then again i dont know if it was Texas cause they lie so much about thier names and bs numbers. I know cause the lady i talked to today,used the same number as someone else that was a man,the last time i talked to someone, with the same number. The same thing happened to me last weekend thier app mysteriously stopped working.  A good smile and a nice hello is out dated,now a days,we need businesses to deliver, the product they are advertising. Boa is not doing this and this is why you are considered to be the worse bank in America.  Thanks boa in texas for nothing, im sure u wont send a survey to my email this time. I hope your employees have other jobs lined up ,cause at this rate,your company wont be in existence for very long. The last thing i would like to add is this.....boa...can 1 person teach everyone how to talk to the people that call in? I knew more than both of the people i talked to today,i had more insight than they both had as well, its not good when the callers knows boa s job,better than they do.

What do I do with this I wonder. Anyways, call customer service and the lady tersely tells me that because the check had two names on it they couldn\u0027t cash it. Mind you she was totally rude and didn\u0027t offer any help or other information. That was two months ago - I mailed the copy of the check to my third party whose name was also on the check. He obviously had no idea what to do with it, and why would he? Anyways, I gave up on that endeavor and accepted that I wouldn\u0027t be getting my $1200 stimulus money. Just gone. But it gets better. On October 29 I saw my account go from 600ish to 0. Calling \u0022customer service\u0022 I got a non answer of \u0022that\u0027s from your state\u0022. Wha? Anyways, I did some research on Google and called again. This time I got a \u0022response\u0022 about it\u0027s from this and this number. Apparently something about the CA Franchise Tax board. Now I know CA is a sleazy state that will happily take your money if it can, but in this case I don\u0027t blame CA, I blame BoA. This is clearly a fraudulent transaction from some shady third party. But BoA never gave me the option to dispute the transaction nor were they any help on the phone. I would call again but I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll hit another brick wall. I\u0027m not going to dignify them with my time. They were already rude twice, I\u0027d just be proving myself to be a fool if I called them again and tried to resolve",,,trustpilot.com

After 4 hours on the phone, they promised that I would get that money back, but two weeks later nothing happened, now I have to spend more and more time on hold listening to the same god dang song for 6 hours. I need to pay my rent, and allowing a customer to lose $3000 and lie to them about it coming back is inexcusable.\n\nEDIT: Also in many of my attempts to call them, they end the phone call on their end while I\u0027m still on hold after waiting for over an hour and a half.\n\nUPDATE: They still haven\u0027t given me my money back, these people don\u0027t care about their customers.

102,Ashur Khan,10/15/2020,1,"FraudOn June 8th, 2020 there were two unauthorized charges on my Bank of America account. One charge was for $57.55 from MenuStar, a company that doesn\u0027t even service my area, and the other was from DoorDash for a restaurant named Buona, where I\u0027ve never eaten in my life, for $36.12. I called the company within a couple of days, and by June 9th, there was a credit on my account for these two charges and a fraud investigation had been started. My card was canceled and a new card was sent out to me. On July 8th, 2020 the credits were reversed. The company sent me a letter telling me that the orders from these services came from my device and that they match my previous account activity. I reached out to DoorDash who confirmed this was fraud, and they refunded me $36.12. I also contacted MenuStar who confirmed that the transaction was fraud, but all they need is for BOA to reach out to them notifying them that a fraud claim was submitted. The bank doesn\u0027t want to contact the vendor for some reason, and therefore I\u0027m stuck with the amount of $57.55. I am still in possession of the card that was used, so I was not negligent in any way. Somehow these criminals got a hold of my card, and I don\u0027t want to finance their food or lifestyle. Bank of America needs to make this right. They have a $0 liability guarantee which should be applied in this scenario. I get an e-mail from Vernon White who never answers his phone or returns my calls to confirm my complaint with the CFPB. This avoidance is totally unethical and a way for BOA to work around the CFPB. At this point this is impacting my credit score, and it\u0027s not okay. I contacted the fraud department and asked to speak with a manager, and they said someone would call me, and it has almost been a week and no phone call. AVOID BOA!

Bank of America really needs to step up its software and system.\n\nBoFA\u0027s software and customer service is really terrible. We had a person we could contact for any mortgage related issues in Wells Fargo, but at BoFA, you are stuck with their automated customer service which can put you on hold for hours. The worst customer service and experience I have had so far.",,,trustpilot.com
117,Deb,10/01/2020,1,"Beware of how BOA calculates loan payoffs and be prepared to wait for hours on the phoneWe recently refinanced our former Bank of America loan with a new lender.  It is customary for the payoff amount to include the per diem interest for the current month through the day of closing and an additional 3 days of interest for the refinance rescission period.  In our case 24 days of interest should have been charged as part of our payoff because we closed on 9/21.  Instead Bank of America charged us interest through 10/2, and, although I caught the mistake before we closed the refinance loan, the closing attorney said we had to take it up with Bank of America after the closing.  That is where the problem gets worse.\n\nThey do not answer their customer service phone number unless you stay on the line and wait for hours listening to music. The ridiculous phone menu repeats itself and makes it very difficult to speak to a human being.  And then once you get someone on the phone, they find ways to disconnect the call, and you are back to square one.  On my fourth phone call (after being on Muzak hold for over two hours), I asked the customer service representative to please jot down my phone number in case we got disconnected.  She said should could not do that and promised she would stay on the line.  Of course, we got disconnected as soon as she had to put me on hold to ask someone else my two very basic questions.  I also spent over a week and half trying to use their secure email function and never got a response until today, a week and a half later.  The email response spent more time apologizing for their poor customer service than it did answering my questions; instead, I got a canned statement about my query being sent to their team for further research and that would take another ten days.\n\nThe bottom line is we were overcharged hundreds of dollars on our mortgage loan payoff and I am finding it impossible to get an answer on when we can expect to receive our money back or even an acknowledgement that they owe the difference. In addition, it will take them 14 - 21 to refund my $5k escrow balance.  Why?  They could easily transfer our escrow balance to our checking account; they have confirmed receiving our full payoff a week ago. But no, it will take several more weeks for BOA to return our escrow fund even though we need those funds to pay our property taxes that are coming due soon.\n\nIn my opinion, BOA is making money on our funds and the stalling techniques employed are nothing more than terrible customer service layered on top of unethical practices. Our relationship with this bank ends with this experience.  We have been loyal customers for over 30 years, probably 40 but whose counting?",,,trustpilot.com

You may want to look closely to your account.  I did not receive notice of the late fee and returned ACH.  The issue is entirely with BOA.  My payments are paid automatically on the 1st of the month.  I had well over enough funds in the account to pay the mortgage.  They then ran the payment request on the 3rd of the month.  BOA has a 15-day grace period for mortgages which I have never used.  So even if there were not funds in the account (which there was) I would still fall under the grace period.  This is Day 2 I have been holding and transferred to two departments so far.  There are long wait times due to the overwhelming customer service issues caused by their system update.  In addition, the customer service employees can only give you their first names and are unable to provide last names or employee IDs.  So as the last person I spoke with said their manager agreed the charges should be waived but their department did not have the authority to waive the fees the problem BOA created.\nTo say I am disappointed is an understatement.

I opened a checking, savings, business, and had 3 credit cards with them. In the last 6 months (during the corona pandemic) they went ahead and cancelled all my credit cards. They sent me a letter listing several generic reasons why they made the decision to close my credit cards. I was really upset after they closed my last one and decided to call they and none of the reps knew what to tell me so they kept transferring me around. I finally spoke to a Supervisor and explained my situation and told him that I either needed a valid reason why my cards were cancelled or needed them to reopen one of my cards. The \u0022Supervisor\u0022 very rudely told me that they have the right to close my account for whatever reason and that they will not be reopening any of my accounts.

AND ALL THE PRESSURE THAT IT CAUSES. ESPECIALLY BEING A SINGLE PARENT, WHEN AT THAT VERY CRUCIAL TIME, WHEN YOU, YOURSELF NEED SUPPORT, THE FATHER DECIDES THAT HE CAN\u0027T DEAL WITH IT. UNFORTUNATELY, THAT IS ALL TO COMMON! I also grew up in a tremendous amount of pain. (That continues to this day). Taking almost two decades before finally finding out that I had arthritis. Eventually was diagnosed with two forms of arthritis, fibromyalgia, sacroiliitis, spinal stenosis, and major migraines. After years and years of dealing with doctors who told me it was in my head. Telling my parents, I was looking for attention, when I would say I couldn\u0027t go outside and play because my knees hurt really bad. Or it was just growing pains. I now, support many people in their life with chronic pain. Because unless you live with it, it\u0027s very hard to understand. And have compassion. Because most people get tired of hearing you complain about the pain. So you, eventually, learn to bite your tongue and just plaster a smile on your face and just tell everybody you\u0027re fine. So long ago between my chronic pain, and having a daughter with autism (which was extremely rare back then because it was mainly found in boys.) I\u0027ve learned that I\u0027ve gone through difficult, decades of all that. So that, I\u0027m able to help others get through the same things in life.

He has said that my boss (Pete Barker) at my job (Variety Wholesalers Inc.) would pay me back. But, I have never gotten my money back at all. So, I tried to contact Bank of America (BoA) about this despicable act against me. The Bank of America website has no email communication at all. I have tried calling the bank a few times. However, the BoA employees are too busy with other customers. I have to return to work sadly. Another disappointment is that a BoA location has permanently closed in my city (Henderson, North Carolina). Some other locations in other cities are closed. So, I have to ask my boss about leaving the job early in order to visit a location that is currently opened until 4:00 PM. I have to drive for a hour or longer there which is in Raleigh.

My branch has been closed for 4 months while all the other Banks and Credit Unions have been opened. It\u0027s ridiculous to have a branch in town and not being able to use it. Bank of America doesn\u0027t care about the little people that\u0027s why people leave and go elsewhere.  Credit Unions have proven that during this pandemic they can serve you better than these other banks that say that customers are their most important asset. I will be closing all my accounts and moving on. This bank doesn\u0027t care and why should they. They have big business behind them.

I have a 17 year old son that I wanted to open an account for asked the BANK MANAGER if I could start his account online? She advised that I could. I went online to set up his account and was unable to do so because my son is 17! I set an appointment for 1:00 to meet with a banker I got there about 1:05 let the teller know that I was there for my appointment she states that the banker that I am meeting with is on lunch! So I ask if I need to see a banker to make deposit to my account and request a new debit card(the card that was mailed to me never arrived). I was told yes. So I then ask the same MANAGER if it was ok that I had a 1:00 appointment and the banker was on lunch until 1:30? She then asked me if I was there at 1? No I was about 5 minutes late but if you are not here at exactly 1 then no appointment? She states there is a 15 minute grace period. So, the banker comes back from lunch I hear the manager tell her what I am trying to do and the manager tells me I can go in. The banker then looks at me and says how can I help you? Me: she didn’t tell you? So then she “confirms” what I want to do and then says I don’t have a cash drawer. Okayyyyyyyy, why do you need a cash drawer? Well I can’t take cash to deposit you will have to go to the counter for that. I started at the counter why didn’t she say I can take your deposit but you will have to see the banker to get a new card. No respect for my time at all. Came in with cashiers checks was told by the MANAGER that the funds would be available by 9 in the morning.  By 9 in the morning there was an extended hold placed on the cashiers checks! Why is this necessary for a Cashiers check? So i call the branch and speak with the manager that states she will call me back. When she calls me back she states that she confirmed that the cashiers checks were valid but the bank that they came from has not released the funds. So she can’t release the hold. So you verified that the cashiers checks are valid but you won’t release the hold until the other bank gives you the money???? A cashiers check is guaranteed funds you verified that they are valid but I still have to wait 7-10 days? Do not do business with this bank! I have no idea how the bank manager has yet to give me the correct information. Never apologizes nor try to correct her error!

Everytime I leave the country, I exchange money at the bank. I like to do it in person because I like to ask questions about the rates and to make sure my money is correct. I went into the bank today, the new Clairmont location and Jenae was my teller. When I went to do the exchange, the 1st thing she said was, \u0022Why don\u0027t you do it online?\u0022 When I explained that I would prefer a personal experience, she said \u0022we don\u0027t have access\u0022 1st I thought it was very interesting that NO ONE at the bank had access to order foreign money.

She stated \u0022well, you wouldnt be able to understand unless you work here.\u0022 Now, I have 3 degrees, so I feel like I should be able to wrap my head around what is so different.

Since we did not have complete access to the business checking we decided that 50% would go to his personal account and 50% to my personal account. We were both signers on the loan but when the 50% was deposited in my account it showed his name first, so it grabbed the risk dept attention and I get that , however keep in mind we had already applied for a business checking through BOA we just did not have full access to it. By the time it was approved about 8 days later BOA put a freeze on both of my personal one of which I share with my son who is off to college in another state, now it has been six days more I have no money, food, utilities are turned off because I do not have any cash or any means of getting my money out of my accounts. I have spoke with the fraud dept, I have been to the bank in person, I have sat on hold for hours waiting for services reps.

227,Max Forstag,06/16/2020,1,"Allow me to return the favor, BoA.Allow me to jump aboard the middle finger-to-Bank of America train. Reading all of the other disgusted customer reviews only confirms the suspicion that BoA seems to operate by giving their customers the same treatment.\n\nI purchased a flight/hotel bundle with Expedia back in January, and I made sure to buy the vacation cancellation waiver along with it. When Covid really hit the U.S. hard in early March, I decided to use it to cancel my trip. After many headache-inducing hours on Expedia\u0027s virtual chat, I was able to get the entire refund applied minus the $70 cancellation waiver. \n\nThe hotel refund processed right away. But getting my flight tickets from Alaska Airlines refunded was more cumbersome. I contacted BoA for support and they recommended that I send in a written explanation of the issue along with whatever documentation of the purchase to convince them that I was due a refund. This seemed like an inefficient and antiquated way of handling what seemed a routine customer service issue, but I complied because I wasn\u0027t paying for a trip that I didn\u0027t take! I submitted a 10-page application with all the required documentation and 6 weeks later, I finally received a refund. Case closed, I thought at the time! With everything else happening in life, not being out almost $800 seemed like a big relief.\n\nYet five weeks later, I checked my online BoA account to see that the full amount for the flight tickets appeared back in my account again, inexplicably. I figured another phone call or two might readily fix the problem. Clearly, I underestimated BoA\u0027s ineptitude and unwillingness to help its customers. Like many others, I spent hours on the phone, being transferred from one department to another. I was cycled through Jasmine, Amber, Randy, Manar, and Shontae. I explained my situation to each person, but was then either placed on hold, hung up on, or transferred to another person in the wrong department. No one could help.\n\nLater today I got a letter from BoA telling me that they \u0022could not further investigate my claim.\u0022 The letter did include a mention of consumer protections, but that was empty lip service. Whomever took a cursory glance over my claim did me the favor of taking a screenshot of Alaska’s refund policies, which I had already read and reviewed. Yes, you can apply a vacation waiver to nonrefundable tickets purchased on Expedia, per Kristian, an Expedia customer service rep who helped process my refund.\n\nRealizing that BoA would be of no help, I contacted Alaska Airlines. After explaining the situation to Barry in the refunds department, he advocated on my behalf with the claims department at Alaska and informed me that they would refund the full flight amount back to my BoA card. Incredible. 20 minutes on the phone with one person who works for the vendor requesting payment got me more \u0022consumer protection\u0022 than 3 hours, a half a dozen people on the phone, and 10-pages of written documentation for BoA. The second the charge is credited back to my account I fully plan to pay off the remaining balance and bid BoA farewell permanently. Credit score be damned. This is not how you treat your customers.",,,trustpilot.com

Thought it was a person doing this, but when it happened to my dad at the same date and time ... and then other people from around the area you tend to try and investigate on your own and tend to come to your conclusion. Nevertheless, how they handle such a scandal is why they deserve as many negative stars as possible. I waited 8 hours the first day trying to claim my money , waited the whole day and they didn’t answer. A little discouraging but I had the whole next day. So there I was ... waiting another 7 hours and when I was about to hit the 8th hour they finally answered. For security reasons they canceled my card and sent me another one but they didn’t send the card immediately or even the next day.. 4 days later I receive an email that they barely sent the card and to wait 7-10 business days for the card. All this happened on the days of may 29 through 30 and I had to pay rent on the 1st and I can’t access my money, when going personally to any local Bank of America they say that they are separate from EDD and that I should call EDD instead because they can’t help me.. so I go ahead and call them and guess what i waited another 8 hours and no answer .

234,Sara Rybacki,06/08/2020,1,"DO NOT use Bank of America!Absolutely the worst experience I\u0027ve ever had with a credit card!! Or a company period for that matter! If I could give them a negative star rating, I would. I had autopay set up, as I do with all of my accounts, and it drafted the same, LARGE (over $3000) amount out of my checking account 3 separate occasions. This caused my checking account to be over drafted twice and causing me to incur over draft and line item return charges from my bank (not a Bank of America account). NO ONE was willing to help me resolve this issue that was 0% my or my banks fault. I was finally able to open a case with the dispute team, 2 months later, and after waiting a month for a response was finally told it was my fault that the autopay pulled the amount more than once. I have no idea how they came to that conclusion. I have an excellent credit score with upwards of 13 credit cards, all on autopay, and all paid off every month. I know how things work! I filed an appeal with even more evidence than I sent with the original claim and was told they refused to even review it. I have NEVER had worse customer service in my life and several hour long wait times. I will NEVER use Bank of America for anything again and plan to tell everyone I know to not use their products. They DO NOT give a hoot about their customers. Use Citi, Chase, or Capital One for your credit card and banking needs. They care. But whatever you do, DO NOT use Bank of America!",,,trustpilot.com

Bank of America, for whatever reason, has locked my account.\n\nI have been calling from nice for 3 months and they put me on hold. When I get a person they are not efficient and they either say they can help me or waste my money and time. My account is still in the us because I receive social security which is hard to change. \n\nI have placed a complaint with the Board of Governors of Federal Reserve System - Public Affairs. They are looking into this and told me that they will let me know, but the bottom line is that Bank America is so dedicated to security that they locked our accounts online by deletion of passwords.\n\nLocking our visas results in not having access to my money to buy food and medicine and I really need help. \n\nBanks are security crazy and they are abusing me in two ways. it is expensive to call from Nice, France because they put you on hold for long periods of time. I ask for them to connect with a business account and they wind up again putting me on hold as they switch to another person.\n\nThis is frustrating this  and is why I am angry. If anyone has an idea about how to deal with this it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI depend on my social security to live and the bank does nothing to help! Banks are protected but people are not.

239,Tim,05/27/2020,1,"The must hate their customersI would rather call the DMV or IRS than call Bank of America.  Their customer service is the worst... long hold times, multiple transfers after your call is answered, and absolutely zero accountability or ownership on the part of the agents who \u0022answer\u0022 these calls (I wanted to write \u0022service theses calls\u0022, but that is not what they do.).  Additionally, their mobile app is just terrible.  There is too much emphasis on marketing other products rather than providing a nice UX and easy way to accomplish banking tasks.  Bank of America is easily one of the worst companies for customer experience.  I am convinced it is their strategy, because I avoid calling or contact customer service; I know it will just ruin my day,  I use them for banking because they are big, but I would never get a loan from them or put my retirement savings with Merrill Lynch.  They must train their staff to hate customers, because that is how you feel if you need to talk to them.",,,trustpilot.com

I get a notification on my app I\u0027m at a -888,888.00 balance. When I call the bank I\u0027m told the bank did it for security risk so no one including me can touch the account. Turns out its frozen and due to be closed due to possible check fraud. Come to find out a favor I did for a so called friend turned out to be a bad check. It was never cashed it was returned and I got a 12.00 fee for returned check. I have been told so many lies by over 10 different employees i have spoken to since may 11th till today may 27th. My Bill\u0027s that are debited out of my account are gonna go through, that was a lie. Call in 3 days and will have an answer, that\u0027s was a lie. Request was put in to get my money sent to me that I have in my account, that was a lie. They say they make a note on my account everytime I call, that was a lie. It keeps going on and on. My Bill\u0027s are hounding me and late fees are adding up. When I ask I\u0027m sure late fees will not be paid by bank of America cause they the ones that froze my account and that\u0027s the only truth I get is that they are not responsible for my late fees. I was also told it could take 3 months to resolve the issue. When I asked can anyone call the investigator on my case and they response was there isn\u0027t a number it\u0027s a group of analyst reviewing my account. So if there is an emergency for example a fire they dont have a phone to call 911 there are just gonna sit there. Bank of America is full of it. When I asked so being a customer since 1993 doesn\u0027t mean anything no credit or nothing, all I get is dead silence and then the same crap again that my account is being investigated. What would they do if it happened to them are they not going to go out of their way to resolve their issue or just sit back and listen to the different lies being told by the bank....",,,trustpilot.com

We have never required assistance, have had a positive bank balance, and have never carried any debt.  However, when we tried to file for the COVID 19 payroll protection program to ensure we can avoid having to layoff or furlough hard-working people, BofA summarily denied our request stating we have no previous debt history (we have never had to take a loan).  So, what are we to think?  Does the government approve of a bank who prioritizes customers who have a direct debt risk to BofA ahead of those customers who have stable companies and have the ability to maintain their employees in a time of need?  \n\nIt seems BofA has one interest which is to protect the balance sheet of Bank of America by directing government funds to those companies who carry a loan risk with BofA.

On 3/19/2020 I was a victim of fraud and my account was compromised by someone that I thought was a reputable Company offering me a loan during these troubled times that America is going through. Instead of getting a loan I had all the money I had in the bank stolen and sent out through Zelle and sent to a person that I have no idea of whom they are. I was informed of the fraud by the BOA risk team as they were informing me that they have decided to no longer do business with me. What exactly did I do wrong???? I’m not only in shock by what just happened with the theft of all the money I have at this point but also in how I was treated as a criminal by the bank I’ve been with and been faithful to for years. The next day I call to try and get a resolution when I was told to go into the local bank that I set up the account in so no real help through the hours I was on the phone. I go to the local branch here in Killeen, TX where I reside and although everyone there was super nice and concerned were not able to help me either. I was basically told that my accounts were being shut down and the money that was remaining in the accounts had been frozen. I have ONLY $8.00 to my name and no assistant to get anymore money and I was told there was nothing that could be done. Why would a Bank that I’ve been with for this many years do me like this in my time of serious need???? I literally have nothing at this point. Then I had just gotten paid and they won’t even give me that money. Everything in there bank was mines and I’m the one that worked hard for it and I’m not allowed to have it??? I’m mortified with how I was treated while going through this hardship. Then I was told there may not even be a resolution for possibly 10 days or more. The coronavirus is going around and there is nowhere I can just go into to eat or find things that I need in order to sustain, I have no access to any debit cards to order food or supplies in and to make it worse I am out here with no money!!!! I Haven’t cried So much in my life as I have the last three days. It feels like my whole life and self-awareness has been taken away from me in just a few days. I’m not sure I’ll ever want to put my money that I work hard for Monday thru Friday again in any bank.

When I first joined, they were kind and professional. Customer service was very good. Now they just don\u0027t seem to care about anything other than taking your money from you. Honestly, if you have ANY other options, avoid BofA at all costs.\n\nExample: I can\u0027t ever seem to speak to a phone representative due to their awful computerized answering system. If you manage to get through the maze they put at the start of every phone call, be ready for a wait. Call in the middle of the night? 40 minute wait. Call on a weekend? 40 minute wait. Maybe 9-5 is better, but that\u0027s when I work, so I would have to miss work to call at that time. Local agents are clueless how to help on their credit card accounts and tell you to call the customer service line, and they have no way to skip the wait. BofA, if you care at all about customers, stop worrying so much about making your stockholders profit, and bring some good, old-fashioned American customer service back to your cold-as-ice profit machine. After proceeding through the phone answering system, it wouldn\u0027t surprise me if the poor phone agents are typically berated, which also makes me wonder about the employee\u0027s working conditions.

I kind of felt behind a couple of payment. So bank of America started harassing me. They destroy my credit.i had to borrow the money so that I can pay them.i call to pay the credit limit of the card which was 2500 hundred. At customer service I started talking to Andrew.rigth away andre told me the balance I was suprised to hear that all the time that I was paying. The balance keep raising. Even I was paying when I ask how much money was all together there was 203 dollars more on the balance I ask where does chargers came from. He said late fees ontop of late fees. But that. There was more. So I told him I wanted to talk to the supervisor. Which he got me.hi.s name is mark Sanchez started talking tothis so call supervisor. he was worse than the first one this mark Sanchez even added the fees from today with mark Sanchez the balance got higher. And then another fee that he had to add because some payment process.by the time he was done it was almost 3000dollars and the 3 plus 37 cents. So I ask what happened to the money that I was paying on the balance. It does not matter that you paid. You where behind a couple of payments so the late fees just added up.i got one of those cash rewards cards. So I ask mark Sanchez. How much cash back rewards points do I have mark Sanchez told me that the point went lost because I was a couple of payment late.so I lost them how is that possible. What kind of card is this you pay all the time on time and this is the way a long time customer gets there  rewards. And then you get treated like some kind of lowlife..because you went through a hardship. You would understand that you\u0027re bank would have some kind of humanity. But for bank of America is all about the money. Sorry to say. I call this bank of America customer service and I was laughs at belittle made to be a fool because I wanted to pay of this cash rewards credit card that I did not wanted in the first place we where lied to we wanted a person loan not a credit card.

Mark Sanchez wanted me pay 3 thousand and 3 plus 73 cents and he was not going to close the account because it was to new.i don\u0027t know what that meant. So I told him wanted to talk to somebody else that has a heart. Because mark doesn\u0027t have any kind of humanity. He said he was to get the supervisor that was sitting next to him.her name is Roni and she started talking about the process. Told her I was tired and wouldn\u0027t rather call in the morning. To hopefully pay the credit card with some one that is a real supervisor.i don\u0027t understand that this people want to charge me more money than what I borrow o let me refrease.

349,Dee,01/16/2020,1,"The Most Important Review I’ll Write TodayBank of America is a fundamentally dishonest company. Today many financial industries’ business model is to prey on economically disadvantaged people, but BoA is one of the worst, and time after time, always for a different reason, I personally get to experience it. They hide fees in massive contracts, and implement them without mercy. They place holds on checks indiscriminately, regardless of amount or from where it came, and don’t bother with the inexplicably long hold time, and barely competent, surly attitude the call-room rep will inflict on you, because they will not be able to give you a reason for the hold, or an approximation of when they funds they seized will become available. This has been the case EVERY TIME they’ve “held” a check, and every time, they’ve been wrong. They’ve lied to me about when fees will occur and what those fees will be. Their customer support center ALWAYS, without a single exception has “unusual call volume” (Imagine my shock.) When the best a bank can do is not to technically break the law as they take as much of your money as possible, or “place a hold on your account” ie to borrow as much of your money, at anytime, for any reason, without interest or even your consent, that’s despicable. When the best they can offer a customer is a scripted, meaningless apology for constant mistakes resulting from unchanging, dishonest behavior, it’s safe to say this is a company to be avoided at any and all costs.",,,trustpilot.com

I get between 1-3% cash back on that card and save up around $2500 to transfer to savings accounts.  It\u0027s a great card. \n\nThey have perks if you have large balances with them and you get more money in cash rewards as a bonus, free ATM withdrawals, fee waivers and such.  \n\nBoA is a large bank and has branches everywhere so that is nice when you travel around the USA as I do.  Also, they have deals with sister banks so I have been able to use ATMs without fees while outside of the USA as well on travel. \n\nI have been fortunate to have no major issues with them that require solving and have never had any huge customer service problems with them.  Twice I have been issued new cards due to strange charges and they have caught it before I did and sent me texts to verify purchases.  \n\nI\u0027ve also called their customer service a few times while on travel with issues and have been able to resolve them easily and they\u0027ve taken good care of me to ensure I am able to keep traveling with no issue and use my cards. \n\nThe website is easy to use and you can put in travel notices and verify purchases.

358,JP Garces-Voisenat,01/04/2020,1,"Only for very rich peopleI started as a Fleet customer back in 2000. It was a great regional bank that was unfortunately absorbed by Bank of America. The level of customer service of BofA got increasingly more deficient with the years, to the point of being reduced to a minimal expression today. The waiting times in their mandatory transaction telephone lines are appalling. Some three years ago, when my checking account balance was more than 50K, due to my level of savings, they practically forced me to change to an interest-bearing account, arguing that I was \u0022losing money\u0022. On average, they paid me a meagre interest of about 3 cents on 30K. They always addressed me opportunistically as their \u0022most valued customer\u0022 (no wonder because they profited tremendously from my money balances). In recent months my money balances fell sharply to amounts well below 10K because I became unemployed. Instead of transferring me to my old non-interest-bearing account, they suddenly decided to start charging me a monthly service fee of 25 dollars. It is absolutely ludicrous! They have charged me in one month like 200 times more than all the accumulated interest they gave me. Outraged as I am, I have decided to close my bank account. But it was not enough to go personally to a branch to do the whole operation. They gave me one of their special numbers (which was constantly busy) to do another operation to close my credit card and travel card. I had to find another number online. I called and after waiting for half an hour on the line, the associate asked me how could he provide me an “excellent service”.

361,Vanessa Van Schoick,01/02/2020,2,Not a fan of BOAI was a customer at BOA for about 15 years. I recently left BOA when they would not reimburse fraud on my debit card. After I did some research I realized that I would get more perks at another Bank and switched. The CC I still have with BOA is my oldest account so I have kept that for credit score purposes for now. The two credit cards I got from Chase are far more generous with the rewards. I use my credit cards to build credit by monthly making purchases and paying them in a timely manner. I just got another 90 dollar Amazon gift card from Chase for paying off my monthly charges. BOA may have cards with better perks but my CC does not have any worthwhile perks in my opinion because 5-10% off is usually not enough to feel like I am saving.,,,trustpilot.com

While I expected a hold of some of the funds, I did not expect a hold on all $5,000. I have deposited personal checks at the same ATM and the funds were immediately released. According to FDIC policies, this practice is against federal law. My guess is that Bank of America holds the funds in order to gain interest. It does not take 12 days to verify a cashier\u0027s check. With today\u0027s technology, it\u0027s just a matter of either calling the issuer or using the database to search for the amount. I do not recommend Bank of America. How is it that a financial institution insured by the FDIC holds funds from another FDIC institution for an extended length of time. Below are the policies:\nBanks must post or provide a notice at each ATM location that funds deposited in the ATM may not be available for immediate withdrawal.\nIf a bank makes funds from deposits at an ATM it doesn’t own available for withdrawal later than funds from deposits at an ATM it does own, it must provide a description of how the customer can tell the difference between the two ATMs.\nIf you deposit money in an ATM that isn’t owned by your bank, the funds must be available for withdrawal not later than the fifth business day following the banking day on which the funds are deposited.\nFunds deposited at an ATM that is not on or within 50 feet of the premises of the bank are considered deposited on the day funds are removed from the ATM, if funds are not normally removed from the ATM more than two times each week.\nA bank that operates an off-premises ATM from which deposits are not removed more than two times each week must disclose at or on the ATM the days on which deposits made at the ATM will be considered received.\nFunds deposited at a staffed facility, ATM or contractual branch are considered deposited when they are received at the staffed facility, ATM or contractual branch.",,,trustpilot.com

373,Christina Helm,12/10/2019,1,"Elder Abuse at its FinestAge can be a cruel partner, especially when dealing with Bank Of America. Is there a Support of Elder Abuse clause written in the handbook for aspiring employees? \n\nI have had to endure the endless avenues of deception that seem to be common practice in deflecting responsibility in the banks wrongdoing. I am not even sure where to start, the list is as long Tolstoy’s War and peace has pages, or the last two years of my life (this started in April 2017). \n\nSo i think a few characteristic excerpts will give you a fine idea… \n\nMy Mother, suffering the devastating loss of her husband (who managed the household and all the bills) and rendered incapable of making any sort of financial decisions due to the advanced stage of Dementia and a brain tumor had all of her Social Security Monies stolen via fraudulently written checks.  \n\nAs I awaited for doctors letters to activate my POA, My mothers checks were stolen and I went into the bank and asked them to freeze her account, not to take out money, not to see a balance just to report that I knew there was Fraud being committed and the monies that were disappearing was all my mothers Social Security Benefits.   I met with two different Bank executives, both of which did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!  \n\nI was ignored, my report ignored and the fraudulent abuse went on depleting the remaining funds of a dying woman. Later on it became clear that Bank of America is a band of unethical thieves, with zero accountability and for the most part supported an evil act of Elder Abuse.  \n\nAnd this my friends is when the fun really started. BOA clearly had no intention of paying my claim, hearing the facts or acknowledging their mistake, they played it off on another departments lack of responsibility and was kicked down the hallway to yet another department, over and over.\n\nIt doesn’t take much to understand that there is a certain technique of avoidance to wear the violated customer down. I had to prove my eligibility of being a POA, then as a Trustee, which they would not accept because they wanted me to Probate the Estate which under California Probate Code #13100 - 13115, there was no need for that.  I then sent medical records that stated that my mother was incapacitated for 5 years, her brain surgeon noted that she had been unable to deal with finances or write checks for this whole time period.   BofA, then said it was her signature, on dates that she was in the hospital having brain surgery…  Shall we all just let that sink in.  In order to send BofA these documents you need to fax them not email.  In the 21st century… email still sounds futuristic in the halls of the mighty BOA. \n\nThey take 48hours to be logged and acknowledged. When checking in to make sure that the fax had been received in the appropriate department they could not be located and the request to resend the 100 plus page document was repeated (4 times). \n\n…Well, how often can one fax a telephone book without growing resentful?\n\nI have asked for accounting and statements, which has been ignored repeatedly.  I cannot tell you how disgusting BofA is to harm an incapacitated human living her desolate without money and never even attempting to get to the bottom of the claim - on a different note the perpetrators are being prosecuted for this crime - the police seemed to figure it out, but still BofA is in denial.",,,trustpilot.com

382,MShah,11/30/2019,1,"Worst Bank I Have Ever Used!Bank of America\u0027s customer service and feature set have been absolutely appalling over the 8+ years that I have been with the bank. They have constantly changed account standings, settings, and issue fees even though my account was well above the threshold for these. This required me to have a monthly call with BoA to get them to refund the fees and each time I was told that it would not happen in the future but that it is the \u0022systems call\u0022 whether or not changes and fees are issued; in other words, you will be charged a fee regardless of whether or not your account meets the minimum requirements for the fees to be waived. It seems that the \u0022system\u0022 does this simply to be an inconvenience to you - each time I called the BoA customer service I have had to wait 15+ minutes on the phone and the callback feature does not work often either. \n\nI also have a Small Business Account with BoA; again, it more than meets the minimum requirements for all fees to be waived, yet each month I am charged a fee which I have to call to get reimbursed. I have made in-person meetings at my local branch, and while the agents have been very helpful, it seems that they don\u0027t entirely know how the BoA system works. This is surprising as they were unable to answer some of my basic questions, including why the system charges fees when the account is above the threshold. \n\nOverall, after 8+ years I have had enough of poor customer service where each agent says something different and seemingly no one understands how the system works and I have had enough of a broken system that charges its users fees regardless of whether or not they meet the threshold for the fees to be waived. Since I will be leaving BoA, I will be pulling my Small Business Account and have also had my partners and employees switch to the other bank where our Small Business Account moved to.

If BOA could float tens of millions without any consequence, and take on overdrawn fees in the interim, they would stand to make millions annually.

When I told her, she said she could not help me and that all she could do was take me to an office and dial a number for me.  I asked if she could stay with me until I reached the proper person, and she so much as said it would be a waste of her time.

However if you ever actually get money on the card from a dead beat parent, that is issued through bofa on contract with AZ state child support, you’re screwed. So finally there’s $80 to use and tried to pump gas with only $20 of it and not only does it decline but it then empties all the funds and holds it to make interest profits from your money for 72 hours before putting the money back on the card even though I cancelled the fuel purchase, it still drained the card for the next 3-4 days!!!!\nThen when ya call them to request someone with authority to remedy not only do you get the lamest excuse ever and a run around answer that if I were to go back to the gas station and if I could even talk the agent there into signing a statement saying the purchase was cancelled and get them to print proof then run somewhere else to fax that and a few other requirements they lost me on then maybe it could get replenished a day sooner??? Holy crap man WTH!!!!!??? And then when you ask to speak to someone that’s for real in charge they put you on hold for 20 minutes and then hang up on you and of course don’t call back so you get to run through their automation nation garbage all over from the beginning again. Or you can just bend over and wait which is their expectation. They should have to replace your funds with whatever interest rates they gain on your funds in that time period because there is no excuse to hold every penny on that card or $80 of it for 3 days on a cancelled $20 purchase of any kind gas or not. All that with no warning.\nHELLO BOFA THATS CALLED THEFT.\nBetween BofA, chase and Wells Fargo I’ve never understood how their corporate mission mentality is, “welcome to most banks where we go out of our way to make banking with us as jammed up and difficult as possible, where we will stick it to you any and every chance we can get, where we don’t care who’s fault it is we’ll still stick it to you somehow and just hang up on ya when ya catch on to our extremely unforgiving, one way, greedy, profit only practices.

I am in the DFW area, and have tried branches throughout Dallas, Richardson and Plano, and see endless lines of people waiting for their few minutes to consult with a banker.  Shame on the 3rd largest bank in US for being so cheap that they continue to limit the staff, locations, and branches that have agents in house to assist. It is obvious that BoA would prefer customers to do everything online, without assistance.

And it keeps on and on with the unbelievable stuff happening.\n\nLast week match.com charged my card for the 3rd months after i try cancelling on the 2nd month and they charged it regardless. Then i called the bank but the bank just was on the phone but didnt do anything to stop the charges. The 3rd time match.com charged again i called them and the bank tellers were telling me that i complaint too much and because of that my account will b closed. \n\nI said to those tellers ( 3 of them because i had to hang up and talk to someone else when the first social case answered me). I said clearly:\u0022 i did not authorise you or any teller or this bank at no point to close my account based of your judgement. You are my bank. Do your job and do not make decisions for me based on your like and dislike of my complaint level. You are soooo unprofessional, arrogant and incorrect. How dare are you negating my experience and how you think you are doing your job as a bank.\u0022. I felt so mad and disrespected by this bank and its no good tellers that answered my app call. \n\nNO GOOD when it comes to getting phone help. It really feels like someone when to a mental hospital and said:\u0022 u look well!  You look well! Come with me! You are hired! Nothing wrong with being sick. If you are you are. Get well. Dont attack my life and my being through a bank system. You truly no good who ever you are.\n\nI cannot begin to tell the amount of unbelievable comments these tellers think they can tell to the customers or may be just me. It has to be. This cannot be a business here! If they do what i experienced to everyone for real this bank would no be operating a year total. And its been around so im assuming this is specially targeted to me.\n\nI explained to teller what i authorized you was to get me back my money someone try to steal by telling me something and doing something else. It s not a contract but a trial. I tried i didnt like. Willingly paid a month, camcelled and then keep 1month, 2 months charging so no! \n\nThese tellers were definitely not normal people. They were so professionally off. They had no idea  how to professionalky help a customer. The 3rd one was literally acting like a kid repeating something on top of me like i win you loose game you play with a five years old and being overtalked. I m thinking in the back of my head: \u0022Who the hell hired and trained the 1st and 3rd person i spoke to?\u0022 \n\nThe 1st and 2nd phone rep definitely should be fired and not work in customer servive. The 3rd one was confirming agressively that he will close my account for complaining.  \n\nDid they even listen to themselves to be threatening a customer to close their account because they have complained 1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 he counted over the phone!!! Are you kidding me??? I regretted right at that moment using this bank for a decade and running my cards with them for 2500 to 5000 a month in small transactions.\n\nWho says such thing to your customer even if someone tells u to say it, u should not. And i surely will not be quiet just because u want me to not talk about a thief of my money or fear complaining because you may close my account. \u0022I will sue you if you do\u0022 was what i said to this 3rd aggressive and disrespectful teller and all the other 2. Im even wondering if you are working with the thieves im complaining about. Is there a back end transaction stealing program by reps or the bank at this bank of america. You surely are not acting normal at all about my money being taken by a merchant. Whom even if u think i complained i ve called the bank twice for it already so it should have been stopped first time. Are you facilitating the subscription robery now! Why else would u act as such. Are you a rep for the bank who should represent the customer but clearly you were not and seem to defend the merchant who took my money 3rd times without stopping! So i complaint to bank to return my charge the 2nd time but they let the 3rd charge happen. Now i think even more this is on purpose.\n \nIf i wasn\u0027t clear before im clear by calling and complaining of the charge the 3rd time. Why the 3rd charge after a 2nd complaint? Was your job to ignore my complaints!?\n\n In the meantime i work very hard. I have no one who helps me and you want to take my hard working money and sush me. No BOA. \n\nSo fast foward i received a voicemail threat to attack my social AFTER THAT 3RD TELLER CRAZY INTER ACTION and few days later some dude Devin from Newark Delaware answer my call after the bank said to call from my bank of america  app. ( same name as the yelp dude who call me that morning too. They also use the code BOA. How they steal my business mony taking from my account to yelp advertising to advertise my business and steal the leads).  This dude was acting like he was trying to see how naive i was or not. He seemed to be doing something he wasnt supposed to. He was like this call is recorded and then was worried someone else was listening to our conversation. Its recorded you said. Someonevwill listen to it!  Why would you worry someones hearing what your disrespectful judgemental and crazym saying to me??? You know you are crossing your boundaries beyong and not doing what you are supp He said a check was deposited.  ts not me but its supposed to be my fiancee. But i dont take checks. Just wire transfer. So there its a lie. Basically they were doing what they said the following week. Closing your account for not doing their jobs and me complaining when they didnt. Reminder i used them for over a decade and never did them wrong. Out of all those year, they disrespect you for 8 uber complaints ( we all know how uber doesnt show sometimes and mess ur money up). There were 8 complaints she said out of 8000 times of using my card and $900 a month uber. Do you even know math as a banker? Aparrently not! Your focus and disrespect show it.\n\nIm a business owner. I made something great but crooks in Newark NJ wanted it. I said no. They send men to seduce me so they can access the bank assets and i rip their heart out each time and feed it to the evil queen alter ego of mine and send them back to the darkness they come from lol. Now the question is the disciple they have when doing shady violations in bank do i eat their hearts out too? Are they complices or just innocent people being duped by these newark delaware people trying to steal my stuff?  This is the big question👸 Ill find out soon. Those tellers were not normal. They were sooo off and saying things a bank doesnt say but people who work for 3rd party would. Its like when the nigerian scammers call to intimidate you about your information. Its stupid.\n\nThey think i dont know whats going on. I ride with the happening to see where it goes and determine the source of the problem. Few people in Deleware and Newark who have the nerve to try claiming what i made, designed and created from scratch working 19hrs a day for decades, paying for school, bills and holding 2 jobs was also what i did to be able to make my company until it comes to life. And now these lazy bratzs dare to want to scoop the benefits. If you think messing with my bank account or having uncompetent or crazy people in a bank will help you access my assets be sure i will sue u til the end of time and drag u to the mud newark. Why? because its mine. Not yours. Its my make, my idea, my compay and my money. I dont care what trick u try to use to get a hold of my things but know when u do ill roar and its going to be fierce. \n\nDevin from deleware your bank you work for and who ever just violated the human rights i did not authorize you to touch my account or to do the things you try on it. I have told you multiple time outloud over the pgone when u were acting all crazy about clising my account as those 3 morons tellers said you guys will do not to. I dont know who you think you are or who you think you are dealing with but im very on top of whats do e to me. When you are doing something if you dont want your tricks revealed do not do them to me. Period.\n\nSo bank of america theatens its correct customers that is witch hunted by a group who do not like them or envy them for whatever reason( my case is arrogant and jaleous bratzs who want what i made and i wont give it to them ever) and they have corrupted workers in the company  associating with those who dont like your being or want to control it and you dont let them ( they suck and u cant let suck run you. Look where it leads and thats with damage control) violate your privacy or run a program that includes shutting down your bank account because they want to limit you from accessing your own infrastructure you designed and they want to have and if you dont give it to them they ll still it. Hard no!\n\nWell this is the wrong person. Everything is clear and step by step demonstrable. I keep receipts and my name is Karma.  \n\nYou just been swished. I m coming for you the group of arrogant corrupted disgraceful lying cheating fake reps ( playing pshycologist when i did not authorize your doctor evaluation or hire you for medical reasons.

415,Elena F.,08/19/2019,1,"Mortgage and securities fraud, Note forgery, identity theftMortgage and securities fraud, Note forgery, robo-signing, identity thefts, unlawful collection, unjust enrichment - all business as usual.\n\nI am a victim of a RICO enterprise operated by Bank of America though its sham conduits like Caliber Home Loans, Inc., PennyMac Loan Services (fka Countrywide Financial) - with full support from Black Knight, Inc (owned by Fidelity National Finances)\n\nBOA uses third parties like Caliber and PennyMac  to defraud borrowers like myself, internally defaulted my loan, stole my identity, forged my Note, unjustly enriched themselves and now threaten me with foreclosure while my loan is not in default (although BOA defaulted it in its bookkeeping records to fraudulently remove from Ginnie Mae pool. \n\nBAO makes huge profits, about $20 per $1, even before you start to amortize your loan, by secretly trading on borrowers names, signatures and reputation on the open market without my knowledge and consent. All my payments do not benefit investors but solely create a handsome income for BOA. \n\nBOA also uses services from a well-known document foregery facility Black Knight  who helps BOA to defraud borrowers. \n\nIn my situation Black Knight ordered a Map from FEMA to place bogus flood insurance on my property which not in the Flood zone (I suspect this insurance was result of kickbacks)\n\nLater Black Knight sent to fake \u0022Servicer\u0022 PennyMac a pile of my closing documents with a copy of my Promissory Note and a poorly forged Allonge signed by some Collateral Shipper Jordan Lune who assigned my loan to Caliber on the same closing day; and whose electronic signature is a text-book evidence of modern robo-signing and forgery.\n\nNeither Caliber or PennyMac never had any of my loan documents and never processed any payments. They merely got a password to Black Knight database (known as \u0022boarding\u0022) and posed as \u0022Servicers\u0022 to defraud borrowers about who is a real party who collects payments - BOA.\n\nAnyone who knows about foreclosure litigation and securitization of residential debt knows that the only way the banks could succeed is if they had a central repository and central command center from which all documents were fabricated and all instructions were issued.\n\nFor nearly all loans the central command was Lender Processing Systems, aided by DOCX. While DOCX is technically defunct and Loraine Brown went to jail taking one for the team, the functions of LPS remained the same.\n\nLPS changed its name to Black Knight and in a PR coup transformed itself into the publisher of what is largely viewed as comprehensive data on mortgage lending and foreclosures.\n\nHence it went from the purveyor of false, fraudulent, forged documentation to the purveyor of data perceived as reliable and thence became a trusted source whose data is considered worthy of legal presumptions.\n\nSystems at LPS/Black Knight include data processing on virtually all residential loans subject to claims of securitization many of which are represented by data on the MERS Platform which is a workaround to hide separate split transfers of the debt, the note and the mortgage or deed of trust.\n\nThe systems on LPS/Black Knight are designed for the the express purpose of presenting consistent data in foreclosure claims. As such it also enables the rotation of apparent servicers, none of whom perform bookkeeping functions even if some of them interact with borrowers as if they were actually the servicers.\n\nThe rotation of servicers comes with the false representation and illusion of boarding in which the process is falsely represented as meaning that the new servicer inspected, audited, reviewed and input the data into their own system. None of that occurred. Instead the new servicer merely gained access to the same LPS system as the last servicer with a new login and password.\n\nAll evidence shows that the functions for fabricated, forging and robosigning documents continue to be performed under the direction of LPS/Black Knight which receives all instructions from various investment banks who have each started their own securitization scheme masking apparent trades in the secondary market for loans and trades in the shadow banking market where “private contracts” are regularly traded without any securities regulation.\n\nFar from dropping their connection with LPS/DOCX the major banks have completely embraced this central repository of all loan data, all of which is subject to manual and algorithmic manipulation to suit the needs of the banks; thus they produce a report that creates the illusion of credibility, reliability and even independence even though none of those things are true.\n\nSo now U.S. Bank is further embracing LPS/Black Knight technology in the form of “Empower” for loan originations. U.S. bank is of course the major player whose name is used in foreclosures despite the fact that it has no interest in the loans and does not receive one cent from foreclosure sales of property. It merely receives a royalty for the use of its name as part of a fictitious name of a nonexistent trust which is falsely represented to have engaged in a transaction in which the trust acquired the debt, note and mortgage on multiple loans.\n\nThis deal furthers the PR myth. It strengthens Black Knight as having the attributes of a legitimate player when in fact it is a central figure in the greatest economic crime in human history.\nResearch made by lawyer Neil Garfield whose blog is Living Lies",,,trustpilot.com

Worst customer experience I have had ever. \n\nShe demands your credit card information (full 16 digits, expiration date and security code) sent over text or email before anything else (vs other lenders would send you a link to security pay for appraisal online). She texted \u0022so I can use it to shop online\u0022.

The last sentence she said got me shocked and almost wondering if I was dealing with a romantic relationship rather than trying to get a loan (this is a joke).\n\nRegardlessly, super frustrated and disappointed.

Recently we made a mistake of shopping at a local business that we have had bad experiences at before. We were purchasing hay for our horses which in our state there is no sales tax. This ripoff business insists on charging sales tax. When they would not refund the tax we told them to cancel the order while we were still there at the counter. They refused to do either stating there are no refunds on feed....which is not posted anywhere on the premises.\n\n1)  We had a choice of taking the hay and accept being defrauded....not an option.\n\n2) We could have refused to leave without a refund and possibly be arrested.....not an option.\n\n3) We could refuse to take possession of the hay and dispute the charges on our card.\n\nWe did #3. BOA did not even give our dispute credence because they said we \u0027abandoned\u0027 the merchandise and it was a legitimate charge we authorized. Of course we authorized it until they put illegal sales tax on the purchase.\n\nBOA caused us to be victimized twice. We have exemplary credit and put every single thing we buy on a card every month and pay off the balance at the end of each month. We have since acquired another bank credit card and will no longer use BOA for any purchases. We are also considering moving all of our savings to another major bank as well. Why be loyal to a business who couldn\u0027t care less about you!,,,trustpilot.com

They used some Nigerian payment site (wasn\u0027t aware of the origin of ePay) and didn\u0027t know until the ePay site kept refusing my credit card. I then googled ePay and Sinemia and found out what they were. I thought the payment hadn\u0027t gone through as I got no confirmation notice right away. A few days later Sinemia let me know they had my payment and to sign up with their app. I checked BOA online and found I had been charged the annual fee. I disputed that with BOA and initially they credited the fee back. About a month later I got a letter in the mail that they had received information from Sinemia about the transaction and they felt it was a legitimate charge and put it back on my account. They never told me what info they based their decision on and didn\u0027t even give me time to reply which could only be by letter. The kicker was that the day I got the letter was the last day to reply. BOA even closed my account (after 13 years) and lied that I asked to have it closed in a complaint to the feds!

429,Alexander Mizeu,03/15/2019,1,"A terrible and completely dishonest bank,which simply brazenly deceives peopleSo I will tell from my experience. Bank of America - it\u0027s just the most terrible and disgusting bank in the US, which I only know !!!\nI have been a customer of this bank for almost two years. I had a business account and a personal account (there was a debit and credit card).\nAfter my closing, I was told at the bank that I should not owe anything to the bank, that is, even the bank would owe me some cents. An employee on the phone told me then that these cents would be mailed to me in the form of a paper check.\nFurther, I just forgot about it and knew that I should receive a check on my mail.\nThen after a while I saw a letter on my e-mail stating that I have outstanding debts. I did not respond to this letter, because I decided that it was some kind of mistake.\nAfter several months, I looked into my folder again - spam in my email inbox (and after closing my account in the bank, I unsubscribed from mailings that came to my postal address from the Bank of America).\nAnd I saw that the amount of my debt increased from about $ 1.50 to $ 6, and then $ 8.\nI went and closed the amount of my debt.\nThen a few months later, I again had the amount of debt, and as a result, it grew to $ 11 .. I also did not immediately respond to this ..\nAnd in the end I went to the Bank of America itself to figure out and find out why this is happening!\nI was at the Bank of America near Sheepshead Bay Road. There, I explained everything and explained in detail what happened after my credit card (personal account) was closed.\nIn the Bank of America, an employee is a woman, she made a phone call and immediately spoke a little herself, and then sat me at a separate table with a phone and I started talking to the bank employees on the phone.\nAs a result, after talking with the employee on the phone for a long time, I explained everything to him (it was a man), to which he replied to me that they say, close this amount last time, and he told me the amount a little more than I had on my email..\nThe amount was $ 12.02 - this is the amount he assured me and began to convince the latter with all the hidden interest (commissions). In a word, everything, there will be no more charges in my address !!!\nWell, I agreed and asked 10 times this employee that this is 100% my last payment, I even asked his name and wrote it down to myself.\nAfter that, I went to another Bank of America, which is located on Kings Highway and made the final payment at the checkout there, so I paid the amount of: $ 12.02. I was accordingly given a bank receipt of payment for this amount.\nI sighed everything and thought that I had already closed this question completely and now I should forget about it.\nMarch 14, 2019, about a month after I repaid the debt, I decided to go to the spam folder in my email and what I saw there ..\nThe Bank of America sent me a letter again in the mail saying that I owed the bank an amount of $ 1.42 cents (arrears on my credit card).\nAnd it was absolutely not funny for me !!! I immediately called by phone that I had at the Bank of America on the hotline phone number (800) 421-2110. I was connected with a man. I told him everything abbreviated, that I closed my account (closed my credit card) - October 9, 2018 and so on ...\nThen he answered me that he already knew that I was calling him on this issue. He told me that he would cancel this amount and I would not owe anything.\nI asked this employee to send me a written confirmation that I do not have any debts to the Bank of America at my home address.\nI called him in the evening, somewhere around 10:30 pm. He told me that he would send a letter to my home address and asked for my home address.\nA terrible and completely dishonest bank, which simply brazenly deceives people who were in the past clients of this bank!!!",,,trustpilot.com

This not me blaming them for that. My complaint comes from how they choose to reply in regards to the other entity. I’ve been in contact with both sides and get nothing more than the run around. I expected as much from the other side of the issue but not my bank. The only thing I was looking for was a request to expedite a response so I can recover my wife’s money because the issue was never with her but since the account is joint she was dragged into this. It’s well within their power to provide a reply but they’re content with taking the full 30 days so that they can rack up the fees that are going to take place between now and then. You’d think that if they wanted to help their customer they’d have something set up for this. Even if there were a small fee involved at the very least their customer could have resolution to a very difficult situation.

It\u0027s not their fault. It\u0027s nobody who designed the system taking time to do a test and see how easy or impossible it is for normal people to navigate the autopay system for B of A credit cards.  If B of A were a new bank, a smaller bank, etc, I wouldn\u0027t be so frustrated, but ya know, they\u0027re not new or small, they\u0027re BANK OF AMERICA\n\nThis review has to deal with their autopay/recurring payments system...still not sure what they mean by recurring payments. Anyway,  I have a good number of credit cards with various banks, all of which I immediately put on autopay, paying the full balance every month.  Never have I had anywhere close to the level of difficulty, confusion, frustration and amount of time invested to have things run smoothly as I have had to put into my account with B of A. \n\nWe setup autopay last Spring, but then we discovered payments had not been made on time and had incurred overdue fees and interest on those unpaid bills as a result.  But why weren\u0027t we monitoring more closely? We also didn\u0027t receive our paper bills like we should have and no emails were sent about overdue payments until a month later.  Life is too crazy and hectic to monitor everything all the time -- that\u0027s why we setup autopay - so we can think less about one aspect of life...ya just can\u0027t auto-feed babies or by-pass spending time with them, doing dishes, cleaning the house.\n\nToday, the agent I was transferred to for online account access issues was totally flummoxed as to how to setup autopay.  We ended up exploring together through screen share the different tabs, trying to interpret the language used and find something that gave us clarity about whether autopay was really setup.\n\nSome quotable quotes from him:\n“They make it nearly impossible as they always update this…something I learned two weeks ago doesn’t work anymore”\n\u0022WHY IS THIS IMPOSSIBLE?” after 25 minutes on the phone\n\u0022They could word it better to be honest\u0022\n\nHe was doing his best - extremely kind and determined to help me resolve the issue.  But as he stated -- things get changed frequently, and it seems like those updates and the necessary training are not passed down so that agents can be helpful,  let alone customers being able to navigate things on their own. Is it any wonder customers are confused when the B of A employees don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on?  \n\nB of A may be wonderful in every other way, but I can\u0027t give them a better review with how this has all played out so far.",,,trustpilot.com

We were not behind yet, but we wanted to communicate to our lenders about our situation.  We had heard about HARP, and other mortgage assistance programs, so we contacted BofA.\n\nWe were told by the person on the phone that they couldn\u0027t help us until we were behind on our mortgage.  \u0022Miss a payment or two, then call us back,\u0022 were here exact words.  We did NOT take this advice.  Later, I got another job, and we were able to get back on track.\n\nLater, I spoke to a work colleague in a similar situation.  Now this guy was one of those \u0022deep researchers\u0022 who doesn\u0027t let go of a subject until he digs up everything.  He discovered that Bank of America was not, in fact, our mortgage holder.  This was the time when Wall Street was turning mass numbers of mortgages into securities for the stock market (we all know how THAT went...). Bank of America was, in fact, a loan SERVICER, not the mortgage holder.  They received a percentage of proceeds when mortgage payments were made - when the account was current.  However, if that same payment was made on an account that was behind on their payment, BofA received FIVE TIMES the percentage!  They were literally telling people to go late on their payments so they could boost their own bottom line!!  \n\nI also later found out that the HARP program through BofA had a 99 percent rejection rate!!! So the master plan was, get people late on their mortgage, run them through the HARP red tape for a few months, deny their claim, then foreclose on them!\n\nWHY HAS NO BofA EXECUTIVE BEEN ARRESTED OR GONE TO JAIL FOR THIS??",,,trustpilot.com

Since I travel quite a bit, BoA was handy for me.  However, I hate to think how much money I have lost by banking at BoA....They must be the most predatory bank in the country, charging for anything they can find to charge.  They take 3 days to include a wired deposit and use the time to toss \u0022over-draft\u0022 charges in the account; they have lost deposits I have made (fortunately I always keep the deposit slip); they are very difficult about connecting with Quicken...so many irritating things.  I guess that is why the personnel are extra friendly...Do not bank with this bank.  I am now with PNC and have found a totally different attitude....PNC has bent over backwards to be helpful.",,,trustpilot.com
