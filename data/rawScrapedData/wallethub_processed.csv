They will then hold your money from you until you receive a cashiers check a week later.. they've trained their minions to give you the same robotic answer over and over and over when you ask for answers.. things like ""no further information at this time"" or ""it was a business decision on the end of bank of america"" its ridiculous.. im now stuck trying to run a business with no access to any money for the next 5-7 business days and bank of america is giving me no answers.. and apparently many of my entrepreneur friends have had the same issue!!

When the pandemic (Covid-19) hit. Bank of America was there to only tell me, that this is a business (Erica Solution Supervisor) she went on to tell me that they have to protect themselves. I was hurt, blown away and lost for words. I have been a customer of Bank of America, for over 13 years. Also, to be advised that I would have to run my credit again, in order for them to assist me. I couldn't believe it! All I can say is, is that I'm disappointed in how I was treated! Loyalty means nothing to Bank of America, when times are hard. You are only a Valued Customer.

HOWEVER, I am not convinced ANY real people work there. Calling and trying to talk to a human is nearly impossible and extremely frustrating. If you ask for a human, it says no. Then after going a couple of rounds with the AI, it gives up and sends you to a representative, which is great, but be warned, the AI will be talking in your ear the ENTIRE time. Every few seconds it tries to get you to hang up with something like ""for more information on [insert topic here] press 1.""

When I first started working, I set up an account first with a local bank but was not happy with their online access. So, I canceled my account with them and set up at BoA. Every time I have had a problem, they have resolved it quickly. When I have asked for an allowance for an over draw, they have worked with me on the issue. It has always been a delight banking with them. They talk to me respectfully and even just talk without just trying to get me off the phone or out of their face as quick as possible. I've had a decent conversation with them as the computers processed my request. They are always willing to work with me no matter the issue.

I went to few branches and their customer service was awful. One time I had few charges from them and I wanted to clarify it but they couldn't figure out how I got the charges nor would they return them. One time I had a scammer who was taking money from my account and I asked them to trace it but they couldn't even do that form. At that moment I got fed up and decided to change the bank.

15,Devin Joseph Parada,2012-07-25,4,This is a decent card. I got this card my senior year of college and it seemed to work just fine for my needs. I enjoy being able to transfer funds from my bank to my credit card form my checking account via my mobile banking app on my smartphone. It allows me to build credit so when I am out of college I can get an apartment or something. Although I do believe that it needs a grace period because it is made for students trying to build credit. Another criticism I have about this card is that the rates are too high for it being a card for students.,Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,7,25,16,1,2

The card was really nice for me to build credit. I first used it to make a couple small purchases and I was able to pay the bills on time. After a few months of this, I had a decent credit score.

As long as you use it every month and pay it off, you don't really have to worry about the interest. Bank of America has been very helpful and it's always easy to contact someone if I have any questions. Their website makes it SUPER easy to view everything related to my card. I highly recommend this for students just starting out with credit, but remember- PAY IT OFF EVERY MONTH and don't think it gives you money, you're just BORROWING money!",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,7,25,18,1,2

There is no need to deal with possible human error; everything is clean and simple. I will say that there is not any real incentive to having this card besides its simplicity and decent rates. There is no substantial reward system in place for choosing this card over competitor’s cards.

Since I have a Bank of America account, I usually transfer my rewards directly to my Bank of America account to get the bonus. I use it for my normal purchases and pay it off right away so it's nice to get bonuses for my normal use. Plus, I prefer to use this card over my debit card in case of fraud, I would rather have to deal with getting the charges reversed on the credit card than having to worry about the money in my checking account being used and having to get that reimbursed.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,7,25,20,1,2
20,Michael L Wax Mr,2012-06-19,4,"Bank of America in my opinion is one of the best banks when you compare them with other big banks. Personally I find it convenient that there is a large network of branches and ATM machines. It is very easy to access your funds. I also like to take advantage of the free online money management software called Bank of America My Portfolio. Bill payments and checking are free and there is no minimum balance required. And since I like talking on the phone I can really appreciate the live phone support which is available 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. The only feature I am not comfortable with is the $2 fee for using an ATM that is not a part of the Bank of America network.

21,Jackie Strouble,2012-06-18,2,"When I needed to buy a reliable, fuel-efficient car to make the hour commute to night school, I naturally went to my bank to ask about a loan. I had found a very nice used car FSBO – a Honda Accord wagon, fully loaded, in excellent condition, with 96K miles. It really was a peach of a car! But I was a few thousand $$ short. I went to B of A and asked to see a loan officer. He was summoned and emerged from his office in the back. I was not invited into his office, nor was I offered a chair. We stood in the entrance to a hallway and he asked what I needed. I told him about the car, the amount of money I had for a down payment, and the amount of money I needed to borrow. He barely glanced at me as he said, “We don’t make loans in such small amounts. I suggest you put the purchase on your credit card.” Then he excused himself and walked away. ?!! I’m 50 something and female. I had an excellent credit record (partly because I’m not stupid enough to use my credit card to buy a car), a modest but steady income, and a substantial down payment. But he couldn’t be bothered with such small potatoes, leaving me to wonder “Just who is serving whom here?” A short time later our nation witnessed the collapse of the financial sector and the phrase “too big to fail” entered our public consciousness. My experience taught me that B of A regarded itself as very big and important and regarded me, their long-time customer, as very small and unimportant. Maybe if the banks had followed my kind of money instead of riding the tail of the comet and getting badly burned, the economy would be in much better shape today!",Bank of America Car Loans,wallethub.com,female,6,18,22,1,0
22,Reina,2012-06-18,1,"I had been a customer with BofA for a long time. I remember in the 90's when the bank representatives went to my school to get the students set up with their own bank accounts. That was almost two decades ago. When the economy was good, I was one of their best customers. Despite the fact that I wasn't rich, I paid my balance on time, and I kept using their savings and checking account as well. Then came the downturn of the economy. I decided that going to a credit union would be better for me. I kept my credit card with the bank though. When I got married, I decided to change my name. The credit department decided to run a check on me and decided that I was no longer good enough to be their customer. They subsequently closed my account. I guess that they don't see me as a customer, just a number. Despite my diligence, my account was ultimately terminated.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,6,18,23,1,0
23,Rachel,2012-06-18,2,"Bank of America is not a bank I would recommend. I have been a customer for over 10 years and overtime things have changed for the worst. Their number one focus is making money, which for a bank is expected, but they do it at the expense of their customers. I recently had to change my bank account to an online bank account in order to avoid the various fees they were charging. If I choose to enter the bank I will be charged a monthly fee of 8+ dollars. In order to avoid that fee I have to do my banking online and via ATM. Recently I attempted to deposit a check at a bank ATM- the ATM screen displayed a message saying that it could not accept checks at that time. To sum it up being a BoA customer is extremely frustrating. The only reason I have stuck with them is due to the fact that they are everywhere. I moved away from home and a lot of the banks they have in this state aren’t available in my home state and vice versa.

They allowed me to pick only the services I wanted without having to add any services I had no desire to use, and were very thorough to ensure I wouldn't cause myself additional fees. I got a very cool Red Sox themed debit card about two weeks after signing up.I don't know why more banks don't try to utilize their ATMs, I like seeing the receipt have the checks right on it in case I need proof of them when something goes wrong, which to this point nothing has.

25,Aero OnFire,2012-06-18,1,"I was once a customer of Bank of America. Everything was fine with them while I had my job. I was only 15 years old and had a savings and a checking and my own debit card. Things were great.However one day I charged my debit card without funds in the bank 4 times in one day. I had cash but I miscalculated my funds in the bank and thought I had enough money. [in total the purchases combined cost was about 3 dollars.]The following day I go to my bank, turns out they slammed me with $212 overdraft fees. This is completely ridiculous and I will never ever again use this horrible excuse of a bank. I had enough money in my savings to cover the fees, so I balanced out the $212 dollar charge, and left that bank for good.This event scarred me and I have not had a bank since. I'm 22 years old now and deal in cash only. I cash my checks at Walmart where they charge 3 dollars. I'd much rather lose 3 dollars to cash a check than $212 dollars to greedy scumbags with no remorse for someones small mistake.I hate this company and wish nothing but the worst for all future endeavors of these soulless, remorseless monsters.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,6,18,26,1,0

The fees that they charge are rather high. When you call customer service, it is mostly automated so it is really hard to get a real person on the phone. When you do get someone on the phone, they person is most likely Indian, so it is hard to understand them and sometimes it takes a long time to get the service you want. For a big bank, I don't recommend using their services and I would not go back to them for any services I need.

I mean, regardless of what city I found myself in (I travel a lot) there was always a BofA somewhere nearby.However, after numerous incidents where my account balance would inexplicably drop, I had had enough. The process to get an account closed is just horrendous. There is no easy way to do it. I've read online that your account is never actually closed.

Once you get past the required Excellent credit rating, you're looking at a card with excellent reward potential. For starters, simply spending $500 within 90 days of opening the account will earn you $100 off your next travel purchase. Following that, you'll earn 1.5 points per dollar spent, which as they seem proud to say, truly is 50% more than most other rewards programs I've seen (1 point=1 dollar) Also, if you combine this card with a valid Bank of America account, you'll earn a 10% bonus to the points you've accumulated.

When I later called to see if I can redeem the miles, I found out that my miles would become available after the first purchase. Well ok, that's reasonable. So, when my card came in I made a purchase on it and called them back again to redeem my miles. THEIR STORY CHANGED A SECOND TIME! Now all of a sudden I find out that my miles wouldn't be available until after my first billing cycle. Wtf, I have to go home. I thought whatever, I'm going to be flying again soon anyway, I can use my miles at that point. Well now it's been a month and a half later, I'm trying to use my miles (which should be 15,150 by now) and it shows that I have 0 miles in my account!

I do not like that about this card.Despite the rewards points and no annual fee, I think a better credit card is the Chase Freedom Visa because it has no annual fee, and 15 months no interest on both balance transfers and purchases. You also earn up to 5% cash back on purchases, and get a $100 bonus if you spend $500 within the first three months.

Not the right card for you if you want lucrative rewards and are willing to pay an annual fee, but if you can’t afford an annual fee, want a great sign up bonus, and want very satisfactory ongoing rewards while improving your credit history, you can’t go wrong with this card.

In the 11 years I had the card I never missed a payment - missed a payment in January, spoke to people at Bank of America who told me it was not a problem, and then they closed my account in February without notifying me. When I paid the card off in full soon after, it just disappeared from my account and when I called they finally told me it had been closed and there was nothing they could do. They are not a bank for the people by any means. I've been in good standing with them for 11 years both in my checking account & credit card but have definitely had to dispute some random fees throughout the years, and more.

They basically disregarded the initial information that I gave them and sided with the vendor I filed against. Then to add insult to injury, I presented additional, detailed information, which proved the facts of my dispute, and Bank of America still supported the vendor. So I do not know what type of individuals they employ to handle disputes, but I feel that they do not truly value their customers. I experienced poor service/ frustration from the vendor, just to again be disappointed and frustrated by my bank. Thus, if I experience another unsupported claim with Bank of America, I will quickly terminate all services with them, and bank with an institution that fights for its customers.",,wallethub.com,male,6,3,105,1,2

I get a notification on my app I'm at a -888,888.00 balance. When I call the bank I'm told the bank did it for security risk so no one including me can touch the account. Turns out its frozen and due to be closed due to possible check fraud. Come to find out a favor I did for a so called friend turned out to be a bad check. It was never cashed it was returned and I got a 12.00 fee for returned check. I have been told so many lies by over 10 different employees i have spoken to since may 11th till today may 27th. My Bill's that are debited out of my account are gonna go through, that was a lie. Call in 3 days and will have an answer, that's was a lie. Request was put in to get my money sent to me that I have in my account, that was a lie. They say they make a note on my account everytime I call, that was a lie. It keeps going on and on. My Bill's are hounding me and late fees are adding up. When I ask I'm sure late fees will not be paid by bank of America cause they the ones that froze my account and that's the only truth I get is that they are not responsible for my late fees. I was also told it could take 3 months to resolve the issue. When I asked can anyone call the investigator on my case and they response was there isn't a number it's a group of analyst reviewing my account. So if there is an emergency for example a fire they dont have a phone to call 911 there are just gonna sit there. Bank of America is full of it. When I asked so being a customer since 1993 doesn't mean anything no credit or nothing, all I get is dead silence and then the same crap again that my account is being investigated.

They told me I was wonderful, and a candidate for a reduction, and, to their credit, they did drop some. But they didn't come near my other APRs.They said they couldn't because I was paying down my balance and not charging anything. I told them I was charging, but on cards with lower rates. They said if I began charging on their card--at the higher rate—“maybe” something could be done at some unspecified future date.What kind of financial advice is “Use the card with the highest APR?” Bankers don't know marketing. You want more people charging? Put out a competitive rate and people will use it. It doesn't work the other way 'round, BA! So I'm in the market for a balance transfer deal.

Before then, I was a credit union customer, so this is also my first experience with a “big name” bank.What I dislike about Bank of America is that it seems as if they are kind of “stingy” in terms of account options. Basically, the only services of Bank of America's that I can use are the ATMs and the online and telephone customer service. If I were to request checks, or to (god forbid) want to walk into the bank and speak to a human being, I would have to pay for that service. I was extremely put off by that, but at least they offer a “free” option, as I was not going to pay to be part of a bank.Besides that, I haven't had any real problems. I did have an issue with an overdraft fee and a customer service representative; the first person that I talked to told me that she couldn't help me. However, I called back and another representative graciously helped me. I guess it all depends on who you talk to. Luckily, the problem was resolved.I REALLY like the Bank of America app that allows you to deposit checks from your phone. Now, that's pretty cool.

In comparison, the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card requires that one spend $1,000 during the first three months for the same benefit. It's clear that the BankAmericard is a better option during the initial period and the benefits do not stop there. The card offers 1.5 points for every dollar spent after the Intro period although this is less than the 2 points offered by the Capital One venture card.

However, when it came to their checking account my experience was quite positive. I generally only do stuff online so I am not that familiar with the in branch experience other than the one thing I'll mention below. For online though, I don't think B of A can be beat. Their website has always been very fast and easy for me to use.The one problem I had was while I was there, the monthly fee changed as did the minimum requirements. At the time I wasn't really using this account much and I had just graduated and didn't have a lot of money. I got a monthly charge for not having enough funds in my account to meet the minimum. Needless to say that this was not something I was happy about. So I went in to my local branch expecting to have to argue and complain and probably close my account and go through the hassle of moving somewhere else. Instead though, I was nicely treated and when I explained my problem, the lady I spoke to said that they understand and that she would refund the charge to my account and waive the minimum requirements for the next 6 months.I think most places provide good service or appear to when everything is going fine, but the way they treat you when something goes wrong is the real test and in that regard Bank of America really impressed me.

The most convenient thing about having a checking account with Bank of America is the plentiful amount of locations and ATM's. One thing I wish they would improve is the quality of their customer service. There have been way too many times that I would have to wait a long amount of time to reach one of their representatives.Another thing I have an issue with are the maintenance. I originally signed up with a student account that had no fees. However, now that I have a regular checking account, the fees are way too much ($12), especially compared with other banks. Although I love the convenience of being able to find an ATM machine almost wherever I am, the fees make me want to switch banks.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,11,2,138,1,5

173,steadyfish24_wallethub,2020-09-15,1,"I found the mortgage team I worked with very unprofessional and am extremely dissatisfied. There were multiple issues throughout the process and every time I just had to accept what loan officers (and their managers) prescribed or else I would need to go get the mortgage elsewhere. Specific issues:1. Rate lock without consent: The loan officer locked the rate without my consent. When I reached out to the his manager to intervene she offered a solution - I go to some other bank (she'll reimburse me for the appraisal costs incurred so far) or I stay with BofA and the rate stays locked. Being just 2 weeks from my closing date, I had no other alternative but to go with the rate that the loan officer locked without my consent.2. Lack of communication: About 10 days prior to my scheduled closing date, I asked for closing early by 3 days. Loan officer responded saying - I see no issues why we can't. After that I sent multiple emails to the loan officer, loan coordinator and their managers for an update but the next meaningful update I received from them was at 7 PM on the day before closing - At that point they needed more documents from me. Eventually, they closed my loan on Aug 31st after I waited at the title company's office for an hour.3. Bait and switch: The loan officer promised a lower lender origination fees ($785) but told me on the day of my closing that it would be $1135. The explanation: the original quote was for a single family home and he realized on the day of closing that I'm purchasing a condo and hence higher fees. The resolution: On the day of closing when I'm waiting at the title company's office to sign papers, the loan officer calls me, tells me that the fees will be higher and he'll clear the loan only if I accept the higher origination fees otherwise he won't.I have been a BofA customer for 9 years and I am soon going to move to some other bank for the bulk of my banking needs.",Bank of America Mortgages,wallethub.com,,9,15,174,1,1

I never really thought about why they did it until I found out the hard way one day. One Thursday night before payday, I inadvertently used my debit card one too many times and I did overdraw thinking it would be in pending for days. NO, BOA decided to clear that transaction in lightening speed and proceeded to process the rest of the transactions as well in an order that created the most overdraw fees possible for them. If they would have processed all transactions in order then I would have only one overdraft fee, but in the order they processed the transactions it caused an onslaught of overdraft fees.

I think they eventually rejected that idea once the bad press came out, but just knowing they were considering it was enough for me to leave them and head to a credit union.

I wasn't on as a joint account holder at the time because he left suddenly so they had to have him call in to have them reverse the fee. Meanwhile he can't call for a couple months so these fees keeping adding up every day and when he returned and explained he was military and unable to call in and could even provide proof they said too bad. He was forced to either pay all those fees for a small computer error or close his account. Needless to say, we will never bank with them again or recommend anyone to bank with them. The error was a transaction for 16$ that was taken out twice, then one was put back all within a fraction of a second but it was enough to put us in the negative and accrue fees.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,5,8,187,1,4

203,Ron Davis,2020-12-02,1,"My experience has been atrocious.When we first started our mortgage, we turned around all document requests in 24 hours or less. I said I was worried about missing our purchase contract date and losing our home, since it was in a very hot neighborhood in Seattle and we had gotten a great deal. I was continuously reassured that we would not miss the date. They missed it. We got an extension and they missed it again. Fortunately, our sellers were out of town and we lucked out; they didn’t want to open back up for more offers (the house had been discovered by then). We could have lost the house.Now, four years later, I'm trying to refinance (with another lender, thank goodness). I’ve had eight hours over the course of a month or more on the phone with this place. I had a Covid deferral that needed to be paid off. I couldn’t pay it directly, so I had to get it “moved to the front.” I paid the $9k. The funds were “unapplied.” I had to call in again, they “released” them, sent a new payoff letter. Poof! There was a new $3800 payment for Covid I needed to make, and it showed that my regular payment was late (It wasn’t; I paid it on time). Both my regular payment and my escrow payment went to “unapplied funds.” So I called in again, went through the phone tree and got them both “applied.” Except I didn’t. The $3800 still wasn’t applied. So I called in again. After my fourth or fifth experience escalating to the centralized escalation team (or a manager, depending), I had to ask them to do it again. A manager named Erin this time said she would do it and call me in the morning to confirm whether it had happened. I said, “I need your number so I can be sure I won’t get left hanging.” “Sorry, we don’t have one; we are inbound only. I will definitely call you.” Surprise! She didn’t. Surprise! The $3800 still isn’t applied. Also, my current escalation manager says the previous folks left no documentation. I’m now being told I should talk to a new department. Maybe they will be able to help…I cannot wait until this is over.

Then I decided to use the chat feature for the first time and talk to a customer service rep to help pay my bill. Thankfully my bill wasn't due until at least 10 days after that day, but I like to pay my bills early. So, the chat rep took my info and said she scheduled a payment for me (did not say when). I check my account a week later and it wasn't paid!! I tried the chat feature again to ask why, and another person told me that a payment was scheduled for THE DAY THE PAYMENT IS DUE. How irresponsible! Here I am trying to be a responsible client by paying my bill way ahead of time, and BofA screws me over. So I try to actually call them to tell them I want the payment to be scheduled TODAY. Of course I'm greeted by a VERY lengthy voice machine that gives me absolutely no useful options to resolve this issue. I kept pressing 0, and was on hold for at least 15 minutes, until finally I got a hold of someone. By then I was angry because of having to maneuver the stupid voice machine and wait for so long, but I repressed my feelings and remained friendly to the customer service rep. To add insult to injury, the representative on the phone had a VERY low voice and was hard to hear. Every time she said something I had to say “What? I can't hear you.” and she would just get frustrated with ME. I had my phone volume on the highest possible level and that didn't help at all. She told me she would amend the transaction date.

Their online banking tool is one of the best that I have ever used. All my accounts are linked together (checking/savings/credit card) and I am able to pay my bills with absolutely no trouble from their site. Another neat feature of their online banking tool, it that you can eliminate all paper bills as they will notify you when certain bills are due (they are able to “link” with your cell phone company, cable provider, credit card company and have billing notifications go through them). Their customer service is also very good. I have always been greeted every time I have walked through any of their branch doors. Their tellers are professional, quick and knowledgeable.

Also, the lady I tried resolving this issue with at my branch is horrible. Again, unclear disclosures, unhelpful....to the point I reported her because she would actually play some games.

I usually use shoebuy.com to purchase shoes and by logging in through the Bank of America website, I was able to receive a whopping 10% cash back. They have lots of common merchants on this page and occasionally some coupon codes to go with them (I once saved 20 dollars on express.com with no restrictions). They also have a BankAmeriDeals page where they will list several merchants and they will pay up to 15% cash back in the case you use your card at that location. Also, they give 1% cash back on everything, 2% for groceries and 3% for gas. I highly recommend this card.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,2,21,229,1,3
229,Delma Mccaughan,2013-02-18,5,"This is a fantastic credit card. I decided to get it because I had a Bank of America checking account. The first reward I got was $100 after spending $500. I now get 1% for every purchase but an additional percent for groceries and two additional percentage points back for gas. I drive a lot for my job so that's great. By redeeming my rewards directly to my bank account, I get an extra customer bonus back of 10%. I had a few concerns once about my identity being compromised, but they took care of it and assured me everything would be okay.

230,Jack Lusk,2012-06-18,2,"I chose the simple e-banking option without a monthly fee. I'm a student and this makes the most sense, since I don't have a huge income. My account has certain limitations, that makes it a pain to bank with Bank of America. I can not use a teller and I must use the ATM or online banking to do all of my banking. The person signing me up even said that Bank of America has a fee for everything (that should have been a red flag). After about six months I start getting a five dollar fee every month. I called them and was of course put on hold for about thirty minutes before I talk to somebody about it. Apparently the notice that they were changing their terms and services was mailed to the wrong address. In the end they did waive the fee and resolve the problem after a couple teeth being pulled. They have some dishonest business practices that make me never want to bank with them again. Maybe they should realize I am the one giving them the capital for next to nothing interest and they should respect me as a customer more.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,6,18,231,1,0

I have a checking account with Bank of America and haven't encountered any issues in regard to financial transactions. Every time I walk into one of their locations, I feel like there's too much emphasis placed on recruiting new members instead of servicing existing members. The lines are long and the locations I've visited seem under staffed. I definitely wouldn't feel comfortable taking out a loan from Bank of America because I don't think this bank offers the best deals for its customers.

After looking at all my options, I ended up at Bank of America. I was stunned when I found out I could open up an account without any monthly fees at all. As the months went by, I had absolutely no problems with Bank of America. Then when I had my debit card information stolen, I learned how kind and compassionate the people who work customer service are. I was worried it would be someone who didn't understand English, but it turned out to be someone local and we even made small talk.I would not give up Bank of America for any other bank.

233,Barb,2012-06-18,5,"My husband and I have held this Visa card, originally issued by MBNA, for the last 20+ years. Bank of America was one of small handful of creditors who were very willing to work with us when we experienced great financial difficulty. We did not want to lose the card or the very large credit limit we had established on it, but due to unforeseen circumstances, we came to a point in our lives where we were simply not able to keep up with everything, including our monthly payments on the card.When we dove into doing everything we could to pay our debts, repair our credit and avoid bankruptcy at all costs, I called Bank of America and was transferred to a debt specialist who worked with me on the phone for over an hour coming up with a doable plan to reduce our payment and stop further interest from accruing. As long as we kept up with our end of things, there would be no further penalty and once our debt was paid off, Bank of America would issue us new cards. While they never technically closed our account so it wouldn't appear as a card-issuer closure on our credit report, they did ask that we send them our current cards and would not authorize any purchases to be make on the account.Our debt specialist was wonderful and checked in on us every quarter for the next few years as we diligently made our payments. I felt as if the specialist were truly concerned and once we finished making our payments, we received our agreement, marked paid in full, from Bank of America. They also worked very quickly to issue new cards and restored our credit line in full.I was surprised to receive such service from such a large company and never once was made to feel like a terrible human being for having financial difficulties.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,6,18,234,1,0
234,James Jacks,2012-06-18,4,"I have been a customer of Bank of America for almost a decade. I started with a student account. I actually opened my account with Fleet just prior to Bank of America's acquisition, and my account was seamlessly transitioned into BoA later that year. The student checking was wonderful, and I never had any problems with it. The fees were light (I actually can't remember any fees at all!) and the debit card was very convenient.However, all good things must come to an end. I have since transitioned into a grown-up account (they call it something more professional, of course) and that comes with a few new fees. The one that really bugs me is the ""account maintenance fee"" of $12 per month which they only charge if your balance falls below $1500. Times are tight, so it sucks that I have to keep that much extra in my checking account just to avoid their massive fee which would otherwise add up to $144 per year!But other than that fee, the bank has been great. They customer service phones are EXCELLENT. My wife is with Wachovia (er... I guess they are ""Wells Fargo"" now, since the buyout) and I cannot believe how badly that company treats her.

What has happened lately though is, as I have moved on in my life and have noticed that while my personal banking remains relatively straight-forward and fee free, my business accounts are riddled with fees and charges from everything from making change to making large cash deposits. As a result I am considering changing banks to a local credit union for both my personal and business accounts..

I've been lucky to have only one over draft, which was reversed when I provided online documentation of when my purchase was made, and when the over draft occurred. That's what I most appreciate about BoA - the tellers are always open to your side, never brusque and will bring a supervisor to you to resolve the problem, instead of leaving you standing at the window wondering what they're talking about in the back room!",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,6,18,237,1,0

I love that my account (MyAccess Checking) is free with direct deposit so I donât have to worry about any monthly fees and that every time I have had any kind of problems or questions the people that work there seem to be eager to fix or answer them for me without making me feel dumb about it.

They were able to handle all of my credit card transactions, and I never felt as if I were getting screwed by the bank. That's a rarity these days in banking.

The staff is friendly and competent. One negative, however, about their checking account is their monthly fee is kind of high so that is a little disappointing. Another is you have to keep a minimum balance otherwise they will close your account. A couple minor problems, I've had with them in the past is the speed in which they process online and ACH payments which is kind of slow compared to some banks. For Bank of America, it was taking 5-7 business days, but other banks it has been only 1-3 days at the most. I've also had some pretty nasty overdraft fees that were charged before some of my deposits were processed.

This option makes the AAA Member Rewards Card a decent option for consolidating other credit debt onto one card.The card also features a meager rewards program which earns one to three points per dollar spent.

The $100 bonus is nice and may make this card more rewarding for the first year only.

247,eric,2013-11-29,5,"This checking account is pretty ideal for my needs. I usually try to avoid banking fees at all costs, because it is an unnecessary expense for me, and impedes my ability to save. I only had $150 to open the account, meaning didn't have the $300 to avoid the fee. Luckily they provide another way to avoid it: a $25 monthly transfer from my checking account. I have direct deposit from my job, so this is all very automatic and convenient. At this rate, I can turn off the monthly transfers in a few months if I choose, but I think I will keep them going. The yearly interest rate isn't really a draw for me, as I don't think I'll ever have enough in the account for it to make much of a difference. Overall though, the account is super convenient, and I can make manual transfers between accounts online, and luckily, Bank of America ATMs are ubiquitous, adding to the convenience. I've had the account for about 3 years, and I've never had to contact their customer service, so I can't say much about that.

A friend of mine uses his for everything, then spends the points on holiday gifts towards the end of each year. Personally I like the Amex One card, where you just get 1 percent of everything put in a special savings account you can withdraw in cash. It can be a little difficult to figure out the cash value of points you get, but I don't think it's as much as the one percent. Their rates are pretty good depending on your credit.

It’s just bizarre that they couldn’t trust me with an extra $500 on my BankAmericard, but they’re perfectly fine with my having an extra $12,500 at my disposal.

I went with them anyway because I felt that if you are mindful with your spending and keep your checkbooks balanced most overdrafts can be avoided. I also liked that they gave me a temporary card so my money wouldn't be tied up while I waited for the permanent card. Ebay took some money out of my account without me knowing and that made me over draft by I think $4 or $5. I put money in the account the day after unaware of what happened.

There was an issue with my mortgage that involved me having to drive four hours away, on the first of every month, to make my payment in person. They took six months to figure that nonsense out before they finally let me make my payments online again. There is no physical location closer to me than that and that made them a trouble to me as well. The employees do not care about the customers or about how they are treated.

One thing I haven't been pleased with is all of the fees that they have. I have had my fair share of them and I can tell you first-hand that they are not fun and I have not once been able to get one removed from my account. It's hardly fair. On the other hand, they have great customer service, aside from when you're trying to deal with fees. For issues that don't involve them giving you money back they go above and beyond what most people expect from their banks.

Even paying my bill a certain way, it seemed like they would get you with a fee. Although, Bank of America wasn’t my favorite bank, there are banks that are a lot worse than them!

268,Mark,2013-01-25,4,"I have been banking with Bank of America since 2007 and have had almost entirely positive experiences with them. Previously I was with Washington Mutual, but decided to merge accounts. The few times I have had issues with Bank of America, they were quickly resolved over the phone through the customer service hotline. I frequently travel and am outside the United States. My biggest problem with the bank is the operating hours of the call centers. For people like me, it can be very difficult to get in contact with them considering the time zones. For most people this is not going to be an issue, however, as most of their customers are usually calling from within the United States. All in all, I am quite pleased to be a Bank of America customer when it comes to my checking account.

269,M,2013-01-22,2,"I was with Bank of America for about a year. If ripping people of and nickel and diming your customers over petty, unnecessary charges is the American way, then this Bank definitely earns its namesake. As with most banks, the application process to setup a checking and savings account was very easy. Customer service was subpar in my opinion. I'm used to waiting in phone queues, but the wait times for B of A seemed to be more treacherous than any other experiences I have had with customer services departments at different banks. When I finally did get through, B of A was horrible at resolving any issues in a timely and effective manner. I often found myself wanting to throw my phone at the ground while talking to their customer service reps. On to my next and most important point… they screw you over with fees that many other banks simply don't have. There is a $14 monthly fee for checking accounts if the average daily balance is not at least $1,500. In this tough economy, where people are struggling, who really needs that? No thanks, I'd rather stick with HSBC and avoid fees on my account and get the same exact services offered. What's that? You want to use online banking with B of A? OK, be ready to pay an $8.95 monthly service charge unless you agree to receiving only online statements AND never needing to use a teller in person for withdrawals. That's right. If you use a teller to manually withdraw any money, you will need to pay the $8.95 fee! Hopefully by now, you see where this is going.... B of A rips you off, plain and simple. Why put your hard earned money in a bank which looks to squeeze every last drop out of you when you can easily pick another bank which offers the same, if not better, services without theses additional fees? Do yourself a favor and research other options before opening an account with these fools.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,1,22,270,1,1

Even for travelers, I feel the rewards are somewhat minuscule. APR can be high, and overall I feel that there are far more cards out there that are better than this one.

There are no limits to the amount of points you can earn either, which makes this much better than other cards that have a focus on travel.

The downside is that you are limited towards a statement credit towards travel, not for cash back, gift cards, or other rewards that other programs offer.

As soon as I found out I missed a payment, I immediately called and explained missing their emails and informed them that my credit union would send the money immediately electronically. It would have been good customer relations to waive the fee, but they refused to do so. The main problem with BoA was after I pad and they received the money, I received a letter from BoA stating that my credit limit (built up over years) had been reduced to $500 from $57,500. If I wanted a store charge card, I would have gotten one and it would have been much more that $500. I called to ask how the decision was made, Tonya was no help and I asked for a manager. After waiting on hold for about 20 minutes, I hung up and will not ever speak to anyone there again. Absolutely the worst customer service imaginable, how anyone uses BoA is beyond me.

For that reason it is important to read over the rules and conditions when getting this account. They also have a ""keep the change"" feature which rounds your spending up to the nearest dollar when you purchase something and automatically puts the change in your savings account. This feature is cool because you are saving money and sometimes are not too alert to you. Overall though I dislike some of the fees associated with this account and am starting to hate corporate banks. I would suggest something like a credit union instead.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,3,18,310,1,1

The interest rate is started low for the introduction period, and then has gone up to industry average. There is no fee for the card, which I like. The rewards program is decent. I've used it a couple of times to get cash back. I enjoy the online banking. It is very easy to use and clear. I have another card that offers better interest rates and point systems, but this card is quite good as well. I would recommend it to anyone, especially as a starter card. to build credit.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,8,23,311,1,4

So I got this card for starters and it's been working out so far. Although there's no rewards, this card is perfect for bringing you into the folds of credit card payments. There's nothing special about the no rewards, which is somewhat off putting, the balance transfers and cash advances are on par with a lot of other basic student cards. But the great thing about this card is that you will get alerts on fixed payments in order to keep track of your financial situation.

It's rewards program is pretty decent I guess, it's not that special though and probably will get replaced if you find yourself with a more popular rewards credit card. Although the points are nice on the card, there is no limit to how many you can earn every year, and you get a bonus to the amount you earn for the first 6 months, which is nice. Other than that I find that this card is just kind of lack luster and isn't worth using over some of other cards I have.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,8,23,313,1,4
313,Alexandria Ellington,2013-08-22,5,"The terms of the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Card are completely reasonable and do provide many benefits to anyone looking to earn incentives when they use their credit card. The intro rate of 0 percent is very promising and ideal as is the fact that there is no max overlimit fee. Dealing with a limit fee can be a hassle and its great that the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Card has dropped this altogether. The chance of getting $100 cash back bonus after you make $500 in purchases within 90 days of account opening should be easy for anyone to achieve so just by signing up and using it a bit, you will already reap rewards. Used smartly, it is like they are paying you to use their service.

It is completely manageable and has a low rate for a person first starting out to build their credit. My payments every month have been extremely low, around 15 or 16 dollars a month which has allowed to a lot of room for re payment as well as other living expenses. I also liked their flexible payment date which allowed me to schedule their payments according to what is best for me.

I usually use it for online purchases and some restaurant charges, and the interest rate is very reasonable, and my monthly bill is relatively low, at less than $20. I have the option for a credit line increase, but I've never really needed it. It does come with some rewards for things like Netflix, but I haven't used those either.

Your credit is limited for a reason, but can be extended if you demonstrate good credit habits. The $39 annual fee seems a bit steep, but I suppose that's just BankAmericard taking advantage of what they can. I think the BankAmericard is a good step in the right direction for those that really need it. It seems to create necessary restrictions and precautions while helping people establish better credit little by little. Obviously this isn't something someone with an average or above average score would need, but it's nice to know something like this is there for some that need it.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,8,16,318,1,4

There's no annual fee for the first year, but there's different amounts of payments for tier levels. The Rewards are miles based, with an initial bonus of 15,000 miles and a 2 miles/$1 for base/max earn. You can redeem round trip rewards after 5,000 miles and no blackout dates for flight redemption. The Purchase, Balance Transfers, and Cash Advances are on par with other cards such as the SouthWest Airlines. The Paperless Statement Option and online alerts are something of a plus, but it's a guarantee option nowadays with most other cards. Comparing this to the Southwest Airlines Card, it is seriously lacking to Southwest's 50,000 bonus points options, but Southwest is points based instead of mileage based.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,8,16,319,1,4

Earning extra points with gas is extremely helpful and you still earn points everywhere you shop. The interest rates are pretty standard and I do not have to pay any fee for the card. It is never worth it to have to pay for the privilege to use the card. I have used this card for a multiple things like trips and vacation and its nice to take a look at the rewards after you have made some larger purchases.

My husband and I were recently married, and we wanted a joint bank account to deposit our wedding gifts.

321,William B,2013-02-27,4,"I have been banking with Bank of America for around six years. In my experience, their customer service team is outstanding. I have gotten many overdrafts overturned because their customer service agents were nice enough to listen to what happened and make a judgment call. While I've paid many fees in the past to Bank of America, I feel like their customer service over the years makes it worth it. Any time I needed something simple in the past, such as a replacement debit card, they were extremely fast and courteous to me on the phone.Aside from their spectacular customer service skills, their online site is a lifesaver. Keeping track of a budget for me is extremely hard at times, but having all of the information online makes budgeting out my month much easier. I never receive a paper statement anymore, which is great.The reason I gave them three stars in “clear disclosures” is because their policies can be hard to understand sometimes, especially when it comes to fees. It's somewhat hard to get a representative to tell you these policies in an easy to understand way, so you're left with lots of fine print to go over if you want to avoid fees.Overall, Bank of America has provided me with more happiness than headaches over the years. People may say negative things about them, but they are a functional bank with many wonderful employees who are extremely nice and helpful.

Those bankers that you speak with are a mixed bag of customer service and can be very slow to help.They also seem to be understaffed at busy times, in my experience, with only one or two tellers.

It was easy to set up a direct deposit and I can pay off my mortgage early. They include a few tools to see how much faster you can pay it off with different methods like biweekly payments or additional payments. You can also pay a little more on principle or escrow online. They also have a calendar that shows when you are due and where late charges come into play.The thing I use the most though is the iPhone app where you can pay your mortgage on the phone so I don't even have to log into the computer. All in all, it's not bad. They are a few things I wish they had though like an auto pay feature but I am not sure I have heard of any banks offering that.Also, if you have an escrow and it goes over the amount authorized there is no option to just put that money on the principle. They end up sending you a check at the end of the year and you have to go cash it then bring it back to them.

The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is that their loans are not really competitive.

For my savings needs I go to other online banks. As for the checking, there is a high minimum in order not to incur charges. Otherwise, you should have a direct deposit set up (1500 minimum). Not bad but a bit high for someone. I have a direct deposit and try to keep as little money in the account as needed. I am a heavy user of credit cards for cashback and such so I just budget how much I will need and keep it in the checking account to pay off the cards. The customer service is meh. I only had to deal with them once to make sure my credit card could be used overseas. They didn't seem to get the concept or what I was requesting.

They recently added the ability to transfer money via mobile numbers, which is a great perk. In the last few years, I have had my identity stolen a few times, mostly due to shopping online on not protected sites. In most cases, Bank of America found out it happened before I did and alerted me to this. When it happened a few years ago right around Christmas, I was completely stressed out because they had wiped out all the money in my checking account.

I have also had a Visa BankAmericard Cash Rewards credit card with them for 1 year.The positive: I love that there are always a good number of ATMs around where I can do withdrawals and deposits (even check deposits!). I love that they have a nice, secure online banking system that's relatively easy to navigate and make transfers and pay off my credit card. I love that I get pretty decent cash-back on my credit card purchases and there's no annual fee for the card.The negative: Calling for simple issues can sometimes be a pain, it takes a while to get through to a person (I don't need to hear that I can check my account online 8x before trying to resolve my issue). But it is nice that it's 24/7 and I have to say that although the phones are flawed, online chat support is very nice and convenient (but I'm not always by a computer).I'm also not a fan of the fees they try to stick you with sometimes, e.g. too many transfers in a month one time cost me $5, and I wasn't warned or made aware of this fee before it was taken.My interest on my savings could be a bit higher, it's pretty abysmally low.Overall: Love the convenience, but there's some bad things when you go with such a large bank, they don't seem to care too much about you.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,7,18,335,1,2

I can't remember ever having an easier time opening a bank account. Until recently I never had a derogatory comment for Bank of America. I was given the option to get overdraft coverage for my account. I got it with a click of a button. Needless to say there were a couple of times that I had to use it and it was great that I only got a charge of $10.00 instead of the normal $32.00 when I had an oops in my bank account. For some reason it recently just disappeared and in order to get it again there are many more steps to the process and I no longer qualify! I still have not figured out what happened! The only other problem is there are not enough locations. My husbands employer does not offer direct deposit and the closest Bank of America to his workplace is over sixty miles! By the time he gets home the bank is already closed. Sometimes he gets paid in the middle of the week and we have to wait till the weekend to make the deposit. I have direct deposit through my employer and it has always been smooth sailing with Bank of America.

It is, in fact, very easy to use, checking balances on the mobile app is a great feature, transferring to and from savings and credit cards is a snap and the bill pay works great for the most part. However, they tend to find any way possible to charge you fees, using a non-BoA ATM will net you not only the ATM fee but an additional BoA fee, overdraft protection from savings will get you a $10 charge every time, and the talk of charging a monthly checking fee is disconcerting.

Recently, however they’ve implemented a system of charging for the use of the checking accounts. Originally, they made an announcement that they would be charging and there was a mass exit of people from the Bank of America system. Because of this, they announced that they would not do the charges. About a month later, I received a charge on my account for banking fees.

I was so worried that she would accuse me of making a counterfeit bill, but she calmed my nerves.She just told me that she would need to take the bill and fill out paperwork. All I had to do was sign the paperwork and the banker would give me a copy just in case I needed to show it to my mother. She could give it to her boss in order to reimburse her for the counterfeit bill.I, personally, never had any problems with Bank of America.

This helps me to stay even though I have serious issues like never receiving disclosure letters about changes in their fees which has tripped me up a few times since I'm on a very tight budget.And even though I've been getting the same monthly deposit on the 3rd Wednesday of every month for almost 2 years, they charged $12 because the deposit came 1 day after what seemed like a shortened statement period and refused to refund it. The rep at the branch changed my account to an eAccount meaning I can't use the teller at all, in order to avoid a monthly fee. So, basically, they are using my money for almost nothing in return.I've also closed my savings account with them because I could not save enough money per month without it getting eaten up by the fees. Though I should say ATTEMPTED to close the savings account because I've called customer service 3x and gone into my local branch 2x yet still receive a printed monthly statement in the mail almost a year later (even though I chose the paperless option online when I still had the account)I am also having serious issues with their ethical behavior in terms of their role in the mortgage crisis, their political influence and interest rate manipulation. At this point, I've already researched my credit union and community bank options and one more bad experience or incidence of money grubbing will trump convenience and make me switch.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,1,11,346,1,4

Opening an account with them is quick and painless. I opened my account online and was able to complete it within a few minutes and had it approved the very next day. I received my card about five days later. Customer service is always really helpful and fair. They answer all of my questions really well and actually make an effort to listen to me and make things right. I lost my card once and they were quick to cancel the card and issue me a temporary card while I waited for my new card to come in the mail. Overall, I am really pleased with this bank and recommend them to anyone who is looking for a good trustworthy bank.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,1,11,347,1,4
347,Kristal,2013-01-11,5,"Several years ago, something happened that led me to know I would be a Bank of America customer for life. My parents had planned a trip to Hawaii to celebrate their 30th anniversary, and my dad's 50th birthday was also very close to this date. For over one year, I and my brothers had made arrangements to surprise my dad on his 50th by the whole family showing up in Hawaii to celebrate with him. This was a very big deal to us, a once in a lifetime event to spend this time together on a magical trip. We each saved and planned for over a year to make this happen. Four months before the trip, it was time to buy the airline tickets. My brothers gave me their money and I proceeded to buy the airline tickets for them and myself through my BoA checking account. A short time later, the unthinkable happened, the airline I purchased the tickets through went bankrupt. My tickets were no longer valid and the airline was not responding. Nearly $2500 was gone. I was in a panic. I called BoA and explained the situation and tried to dispute the charge for services not rendered. BoA took care of it. They reversed the charge from my account and it stood. Their guarantee was a life saver. That was and still is a lot of money. I will never forget that BoA took care of me in this way. If it were any other bank, I'm not so sure they'd have done the same. So, that is why I am a BoA customer for life.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,1,11,348,1,4
348,Sean,2013-01-11,4,I love the fact that Bank of America is so “prolific” and no matter what town or city I go into I am almost guaranteed to find one of their ATM machines. I don't like their $35 dollar overdraft fees. I love their website and the email reminders that they send me. I love their android app too. I especially love their new feature that allows you to literally just take a picture of your check and it's instantly deposited into your bank. Extremely neat and extremely convenient!

Bank of America tends to have a bad reputation with the general public but I have had no problems with them. There are no fees attached to my checking account, and I linked one of my Bank of America savings accounts to my checking account to prevent any overdraft charges. I have always received excellent customer service from the representatives. Before I linked the accounts, I accidentally overdrafted my checking account and the bank reimbursed me for all of the overdraft charges. The bank's website is user-friendly, and I use the bank's app on my smartphone quite frequently.

I feel as though I am part of the Bank of America family. Every associate I have ever engaged in conversation with has been very professional and very courteous.

I started with them when they were one of the only banks in my area and I have been with them through every major financial change in my life. With both my checking and savings account they are very helpful in securing my money and for that I'm forever thankful. A few months ago they alerted me before I could become the victim of identity theft when I used my debit card at a gas station. They called me up and asked if I just bought over 300.00 dollars worth of gas and of course I did not so they put a stop to that transaction and I had my new debit card in a few days. This was all while I was on vacation and I wouldn't have found out about it until I returned home.

Whenever I go into a branch the employees have always been friendly and helpful. I mostly use the online banking component and I have found this to be extremely easy and convenient to use. I especially enjoy the 'keep the change' feature to my checking account. This helps my savings grow by rounding up the amount I charge to my checking account to an even dollar amount and transfers that to my savings.

My bank has a terrible interest rate on personal loans so I did some shopping around and Bank of America was the best in my area. It was only a $5,000 loan so it was going to be paid off quickly and Bank of America was the only bank that would even consider loaning me such a small amount. The only issues I had were with the application and some issues I had when I made my first payment. The application was a bit confusing and I actually had to talk to the bank manager about a few things on the app that didn't make sense. I think of myself as rather competent so this irritated me a bit. The only other issue was when I made my first payment, it didn't post to the account until over a month after I made it. They charged me a late fee which they DID remove after I showed them proof of payment made and the date it was made on. Customer service was really attentive and always there to answer my questions.

I enjoy using this card for online purchases as they have a secure feature that allow a user to obtain a temporary card number and use it to make an online purchase. That way I have no fears of anyone obtaining my credit card number for illegal purposes. I have never had a problem with customer service. They are always very responsive.

However, I did not miss a payment, but wound up sending a payment in late just once and my card rate went up almost 10%. I felt like there was no grace period at all and immediately it hurt my credit and I felt from the start they would try to encourage me to have good credit with a card like this advertised to students.

I also feel very comfortable with the security precautions BoA takes in preventing credit card fraud: I often purchase items online from all over the world and don’t always have them shipped to my address, so BoA reaches out to me to ensure that it is me doing those transactions.

364,Fia H,2013-02-08,4,"I have been a B of A customer for about 9 years. B of A is the only bank I have ever been with, and where I hold three accounts, checking, savings, and a credit card. I have had nothing but a great experience with the customer service at B of A. For 9 years, I have never been charged an account fee. I originally signed up as a student and they offered free checking. Then to keep the free checking I just had to keep a minimum balance. One particular experience I was satisfied with was when I deposited $700 cash in an ATM at school. Somehow, the ATM on my college campus was jammed and the place where you put the money into the ATM closed up and the screen read “This ATM is temporarily out of service”. Before the screen went blank though, it read “We were unable to determine the cash amount deposited, please enter the amount”. I entered in the amount of $700, and in good faith that this would be the amount credited to my account. I immediately called B of A from the number on the ATM and let them know the machine just went down with my money still in the dispenser, they said that my account would be credited the amount I typed in. That night I went home, did some calculations and realized I had actually put $800 in the machine. I called B of A and let them know the discrepancy and they initiated a claim, but still allowed me the extra $100 in credit. They said I would get a letter a couple of days later, after the ATM machines were balanced, if there were any issues. I received a letter stating all was fine. I was just happy that they were able to credit my money, even without knowing the exact amount I put in. They relied on what I said, and I was able to have my money that day. Also, compared to other banks their overdraft policy is not bad at all because they do not charge you if it’s less than $10, or if you had money in your account the day of the transaction. The only thing I would suggest is NOT to use their online chat system. I got the runaround for about 20 minutes the time I tried. The rep (who I assume is contracted in a different country) didn't know what the heck I was trying to say. Going into the bank is the best way to get good customer service, or by calling.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,2,8,365,1,4
365,Adam,2013-02-08,4,"I have banked with Bank of America for about 9 years now. I would say my experience with them has been mostly positive. The benefits are lots of options for online banking and also that you can find a local branch almost anywhere in the U.S. However, there have been a few times when I considered switching banks. The first was the nationally publicized fiasco where they were strongly considering charging someone to use their debit card. Fortunately, they did not go through with it and thus I stayed a customer. I also had a personal problem where they deactivated my debit card due to questionable purchases, which were never made. I pulled $100 out of an ATM one time, which I rarely do, and they deactivated my card. I guess I should feel safe, but I'd rather them wait to deactivate it until there were multiple questionable transactions. Also, since it's a debit card, surely the fact that I had to enter my pin number for the transaction made it less questionable. The silver lining is that their problem resolution was very swift and easy. All in all, I'd recommend them.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,2,8,366,1,4

I chose Bank of America because I have four checking/savings accounts with them (and a mortgage) and I wanted to be able to link the card to my other accounts for convenience. In the first year of having it I ended up with a new kitchen aid blender, Henkel’s silverware for 16 just in time for Thanksgiving and a few nice gift cards to help with my Christmas shopping.

However, I did find it annoying that after I turned 24, my monthly balance had to be 1500 dollars in order to avoid being hit with recurring fees. The over draft charges were crazy as well. Now that I'm older the account is pretty much a dud. I barely use it because I don't want to be slammed with fees. The lack of interest on the account also makes it less than great when you look at other banks. Also, this is worth mentioning- their customer service is HORRIBLE.

While I am not a big fan of how Bank of America handles their checking, I do love my savings account. Since it is directly linked to my checking, I can easily transfer funds from my checking to my savings online. My favorite feature of my account, however, is the fact that whenever I make a debit card purchase, the change is transferred into my savings. So if I buy something with my card for 18.48, 52 cents is placed into my savings from my checking. It's a great little way to slowly add to your account. The only thing I would change is the interest rate.",Bank of America Savings & CDs,wallethub.com,female,11,11,389,1,1

At BoA, I was able to open an account online; it was a fast, easy, hassle-free process and best yet the account is FREE! A few months after opening the account, I wanted to upgrade my account. I called them up to do so and the process took about 5mins. The representative was super nice and courteous, as they also are in person at my local branch.

391,Sarah,2012-06-25,4,"My overall experience with Bank of America was horrible. I started a Student Savings account with them- they told me at the time of start up that it would be free. A month later I get a service fee of 9.99 for the account. When I went down to talk to them, they said the fee was because it was SUMMER! They told me the account was free so long as I was a student, and I was in high school at the time. They removed the fee only when I threatened to close the account and move to another bank, but they were hell to deal with every time I wanted to make a withdrawal from the account. When I got fed up and wanted to close the account, they tried to collect more fees and hold my money for 2 weeks, even though I hadn't violated any rules or contracts.

392,Cheryl Rushing,2012-06-25,5,"I started banking with another bank that was taken over by Bank of America years ago and have been with them ever since. Here is why: about 10 years ago I was living in Queens, NY and I lost my wallet at the laundromat one night. I didn't realize it until the next morning, and when I called to report my debit card lost, the agent I spoke with went over my account transactions with me. It turns out my wallet had been ""found"" and the debit card had been used several times overnight to clean out my account. I told them the last transaction I remembered and they said they would investigate. I think I had to fill out and fax something back to them for the investigation. As the transactions rolled in they would put the money right back into my account. They also sent me a replacement debit card. About two weeks later I got a letter in the mail saying the charges had been investigated, my money had been restored and they were closing their file. It was just that simple. There were no additional charges to my account, no bounced checks or fees, and no hassles from Bank of America. That is why I am still a loyal customer to this day.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,6,25,393,1,0

Unlike other, smaller banks that I've used, Bank of America has provided me with excellent customer service when I’ve left the country and has never given me any grief about extraneous charges. I’ve never had any security problems or even had to pay for my account with them, as it should be. I’ve never been turned down when trying to use my card after 2 years of having it and the features they provide, like overdraft protection and online banking, have never failed me.

When I first stepped foot into the bank, I was warmly greeted by friendly staff who promptly assisted me with applying for a new checking account. I currently have an online account with Bank of America and using it has been a breeze. It's so easy to use and they keep you updated via email regarding any changes that have been made to your account. I am very please with them and will likely keep my account with them for the rest of my life.

Their customer service is slow and impersonal; I have been unable to develop any personal relationships with anyone who works at my branch. There are far too many fees for every little thing. The employees at the windows are not well trained and are very slow, and the lines are very long and this includes in the customer service area when waiting for a specialist. There is no guard posted by the Versateller unit.

396,Tine,2012-06-25,3,"I've had more than a few Bank of America accounts. In fact my very first bank account was made with Bank of America thanks to an accumulation of a birthday money right around my fifth birthday. With a handful of checks I entered the bank with my mother as guardian and waited in line for a few minutes before being ushered to an uncomfortable chair where I squirmed partly in patience partly in excitement as I answered the questions of the administer. The process I remember took too long. The bank worker asked too many questions, mainly directed to my mother, and any supposed decision of my own was commandeered by her. That bank account I ended up having for about six years.It had no return on its investment. But the most positive thing about B of A was how easy it was to withdraw or deposit money, at that time. Unfortunately since then my local branch has not been quite so expedient, and even worse the interest rates on my accounts never amounted to diddly squat. And they send endless brochures of updated policies in fine print of how to squander their collateral and get it back by shifty policies. Join a credit union instead, or you are just giving more unearned holdings to the fat cats who gamble away your money rather than protect it.",Bank of America Savings & CDs,wallethub.com,female,6,25,397,1,0

I became one of their customers when I got married and was added to my husband's account on our honeymoon. It was pretty straightforward getting added to his account. However, after my name was changed it was not so easy getting my name changed on the account. We ended up having to go to the bank twice to get my name changed because they required additional information I did not have at the time.On other occasions we have had to make multiple trips to the bank to get things done because of different rules. Sometimes, the lines are fairly long but at other times there is no wait time. I have had to wait the most when I need to actually see someone other than a bank teller.

I have had no past experiences with banks and even my mother is a bit skeptical about banks. A family friend, who worked at a local Bank of America, strongly recommended his bank. To this day, I am glad I made the decision to join Bank of America.Both he and the company were able to inform me of all the opportunities and even taught me all the tips, tricks and benefits of having a bank account. My transition into the 'banking world' was smooth and enjoyable, thanks to the friendly employees at the bank. Currently, all my bills and transactions are managed by their online-banking system.

I live between Ohio and Massachusetts, and there are no Bank of America's in Ohio, but I am still able to transfer money and use that checking account when needed.

I’ve been impressed by Bank of America’s monitoring of my account. When I went to another state to buy something, my card was locked due to “unusual purchases” Although this may seem like an inconvenience, it showed me that Bank of America was serious about protecting my money. Also, a few months back my card number was stolen, and used half way across the country. Unfortunately Bank of America didn’t catch on this time, but when I noticed it and reported it, Bank of America refunded my money! That refund came right out of their bottom line, to me.

They never explained aspects of their banking system to me, causing me to incur fees that I never anticipated. Though the fees were paid back, I was only reimbursed after complaining on the telephone to several different BoA associates. Their online banking system also leaves much to be desired, as it is completely confusing and the format changes too frequently to keep up with and no warning at all is given for the coming changes.

At one time I had $120 worth of fees because of that and was simply told that was how their system worked.

This is only my second mortgage (this one and the original one on the house with GE) and I have been very pleased with BOA. Like many people, I have ended up upside down on my loan, but that isn’t BOA’s fault.

I’ve become increasingly frustrated with their glitch filled online banking system and their poor customer service. In part I think there is a correlation between the increase in my disappointment in Bank of America’s customer service and their recent acquisition of Merrill Lynch and several other financial institutions. My reasoning is mostly derived from the fact that a majority of the short comings are a result of a redundant bureaucracy. So many people are performing the same tasks that other important one’s get ignored. For example, a few weeks ago I lost a credit card that was issued by Bank of America. So, naturally I went into my local branch and waited 1.5 hrs for an accounts rep.

439,kevpp27,2020-04-28,1,"I have been a customer since 1992. The fees at BOA are higher than many other institutions, but we chose them as we assume they had all the systems and expertise we would even need. We submitted a Paycheck Protection Program loan application that sat in their queue for longer than the funding lasted, two and a half weeks. All of our information was correct but never made it to the SBA. Later they confirmed that yes our application was fine, but sorry the SBA isn't accepting applications. If they couldn't process my application, they should not have accepted it. That is what many small banks are doing. BOA damaged the prospects of my firm and didn't represent us at all when it matter most. Any bank can service us when things are great. When things go wrong, that is when having a Bank work with you is most important. My recommendation is to find a smaller local bank where you can talk to the principles as need arises. At Bank of America, you can barely get time with their front line people in times of need, and you have zero chance of speaking to someone more senior. We will be closing our accounts with Bank of America once we get passed this mess.

I signed up for their “Keep the Change” program so that all of my debit card purchases are rounded up to the nearest dollar and the change is deposited into my savings account. I can even see my stock information on the website. I love that it’s all in one place, on one site. A week after I signed up, a Bank of America rep even called to make sure everything was going well and to see if I have any questions. What great customer service!

475,Kate Gerhardt,2012-07-02,2,"I have had a checking and savings account with Bank of America for about 4 years. I currently have the eChecking account, so I do not go into the bank anymore and am waived the monthly fee. The day to day service of Bank of America is convenient and hassle free. However, when you have a problem, that's when you'll find dealing with them annoying. I had an identity theft problem and the person had emptied my account and put me in a -$900 balance. I called the bank immediately and they gave me all the information on what I needed to to, however, it took them over a month to do their part. They never processed my papers and I would get weekly phone calls about my account being in foreclosure and would keep having to explain that it was NOT my fault, and that my papers weren't being processed. In summary, I spent a month with a frozen bank account and no money, which as a college student, isn't easy. They eventually reimbursed me. However, a week later, the identity thief applied for a credit card in my name at a Bank of America. They were about to approve it, and gave me a phone call to confirm some employment information with me....when I told them that I didn't apply for the credit card and that was an identity theft problem, they refused to give me the address that was written on the application for the credit card IN MY NAME. They withheld information that would have exposed the identity thief to me. Overall, I have been dissatisfied by the services of Bank of America, but only stay with them for the convenience they provide.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,7,2,476,1,0

However, they did not value me as a customer and their customer service was poor. I felt like I always got the run around whenever I had a question for someone.I absolutely loved their checking features though.

In any case Bank of America has good tellers that provide enough information to their customers. Their policies are much like any other bank so it's very much the same.

Thankfully, my experience has been limited to only my checking account. Bank of America provides all kinds of incentives and offers the latest in smart phone apps. A big plus for Bank of America is their availability. It’s difficult to not run into one of their ATM’s or locations while you’re traveling.

509,patrick sheehan,2012-07-24,1,"Where to start. Bank of America is terrific, absolutely terrific, at making the application and approval process as quick and as simple as possible. After that, though, the whole thing tanks. You can count on everything that you agreed to being amended into something that solely benefits the bank and has no concern for how it may effect you and your credit score. I had taken a personal loan to cover the remaining costs of my final year of college with the intent to pay it off in under 5 years. Needless to say this didn't happen. After approximately 3-6 months of paying on time, my terms and rate were augmented where the payments increased. Luckily, I didn't have too much of an issue with it because I had a good paying job and could handle the change. I have been over paying it off steadily for 5 years with five thousand left on the loan. What changed in the structure of the loan was that since I used the checks they provided and not my own the bank can label the transactions as 'transfer' funds and put a hefty fee and additional interest on the amounts. I called to refinance the loan and they sent me over to an 'independent' debt management company. I signed up with the debt company with their assurance that BoA would agree to the terms and I'd be totally debt free, including outstanding credit cards and the BoA loan, within 4 years. BoA rejected their proposal, I missed a full payment because they took their time in responding so I got a nice $49 fee on top of everything that they already charge me.

514,Tiffany Von Trapp,2012-11-19,1,"This bank doesn't have an awful reputation for fees for no reason. I was away one weekend and was relying on my BoA debit card for purchases. When I got home, I found that, despite my 'available balance' showing as being sufficient for my purchases, a large check was actually processed during the first day I was away, meaning that each of the payments for my purchases was no good. On top of that, I owed BoA close to $500 in overdraft fees. My logic in trying to understand this. How could I use the money out if it wasn't actually available in my account? At the very least, the transactions I made during the weekend should have gone through, and the check itself bounce, but it appears that transactions were processed in a way that would maximize the amount of fees the bank could recover. This was the final straw for me with this Bank. While it was convenient to get 99% of the account signup done online, everything about my experience with the bank was negative since I got the account.

The first amount that I deposited was about a 1000 dollars, which is not that much. However, my intentions were to try and see whether or not this bank truly deserves my trust and my money. Well, I have to admit that the manager whom I talk to at first was entirely focused on my thoughts and objectives, and answered all of my questions with great confidence. Also, I received 35 dollars on my checking account for referring a friend of mine to the bank. Day after day, I started to realize how this bank is convenient because it's almost everywhere, and it offers free service online, where you can check your statement without having to go to the bank.

Being they showed me some loyalty to help me through some hard times I will always show them the same loyalty and utilize them as my #1 Credit Card.,Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,11,19,519,1,0
519,Sandy Carabio,2012-11-19,4,"I've been a Bank of America customer now for a little over 4 years and have not had too many problems with them. I am actually surprised to hear so many people don't like them. I usually just use the ATM for deposits and withdrawal and rarely ever go inside. But when I do, I'm always greeted with a smile and helped in a timely manner. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because their ATM machine does sometimes give me trouble accepting my checks, especially when I submit more than one at a time. But I like the fact that Bank of America was the first bank (I believe) that used the paperless deposits. No more having to write out a deposit slip or use an envelope. I love that about them!",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,11,19,520,1,0
520,Sophia,2014-06-25,4,"I signed up for a Bank of America savings account after seeing a commercial for the Keep the Change program and the promotion for a 100 % match by BofA for the first three months (it is a 5 percent match after the promotion ends). The promotion matched up to $250. Who could pass that up? What the program does is round up your debit card purchases to the next dollar, and the excess amount goes into savings (for example, from a $5.10 purchase, $6 will be deducted from checking and $.90 will go into your savings account.What I did to make sure to reach my match is to go grocery shopping late at night, when there are no crowds, and use the self-checkout to ring items separately or in pairs to make sure that I reached the $250 match. I think I ended up around $230, which was great and kept me as a Bank of America customer. I also really like how you can customize alerts, such as if a deposit has come through or if the amount has dipped below an amount that you can preset. I have a BofA checking account too and transfer $25 from checking to savings every month, which means there is no fee for the savings account.

Right after getting the card I had to buy repairs for my bicycle and earned the $100 cash rewards bonus, which was very competitive and was helpful. I have not used the card for loans or international purchases, and have not had to communicate with customer service.

However, now that I am 23, I either have to maintain a 1500+ balance, have a 250+ direct deposit, or pay a 12 dollar monthly fee. While none of these are outrageous, it is my one qualm about the account. However, I remain loyal to the bank and have no plans to change.

You get two miles for every dollar you spend, which is right up there with the best cards. You can also get 15,000 bonus miles after your first purchase. All of this sounds great, but just remember that Spirit is no the most costumer friendly company around. They were rather unclear about the requirements to get, and keep the bonus miles. You must make a purchase with the card every month to do so. This is no problem for me, it just was not clearly explained to me when I was applying for the card. There is also a annual fee of $60.

However, this is a great card because it offers 3% cash back on purchases made at qualifying gas stations and 1% cash back on other purchases which can add up quickly. It also advertises 2% cash back on groceries, but I usually shop at Walmart and Publix which are not part of the qualifying stores to receive the 2% cash back offer which is kind of annoying.

When I first received the card, I was in college and I did not have much of a credit history to speak of. In that respect, it was nice, but that's one of the few positive things I can mention about it. Bank of America's rates are unreasonably high and you need to be extremely careful to be diligent about your payments. Miss a payment and your rates are likely to double (this is in addition to an exorbitant late fee charge). BoA's website (which I use solely for payment of the Visa) is not very intuitive, but I guess it works once you figure it out. I guess in terms of a basic credit card, this is fine if it's all you qualify for. Then again, I'd be hard pressed to agree to terms that were less customer friendly.

My credit limit started at $800, but was increased to $1000 with a simple call and only a few questions regarding my employment status. It is a rather “bare bones” card in the sense that you don’t get any rewards, but it is very simple to use.

The 1% cash back on all other purchases is pretty standard for a cash rewards card, but in conjunction with the gas and groceries, makes this card very nice overall.

I opened an account while in California visiting my father, because he wanted me to have an account at a bank that was local to him (my usual bank is on the east coast only) so that he could easily deposit money when needed, as he prefers to give me cash instead of items for presents. The problems started when I returned home to NY. I set up one of my direct deposits to go into the account so it wouldn't charge me any fees, but when I went to use my debit card after every 2nd time I used it my card would be flagged as stolen and I wouldn't be able to use it until I called the 800 number. I explained the situation multiple times and asked each time to have a note added to the account saying that I was a student and the card was not stolen every time it was used in NY, and was told each time this was not possible, and my options were either to close the account, wait, and then open a new one in NY and hope that someone depositing cash from California wouldn't get my account flagged, or deal with my debit card being shut down every other time I used the card. Some of the customer service folks I spoke to were friendly and sympathetic, some however were very rude and couldn't understand why anyone would ever spend time in a different state than the one they had opened a bank account in - I guess they've never heard of college students or people who live by state borders or move!I closed the account after 3 months, there were no benefits to the account that were worth putting up with the hassle.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,8,21,553,1,1

I don't have enough experience with the online management systems of other banks to say how they compare, but with BoA it's convenient to see how much money you have in your accounts listed right next to how much you have spent with this credit card. This helps me keep my spending under control and my financial affairs in perfect order. As a recently fiscally-independent young adult, this takes a lot of stress off my mind. For me, using this credit card is the same as using my debit card because it feels like I'm drawing money from MY ACCOUNT (and not putting it on someone else's ledger) and I have yet to carry a balance. The extra advantage of using credit over debit is that I earn points on my purchases.

It not only offers such great usage rates in comparison to other cards I have used, but also allows you to accrue reward points. What initially drew me to this card was the $50 cash back bonus after $500 in purchases within 3 months. It wasn’t the biggest discount, but it did help when I was financially burdened at the time.

After I left, I got this myaccess account. This account is best for working adults that have direct deposit. The direct deposit requirement is so easy to meet if you are paid twice a month. This account is better than the ebanking and below the advantage account. The minimum daily balance is harder to meet since I have bills to pay but since I have direct deposit, it is no worries.

I also like the fact that my statements are now paperless and don't clutter up my mailbox. With Bank of America pretty much everywhere, I can find an ATM pretty easily to withdraw cash when needed. Also, for those who go to China, Construction Bank of China is in partnership with BOA, so you can use their ATM's with no transaction fee. I also LOVE that I can deposit checks through their iPhone app. Quick, simple, and hassle free! Now for what I don't like about Bank of America checking. There are SOOOOO many hidden fees and maintenance charges. If I do not have $250+ direct deposits in my bank account each month, I get charged a penalty. If I take out of my savings more than 2 times a month, penalty. I changed my account type to an online checking only to avoid some of these fees, but if I now go inside the bank to a teller, I get charged a fee.

I have had missing deposits and other problems with my savings account which makes me nervous about the bank overall. The customer service definitely leaves something to be desired. You will be treated like a number on an account and not like a person. I don't know if this is a result of the employees having little control or what, but they don't seem to care about you or any issues you have with the bank. For this reason, I prefer smaller banks and credit unions, but I still have a BoA account because it makes other things easier such as making the mortgage payment which is through BoA",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,11,8,565,1,4

The interest rate on the AAA Member Rewards Credit Card isn't one of the best in the industry, but it will suffice for anyone looking for a general use credit card.

The interest rate on the card is competitive compared to other cash rewards cards on the market, as long as you have decent credit.

As with all banks these days, you are not going to get rich with a savings account, but the rates at BOA seem to be competitive. It is certainly better than having it in checking and earning nothing at all! (or accidentally spending it because you can't tell what you mean to save and what you mean to spend).The online banking feature worked very well, and helped me keep up with balances, deposits, and withdrawals very easily. If you are serious about saving, BOA's savings accounts are a great place to start.

The interest rate is nothing to get excited about, but these days most banks are the same, unless you happen to have a LOT of money and don't plan on touching it for a while, so .01% interest is just fine. I got my savings account mainly as a place to keep money I don't want to touch, and it has been perfect for that. Customer service in my experience has been great, and I've only ever needed to contact them once because I can do basically everything I want all by myself online. Another great thing about Bank of America is just how well the separate accounts link together. I have my Keep The Change from my checking account round up to the nearest dollar and deposit in my savings, and then my rewards from my Bank of America rewards card deposit right into my savings, plus an extra 10 percent! I would give them 5 stars, but the interest rate is too low to warrant that. And yes, there are monthly fees, but only if you have less than $300.

Although the interest rate for me was slightly steep, I credit that with having no credit prior to signing up for it.

Not only was I able to sign up online (you need to verify the account at the local branch eventually) which was a breeze, but also their free checking required no minimum balance. I also signed up for their “keep the change” promotion which works as a virtual piggy bank. Now, every time I use my debit card the card rounds the transaction up to the nearest dollar and transfers the balance of the transaction into my savings account. Only once did I have any issues with my account. A check did not get recorded as deposited. I called their customer service line, and spoke to a live person who helped me through it.

573,Freddie Obregón,2013-03-06,3,"I have three criticisms about this checking account with Bank of America (BoA) and only two of them are big. I had to open this account because this bank is in my home suburb. It was the bank that issued paychecks at my job and was the only bank that was authorized to process electronic transactions at my undergraduate college of The University of Texas. The first criticism out of all of this is that I had to have a minimum of over $1000 in order to keep the account free. As soon as I dipped below this number I had to pay around $11 monthly to keep it open. What a price to pay given the state of our current economy! This bank could learn from Wells Fargo and/or credit unions that offer free checking accounts to college students and the general public, respectively. The second criticism was that when I had to close this account, the workers at the branch made a production out of it, even as to go as far and tell me that I was rude (!). Again, a lesson could be learned from Wells Fargo – when I had to close an account there, the workers gave me no issue. Finally, the last hurdle I had to jump was the money order price: at the time it was around $5 for a money order, but this shock was softened by a nice worker who told me “Oh, you shouldn't get them from here, mi'jo. They're pretty expensive!” Now, THAT'S a lesson that should be taught to all bank employees. More positive news about this checking account was that I had no issue with bank errors or suspicious charges and the like, so that's why my star review is in the “alright” range. All of that said, READER BEWARE: take review with a grain of salt. This was MY experience, not that of anyone else. You could and/or others have good experiences with BoA, so, like with everything, this checking account is not for everyone; it wasn't for me.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,3,6,574,1,2

One of the best rewards cards out there, plus you can buy gift cards and other things with your points too. Try calling Amtrak if you want one though, often you get a bigger sign up bonus.

Obviously, I opened up a savings account that day. The things I like about my savings account are that I can transfer immediately between my checking and savings and that there are no transfer fees between my accounts.

I wish that I could say that I am happy with them but I really am not completely happy. I stay with them mainly for convenience reasons and because it's really a huge pain to switch banks. But, that just means I have been loyal to them, not that they really care. I have a direct deposit to my account. I was away on maternity leave for 6 weeks and wasn't getting paid. They refused to waive the fee for me due to not getting direct deposit for that time. I was a new mom and a single one at that NOT getting paid at all for maternity leave and because I wasn't getting a direct deposit they charged me a fee for my savings account. After being with them for so long that was pretty infuriating.Additionally, they have charged me overdraft fees of $35 when the overdraft had not even occurred! The latest time I was charged for a daycare check that was still processing. I had money in the process of being transferred from my Paypal and the check had not even cleared and they charged the overdraft fee. Even if you overdraft by .50 they charge you a $35 fee. It's sickening. I had to fight with them for WEEKS to get that fee reversed. They refused and refused even though the Paypal money posted BEFORE the check cleared. They argued with me saying the check wasn't what put me over, that a $25 grocery store charge that had already cleared put me over which made no sense because that would only have over drafted me if they check had already been taken out of my account. They just kept talking their way around it.The customer service is ok, not great, just ok. The one thing I can say is that they are good about handling unauthorized charges. They have handled a few fraud cases for me over the past 7 years and they always get me my money back. That is probably a key factor in my staying with them.They have a banking app that is great but it doesn't always completely sync up with what they have in their system so be cognizant of that.Overall, they are ok. If you don't ever have to worry about over drafting or savings account fees, you should be fine.",,wallethub.com,,10,5,598,1,0
598,Michael Samaha,2015-10-02,2,"I've had my checking account with Bank of America for about five years now, and I wish I could say I am satisfied overall, but unfortunately that isn't the case. My overall experience I have to say has been below average - my main issue is that I've more than once been charged an overdraft fee of $35, when I had never actually had my account overdrafted - nor even came close to it. Each time when I brought this ridiculousness to their attention, they rectified the problem and credited my account, but in my opinion mistakes like this are unacceptable and could potentially cause significant problems for a customer, above and beyond the inherent hassles involved with making time to notify them of their errors. What if my account was funded just enough to remit a bill payment I had scheduled when they arbitrarily sucked out $35 from my account on a whim, with zero notice or notification?On the brighter side, BoA's customer service has always been reasonably helpful and attentive whenever I've needed assistance from them.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,10,2,599,1,4

The only fee I've ever gotten was a monthly account fee and a replacement debit card fee, but both were reversed because of good customer service and understanding.I would recommend Bank of America. But I think it's important to note that you need to keep on top of your account (as you should at any bank). Most of the CSRs know what they're doing and are willing to help you.I also had a good experience refinancing my car a few years ago.

I was charged fees for no reason. Twice they charged me overdraft fees when I had not been overdrawn. I called customer service and they were very rude to me. I had never had an experience like that with ANY company before. Once, I did get them to take the fee off but the other time they wouldn't even listen to me. Soon after the second time I canceled my account. I refuse to do business with a company that I don't feel I can fully trust.Overall, I could not recommend Bank of America. I only had a few problems in the 5 years I used Bank of America but it was enough to convince me that it's not the bank for me. The customer service is seriously lacking.

The problems that I have with Bank of America is that they do not seem to stay open very late or on the weekends in most locations. Sometimes I wish they had better rewards as well.

603,Peter Gibson,2013-04-26,2,"I had a checking account with Bank of America for a good while, and for a couple of years everything seemed to be alright. When I began, I started with the usual; checking and savings account. The one major problem with both of those; the fees. Here’s an example of what I mean. On occasion I would make transfers from my savings to my checking in case I needed the money for whatever might pop up. There was one occasion where I knew I had to transfer over a larger sum, and I did. I had a number of bills to pay and some automatic payments set up. I thought everything would be fine. Towards the end of the month I ended up with several fees charged, including a 70 dollar fee for going over the transfer limit no one told me about. Here’s another; I did some work for a friend and was paid by check. My fiance at the time messed up and we had to put a stop payment on it, which was also messed up. So not only did I have a fee for that, I had an overdraft fee because the fee they charged put me in the negative. So my fiance wired some money from her account to try and fix it and got hit with another fee for the wire transfer that no one told me about when I made the account. Their fees, are not only a major source of aggravation, but are annoying to deal with as well. I won’t even get started on the customer service I received. Bank of America is a decent bank for most people. But my experience has turned me back around to credit unions for good.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,4,26,604,1,4
604,James Callahan,2013-04-26,1,"During my time banking with Bank of America, I have personally found their practices to be annoying at best. There have been many times wherein I've had my account frozen because their fraud detection flagged a regular normal purchase. I was on the phone for about 3 hours explaining that, NO, no-one had stolen my information or stolen my cards. The end result was that I had to wait 3 weeks to get a new card even though there was no fraud and had to pay a fee to correct a problem that never existed. I cannot in good conscience recommend this bank to anyone.The fees, charges, and limitations placed on accounts will leave you scratching your head many, many times.The positive side is that the bank is very well known, reputable, and secure, as long as you are willing to put up with the minor annoyances, you shouldn't have too many problems banking with them.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,4,26,605,1,4
605,Marianne Swann,2013-04-26,4,"I have had this card for 11 years now and have had some good and some bad experiences. Overall I would recommend the card though. It has no annual fees, but my card does have a fairly high APR. The issue I've had has been with Bank of America, though I'm not sure if that's who issues all the Norweigan cards or not. They have raised my rate a few times over the years for reasons I really don't understand. I had never been late. When that happened I called to try and get them to lower it but they would not, and did not really have very good customer service. If the card were issued by another bank I would definitely recommend it however as the card does have very good rewards. You can redeem the points for onboard credits, making a reservation or other things through the cruise line. However you can also redeem them for things like gift cards and merchandise., which is great!",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,4,26,606,1,4

I have been with them for about three months now and have not regretted switching over to them when I had moved to a new city and this was their only banking option. Their customer service has been really on par with any of my previous banks, which to me is a really good thing. Their services for checking and savings are about the same as well with the exception to a rewards program that is pretty nifty to have if you like to shop a lot. It seems like they have ATM's everywhere, as I haven't managed to NOT find myself an ATM of theirs when I needed it, so that's a plus for this. They have a great mobile phone APP that allows me to deposit checks straight from home. Overall Bank of America has been really great so far, and I hope it stays this way.

Once it was approved, things were super easy, we received our debit cards and started using them. I love their ATMs and being able to deposit cash and checks with hardly any effort, especially now that I can deposit checks via the mobile app as well.

The 0% period is longer than most (if not all) other balance transfer cards, the balance transfer fee is standard, and there’s no annual fee. So, I don’t really see why anyone would say they didn’t like this card. Either they’re off their rocker or they transferred their balance after the 60-day window to get a 0% rate. Or they didn’t pay on time and got stuck with the card’s high regular rate. Or their application got rejected because they didn’t have an excellent credit score.

Then I get billed for an additional $37.48. I stayed on hold for an hour, talked to 3 people and was given several inaccurate reasons. The more ""customer service managers"" I talked to the more excuses and lies I received. First I did not have the right number, second that payoff amount was just an estimate or that I must have been caught in the billing cycle etc. They would not under any circumstances remove this extra charge from my account. I heard that they were sorry I was frustrated, and a plethora of other horrible platitudes. I would highly recommend considering any other company but bank of America.

650,Margie Cole,2012-05-10,2,"Pretty good advice, fellas. Overall it seems like BofA launched these new BankAmericards with travel rewards just to throw a bone to frequent travelers who were getting cards from other companies, and what they came up with are poor imitations of some already popular products. The BankAmericard Privileges with Travel Rewards is just a more expensive Venture Card and this BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is just the Capital One Cash Rewards Card but with points and travel branding. So if you came to this page wondering if you should get the BankAmericard Travel Rewards Card, you have your answer.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,5,10,651,1,3
651,Joe Weider,2012-05-09,4,"Out of the three travel rewards credit cards that Bank of America just launched, this is the option geared toward small business owners (obviously). To get a true sense of this card’s place in the business credit card hierarchy, I think it’s important to remember that BofA is the only credit card company that abides by the rules of the CARD Act, at least as far as interest rates are concerned. Other companies can raise your interest rates on debt you haven’t paid off yet whenever they want. Bank of America only does that if you miss two payments. The advice I’ve seen based on this is that you can either use a single Bank of America business credit card for small business or a standard credit card for funding and a business card for making smaller purchases and earning rewards.With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at the WorldPoints Travel Rewards for Business Visa Credit Card. It doesn’t have an annual fee, which is nice, gives you 1.5 points per dollar you charge and 5,000 bomus points after your first purchase, and has 0% on purchases for 9 months. As far as rewards are concerned, the WorldPoints Travel Rewards Business Credit Card doesn’t really compare to some of the other business cards out there. I mean, the Capital One Spark Cash for Business gives you 2% cash back on all purchases and a $100 initial bonus, and sure, it has a $59 annual fee beginning in the second year, but you can recoup that after spending $2950. The Ink Cash Business Card from Chase is another great option since it offers a $250 initial bonus, 5% cash back on the first $25k you spend on office supplies and telecom, 3% on the first $25k spent on gas and dining, and 1% on everything else. Like the BofA WorldPoints Travel Card, it doesn’t have an annual fee either.Overall, I’d say get the WorldPoints Travel Rewards Business Visa if you want the simplicity of using one card for business, but you can get a whole lot more value with the Ink Cash for Business and a 0% card like the Citi Simplicity.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,5,9,652,1,2
652,Joe Weider,2012-05-09,4,"The BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is I guess the standard option in Bank of America’s new suite of travel rewards credit cards (I mean the other consumer card has Privileges in the name and the WorldPoints Card is for business). Anyway if you’re looking for a travel rewards credit card, you need to figure out whether the BankAmericard Travel Rewards Card is going to be the most rewarding option in light of your spending habits and interests (you don’t want a card that gives you hotel rewards if you never stay at hotels).As you can see from the top of this page, the Travel Rewards BankAmericard gives you a 10,000 point initial bonus. I looked at the terms and conditions page, and you get these if $500 in purchases post to your account within the first 90 days. You also get 1.5 points per dollar spent across all purchases, which you can ultimately redeem for travel purchases that appear on your statement. (You can also redeem for cash, merchandise and charitable contributions, but I don’t know if you get the same value that way). Aside from the 0% on purchases the BofA Travel Rewards Card offers, that’s basically it for its benefits. You also get 3 points per dollar spent on travel purchased through BofA, but prices are usually jacked up on credit card travel programs, so I doubt this is much of a benefit.When you get down to it, this new Bank of America Travel Credit Card is decent. Whether it’s the right card for you depends. The Capital One Venture Card is a better option for people who want a card for just one year or who spend a lot on travel because it offers 2 miles for every $1 but has a $59 annual fee starting in the second year (the Travel BankAmericard doesn’t have an annual fee). If you want the best possible initial bonus, I’d go with the Chase Sapphire Preferred ($500). And if you don’t travel that much or always use the same airline or hotel chain, I’d get the Blue Cash Preferred Amex or the card tied to your favorite travel provider. Aside from that, the BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is a good option, so get it if you travel a moderate amount and won’t be able to earn enough with another card to warrant paying its annual fee.I’d love to see what Won Buddy Lee has to say about this card too!",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,5,9,653,1,2
653,Joe Weider,2012-05-09,4,"Bank of America is giving the people what they want: travel rewards. Travel rewards cards are some of the flashiest and most sought after cards issuers offer and BofA launched THREE new offers in ONE day. That’s a lot to digest, but I’ll give breaking down these offers a whirl, starting with the BankAmericard Privileges with Travel Rewards Credit Card. Don’t thank me, it’s my PRIVILEGE (ha, I crack myself up).The BankAmericard Privileges Card is obviously focused on travel rewards, as I’m sure you can tell from its name. It doesn’t offer any 0% introductory interest rates either. It does give you two rewards points for each dollar you spend across all purchases and lets you redeem them for travel purchase made anywhere rather than forcing you to redeem them through a BofA rewards site or something. You might think this seems eerily similar, and you’d be right. Tha Capital One Venture Card offers basically the same rewards program, right down to the 10,000 point initial bonus. Unlike the Venture Card though, the Privileges BankAmericard charges a $75 annual bonus beginning in the second year, while the Venture Card only charges $59.As you might guess, I am still a bigger fan of the Venture Card as far as ongoing rewards are concerned. Neither boxes you in in terms of logistics, though, which is nice. Finally, let me say that if you want a card that will help you benefit this summer, I wouldn’t choose either the Bank of America Travel Rewards Privileges Card or the Venture Card. I’d probably pick the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card instead.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,5,9,654,1,2
654,Margie Cole,2012-04-23,4,"As far as I’m concerned, people have three things to consider when deciding whether an everyday rewards card like the Bank of America Accelerated Rewards American Express Card is right for them: 1) How it compares to similar cards currently being offered; 2) How well it complements your spending habits; and 3) How convenient maximizing its rewards offerings will be. So let’s go one by one.1. How it Compares.Since the BofA Accelerated Rewards Amex Card only gives you a $50 initial bonus and 1.25 points per $1 spent, it’s rewards really aren’t competitive. You can find cards offering a couple free flights, hotel nights, and up to $500 as initial bonuses; 1.5-2% cash back across all purchases; and up to 6% cash back on major spending categories like gas and groceries.So if rewards are what youre after I’d go with the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card, the Cap One Venture, the PenFed Platinum Rewards, or the American Express Blue Cash Preferred instead of the Bank of America Accelerated Rewards Card.2.	How it complements.This card doesn’t offer any special rewards earning rates for specific spending categories, so it complements everyone’s spending the same. This could make it a good everyday rewards card if it had attractive rewards, but since it doesn’t, it’s just a missed opportunity considering that you can save 5% on gas with the PenFed Card or 6% on groceries with the Amex Blue Cash Preferred.3.	ConvenienceIm not a big fan of cards that give rewards in points. Cash back rewards are much more straightforward and do not require you to redeem often to avoid seeing your points become worth less when the credit card company ups the number you need for certain rewards. This probably wont be a big deal, but you also cant use Amex cards as many places as you can Visa or MC.Overall, the Bank of America Accelerated Rewards Amex is a fine card, especially since it doesn’t have an annual fee, but you can do better.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,4,23,655,1,0
655,Margie Cole,2012-04-16,4,"The BankAmericard Cash Rewards Card is an interesting offer. The reason why is that for some people, it is a really great option that will prove very lucrative, but for others it wont quite measure up to the best cards on the market. It all really depends on how much you spend on gas and groceries and whether or not you bank with Bank of America. This will become a bit more clear with a quick little pro/con list for the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Card.Pros-	Many cards offer more lucrative initial bonuses than the Bankamericard Cash Rewards Visa’s $50, but they also tend to require that you spend a few thougsand dollars in the first few months. This card’s bonus is much more attainable for less heavy spenders since you only need to spend $100 in the first 60 days to get it.-	Cash back rewards are always a plus because you know exactly what youre going to get. 3% on gas, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else is pretty good too…IF you only spend around $1500 on gas and groceries every three months.-	Getting a 10% rewards bonus is a great treat for Bank of America bank account holders as well.-	Having 0% for 12 months can also allow you to leave more money in the bank for longer and gain good interest.-	Having no annual fee on a card that offers good rewards is also pretty nice.Cons-	Since you only get the 2%/3% rates up to $1500 spend on gas and groceries combined each quarter, the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Visa Card will turn into a 1% cash back card when you hit this milestone.-	There are a few other cards out there that offer better rewards on gas and groceries.The BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card is a pretty good everyday spending credit card, but before you apply for it I suggest also checking out the Blue Cash Preferred from American Express and the PenFed Platinum Rewards Card to see which would be more lucrative for your particular spending habits.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,4,16,656,1,0
656,Joe Weider,2012-03-09,3,"Man, I bet a bar association credit card could buy a heck of a lot of drinks. Oh, wait…it’s not that kind of bar...it’s lawyers. Oh, well, still applies. That awful lawyer joke I made up as I was writing it aside, if you’re an American Bar Association member, you might be interested in showing your affiliation by getting an American Bar Association Business Credit Card. You shouldn’t really think of it as the American Bar Association Business Credit Card though; think of it instead as Credit Card X and evaluate it based on its terms rather than its name. In other words, you don’t want to overpay for credit card branding. Starting with rewards, the American Bar Association Business Card offers 1 rewards point per $1 spent. That’s it. Moving on to rates, the Bar Association Business Card gets you 0% on purchases for 9 months. That’s it. As you can probably tell, I’m not wild about the Bar Association Card. At this point you might be thinking, “what are you talking about, it gives you rewards and a 0% intro rate, what more could you ask for?” First of all, you don’t want to settle for an average overall card because it meets two needs. It would be much smarter to get a rewards card for everyday spending and a 0% card for saving on big ticket purchases or transferring debt. You’d get better terms overall that way. Also, there are simply way better cards that you can get with the good or excellent credit you need to get the Bar Association Credit Card.What are those cards, you ask? Well, if you want rewards, I’d go with the business credit card offering the best terms of your biggest expenses. The Ink Bold with Ultimate Rewards and the American Express Simply Cash Card are pretty good options. If you want low rates, I’d go with the No Balance Transfer Fee Slate Card from Chase, which offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 15 months and does not charge a transfer fee. Yes, that is a personal credit card, that is intentional. You aren’t put at any additional risk by using a personal credit card and get to benefit from the fact that issuers cannot increase interest rates on personal credit card unless you’re at least 60 days delinquent.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,3,9,657,1,4
657,Joe Weider,2012-03-08,3,"Diamondback fans have gotta be wondering, will Trevor Bauer make the opening day rotation or assume a role in it shortly thereafter and would the Arizona Diamondbacks Credit Card make a good addition to your wallet? As far as Bauer is concerned, he’ll have to work for it, but he should soon join Hudson and Kennedy in the rotation. Deciding whether or not to get the Diamondbacks Credit Card depends on what exactly it offers since you do not want to overpay for branding, especially when you can personalize the entire front side of any Capital One credit card with the picture of your choosing and effectively turn it into a Diamondbacks Credit Card. The Diamondbacks Credit Cards rewards are as follows: 3% cash back on gas, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else and a 10% rewards bonus when you redeem your cash back into a Bank of America bank account. In terms of rates, the Diamondbacks Card offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 15 months but charges a 4% balance transfer fee.The rewards offered by the Diamondbacks Credit Card are pretty good, especially if you already have or can get a free Bank of America bank account. However, most people probably spend more on groceries than they do on gas, so for them the Blue Cash Everyday Card from Amex would be better since it offers 3% cash back at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores and 1% on everything else. The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card also offers a $500-625 initial bonus, which makes it a good option. The rates offered by the No Balance Transfer Fee Slate Card from Chase are also attractive. It gives you 0% on purchases and transfers for the same 15 months as the Diamondbacks Credit Card but does not charge any transfer fee.

658,Joe Weider,2012-03-07,3,"Hey, I’ll tell ya what this is one credit card with some Natitude. While I’m certainly an entrenched Yankees fan, I can appreciate the fact that the Nationals are poised for big things, I’m just mad we didn’t keep Tyler Clippard. Anyway, you’re here because you want to see if the Nationals Credit Card is worth applying for and the biggest concern you should have is about overpaying for branding. Basically you don’t want to sacrifice money or card terms just to have a Nats symbol emblazoned on your card, especially since you can make that happen for free with any Capital One credit card. That being said lets take a gander at what the Washington Nationals Credit Card has to offer. Starting with rewards, the Nats Credit Card gives you 3% cash back on gas, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else. You also get a 10% rewards bonus if you redeem your cash back into a Bank of America bank account. How does this stack up to the rest of the good or excellent credit credit card market?Pretty well, actually. The Amex Blue Cash Everyday Card, which is one of the best everyday rewards cards, offers 3% cash back at supermarkets, 2% cash back at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on everything else. I guess which one is better depends on whether you spend more on groceries or gas and how much you spend at department stores. As far as rates are concerned, the Nationals Credit Card offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 12 months but charges a 4% balance transfer fee. This does not compare favorably to the likes of the No Balance Transfer Fee Slate Card from Chase, which doesn’t have a transfer fee and gives 0% on purchases and transfers for 15 months. Ultimately, I’d probably have to take both alternatives to the Nationals Credit Card instead of it because unlike a Stephen Strasburg fastball, it doesn’t blow me away.

659,Joe Weider,2012-03-07,3,"For all you O’s fans out there, its unfortunately pretty clear that your team is going to be, well, terrible this year and for the foreseeable future. After all, the destructive management is still in place and ESPN did pick the O’s last in its future rankings. What remains to be seen however is whether the Baltimore Orioles Credit Card is doomed for the same fate or could be a home run, so to speak. Usually I’d take you through the Orioles Credit Cards’ terms before revealing the answer, but I sympathize with you guys so I’ll tell you now. The Orioles Rewards Card has the same terms as all of the other MLB-team-branded credit cards and while pretty good they are not necessarily the best available for people with good or excellent credit (what the O’s Credit Card and other teams’ cards require for approval). Here, I’ll show you why.The Orioles Card offers 3% cash back on gas, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else. Compare this to a card like the Blue Cash Everyday from American Express, which offers 3% at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on everything else and it doesn’t quite stack up. I mean I suppose the O’s card could be better for people who spend more on gas than groceries and never shop at department stores, especially people with Bank of America bank accounts because the MLB Team credit cards give you a 10% rewards bonus when you deposit your cash back into one. At any rate, I’d probably take the Chase Sapphire Preferred over the Orioles Card because the former gives you a $500-625 initial bonus. The difference between the Orioles Credit Card’s rates and those of the best good or excellent credit credit cards is even more obvious. The Orioles Card offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 12 months but also charges a 4% balance transfer fee. The No Balance Transfer Fee Slate Card, on the other hand, obviously doesn’t charge any sort of fee for transfers and offers 0% on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months. On other thing to point out is that if Orioles branding is all you’re looking for, any Capital One credit card allows you to customize the front of your card with the picture of your choosing, so you can of course slap an O’s logo or picture on there.

They've gone throught the occasional changes where my free checking has been changed to a non-free account, but they've always given me plenty of warning and I've never had trouble switching it back to one of the free options. The telephone wait time for customer service is sometimes excessive though (40 minutes last time I called. I remember this stuff!), but the reps are always polite and eager to help.I'm a pretty casual banking user, though, since I mostly just use the account for simple things like paying bills and making debit purchases as I do my investing elsewhere with companies who do that exclusively.I've found Bank of America's automatic bill-pay setup to be especially easy to use. They'll send checks on my behalf to the people I owe when I schedule it, though I would expect that's true of any bank these days and I can't remember if this last has an extra fee, though. I'm pretty sure it doesn't for what I use it for.Identity theft protection has been great, too.

BoA offers services to deposit checks and money via the ATM, so I assumed there would be no reason I would need a person.Unfortunately, I was wrong. At one point, my debit card number was stolen and so I was forced to cancel my card. I was promptly notified by BoA to call them, which was quite nice so points for BoA. After I called I was reassured that my mailing address was updated from Ohio to California and that my old card was cancelled and a new one would arrive within the week. The card took two weeks so I was forced to incur multiple fees as a result of having to go into the bank to access my money. The bank would not waive the fees, even though I did not have a choice. Additionally, they sent me NOT a new card, but just a copy of the same old card. I continued racking up fraudulent charges this whole time, in addition to the account fees.

I see with pressure from the community after their bailout they decided to not do that. However they have charges for just about everything on a regular account. From too many transfer fees to monthly fees. Which they have raised twice since I have been a customer.The good stuff:1. They are quick to help if someone has gotten a hold of your debit card or card number. I have never had a problem getting my money refunded with BOA if something goes wrong.2. Long customer service hours. If I need help in the evening they are usually there up till 7 or 8. Which is nice for customers. I also enjoy their online chat. It's very helpful. Although if you are looking to get a charge removed I would call your local branch. Because once they tell you no online or over the phone via their 1-800 number the local branch can't do anything for you. Just a tip, I learned this the hard way.3.

I faced this issue a month back when unauthorized transactions were constantly being posted to my account. I had over 50 transactions being posted every day, transactions that I had not made or authorized. The amount of the transactions was quite small, but the fact that they were constantly being posted worried me. I called Bank of America and discussed this with them. Their customer service representative spent more than an hour confirming all the transactions with me and whether or not I had actually authorized them. At the end, the issue was sorted out and the entire amount was credited to my account. While this was not the first time that such charges were posted on the account, Bank of America has been supportive each time and has done everything to sort the issue as soon as possible.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,4,16,672,1,2

There are no hidden fees as long as you stay above the required balance. However there are a couple cons. One of those is the poor customer service. The regular employees who answer phones and deal with you at the desk are flunkies who can’t really help you, so you have to wait to talk to their superiors.

At the time I didn’t know much about investing nor savings accounts but I liked the idea of putting aside as much money as possible for savings. Well, that’s what I did with the account, but with a checking account with Bank of America, you soon realize it is more of a liability than an asset with the amount of fees, charges and whatnot. I found myself constantly having to transfer from savings to checking which, of course, was subject to the transfer limit between accounts. And to top it all off, the pathetic interest rate I was getting with the savings account meant that there was simply no point to keeping any money in that account. I soon wizened up, closed the account and put my savings elsewhere, somewhere where I actually get a return on my savings.",Bank of America Savings & CDs,wallethub.com,male,4,14,676,1,0

One of the charges originated in South Dakota and the other charge originated in Mexico! Since I've never been to either of those places and had not recently purchased anything in those amounts online, I called B of A immediately. I was told that both of the charges were showing that an actual debit card was swiped! Apparently, my debit card had been cloned and several people were attempting to verify that I had funds in my account. B of A cancelled my card immediately. The one thing that did bother me, however, was that the bank could not remove the charges until they were no longer ""pending"". That made me very nervous.

The main reason I canceled my account was because of their ridiculous fees. The bank account would not post transactions for days and then put them all through at one time. This often resulted in multiple overdraft fees due to the ""available balance,"" which I would view prior to making purchases / paying bills, would not include pending transactions. It seemed like Bank of America was out to get as much of my money as it could, and it was not apologetic when I was faced with a financial difficulty because of this.

You also get the bonus of 10% extra if you transfer the bonus into another BoA savings account, which doesn't end up being a ton of money, but once again, it is easily earned.I would totally recommend this card to anyone that can afford to pay it off in time, as the interest rate is high.

It’s a little disappointing that you only get $50 cash back after you spend $500 within 90 days of getting it. I know when I first got my American Express Gold card, I got $150 for doing a similar task. It’s nice that there is a grace period for late fees of $25 because you never know when you might need some extra time to pay a bill.

Unlike a lot of cards it doesn't have a limit on the amount of points you can earn in a year. It also doesn't have a yearly fee which has started to become more common with point reward credit cards. The interest rate of 14 percent is about standard but on the low side for a point card. The cash advance is a little lower than most cards as well at 23 percent. The best thing about this card however is the point system. The bare minimum amount of points you earn for every dollar is 50 percent more than almost every card, you can even earn triple on a lot of purchases.

One time I had a fraudulent charge of 2,500$ and they immediately took it off and made things right.

Some credit cards charge a sign up fee, this one actually gives you a bonus for signing up. And the APR is really good, the intro APR for the first year is 0%, but , and only 12.99-22.99 after a year which is not bad at all.The only thing I don’t like about this card is that the cash advance fee is very high.

720,Shaneeka Anderson,2015-07-30,4,"I've had a savings account with Bank of America for over 10 years now. When I first started, it was due to a feature they no longer offer (that I know of, as it has stopped happening on my account). Every transaction with your debit card resulted in funds automatically being rounded up to the next dollar and the difference between that amount and the actual transaction transferred to your savings account. As a result, I built a nice savings balance without much effort on my part. I have automatic transfers set up from my checking account to savings, and when it gets to a certain amount I move it to a savings CD. The rate on the CD is much better than that of the regular savings account, but the funds are not as easily accessible. Because of this, I enjoy those options. It feels good knowing money you would just have sitting around gaining interest can gain a bit more when transferred over to another savings product with a higher rate. All in all, I'm satisfied with my Bank of America savings account. I just wish they'd bring back the transaction rounding.",Bank of America Savings & CDs,wallethub.com,female,7,30,721,1,3

I qualified for the Better Balance Rewards card, which gives me $30 every quarter so long as I pay more than the minimum monthly balance every month (it's $25 a quarter for non-BoA banking customers).

729,erica d,2015-07-14,5,"I love this bank. I currently have two banks, one that is linked to my family's account, and this one that I use as my personal bank. I primarily got this bank to obtain a credit card, but I have since moved away from my other bank to solely use this one. I think it has a lot of strengths on its own, but especially in comparison. The interface of the website is friendly, appealing and is functional. Every bit of information I could want from statements, account information, important numbers, and ways to sign up for other programs or open accounts is right there. Customer service is very quick. I have used both the online chat and telephone calls for help with an issue with instant service. I had an issue where I was over drafted for an unauthorized charge and I wasn't aware of it. After using the card a few times, I had an even larger overdraft due to insufficient funds - but all due an unauthorized charge. I called and everything was immediately fixed and smoothed over.Another situation happened that I can't quite remember how it all panned out, but since I had been responsible with that account and the credit account linked, they had given me a benefit for being a good customer. Bank of America has not left me in the dust like my other bank has, and has made it a point to emphasize its appreciation for me being a customer. I don't think customer affirmation is necessarily important, after all I'm being offered a service that is functional, but it makes me feel a lot closer to the bank.Other local things, the hours for the banks meet my needs whenever I need to talk to someone, and I like that I can make deposits through the ATM.

All of my previous cards required an annual fee, and it is a nice surprise to see this one doesn't.

This card is also for students that are some of the brightest in the nation, so this card would be really goof for students it won't cost them much.

I do like the fraud liability protection, though, as that can definitely come in handy in this day and age. I would recommend this card to friends and family as it's not incredibly bad, but it's not that great either. 3 Stars is a fair rating for this card because it's a very average card.

I’ve had other cards in the past that had an intro rate, but never 12 months long. The rewards are good, but not as good as cash back. I prefer my Bank of America cash back card rewards over NYU University Alumni American Express point rewards which really limit what you can do with your reward.

Also, having the ability to earn reward points with every dollar I spend is pretty nice too. It's pretty common, but not having any annual fee, and having the type of fraud protections that this card offers is a comforting thing.

This includes Keep the Change, an optional program that takes the extra cents off every debit card purchase and puts it in your savings account. Additionally, you can set up Bill Pay through the checking account, which is very convenient.The customer service for the account has been awesome, too -- typically a quick response, and they have even forgiven an overdraft fee once or twice. I'm very happy with this account.I do wish there was a way to avoid the foreign fees, such as ATM and transactions while abroad.

They have branches everywhere, ATMs in every store and great online banking options. The process was simple to sign up and done quickly. The customer services is decent put I would never say great. I've had some problems with some transactions that could have been solved quicker but they did eventually get resolved. My favorite thing is the cost. I have a checking and savings account with them at no cost as long as I keep a hundred dollars in the bank. All together I really do like them I just wished they would be a bit more helpful.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,10,3,756,1,3
756,William,2013-10-03,4,"I think this card has some decent benefits but is also lackluster in other areas. The rewards system seems rather robust, offering between 1 and 3 points per dollar spent (depending on the items purchased). It also offers a 25-day grace period on purchases, which seems to be what other cards offer.If I had to choose something I don't like about the card, it's the percentage rate on balance transfers. I've seen other cards offer lower introductory rates on balance transfers, some going as low as 0. Everything else about the card seems to be in line with what other cards offer, which to me, makes this card a rather average offering.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,10,3,757,1,3
757,Preston Sawyer,2013-10-03,4,"The BankAmericard Cash Back credit card is another card in the lineup of rewards cards these days. It is also a very attractive option in its very straightforward rewards scheme. The bonus of $100 in the first 90 days if purchasing $500 of products is a nice perk. The rates are also comparable to other cards in its bracket, and based on your credit worthiness, you could get a quite good rate for a rewards card. Not having to worry about annual fees and the 0% annual rate for the first 12 months are a great reason to pick up this card if you are in the market for a rewards card.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,10,3,758,1,3

Customer service is always very helpful when I need to speak to someone, which isn't often. I also like the rewards program a lot. I've redeemed my points many times over the years and gotten some really cool stuff. They've been very forgiving to me when I miss a payment. It's happened a few times, and they always try to help me out so I don't get stuck with excess fees.

Except for the travel and purchase offers, I don't see much benefits one would get out of the Bank Americard. Maybe we could add it in our kitty just for the sake of travel and use it for huge purchases as well. The Grace period is 25 days and thats great.

I work 9 to 5 and find myself waiting for hours on the phone to speak to someone. I have a really good credit score for a young person and was calling to ask questions on getting a better credit card with a lower interest rate. I never got through to them over the phone so I gave up. I also have a checking account with them and that has been very smooth sailing.

770,Nicole Stacy,2014-08-14,3,"My Bank of America checking account almost always performs the way it should. However, when there's a problem, there's REALLY a problem. My last large issue is that my debit card was voided by the bank more than a year before it expired, however I never received the debit card they sent out to replace it. As a result, I ended up having a late payment on my credit card with them because they would not receive an electronic payment from my student credit union. After having gone to the bank they explained that, had the debit card been stolen, I would not have been liable for any charges against my account but had no explanation for why they would send out another debit card without notifying me.Thankfully it only took one hour of waiting and nearly forty-five minutes speaking with a person inside the bank, something that I am always wary of doing because they are within their rights to charge me for such a service because of how this account is set up, to right the late payment as well. After all, I informed them that I had initiated the payment with my CU nearly two weeks before so that it wouldn't be late.All in all, it does the job.

780,Rachel,2013-04-12,2,"Ten years ago, I opened my very first checking account at Bank of America. At first I loved them and the service was great, however that went downhill quickly. For the first few months there were no service fees, everything was just how they explained it would be. Then the random service fees- that I was told I would not have to worry about- started. Monthly maintenance fees, fees for not having enough in my account, fees for having too much in my account... I could never keep track, but they were always charging me for something. I ended up getting fed up with their monthly fees so I stopped using my account, only to come back months later and discover they had been tacking on an overdraft fee each time a monthly fee was applied to my account. I had stopped using my account, so I didn't notice this until I was $300+ overdrawn. Thankfully their customer service is not that bad, it was fixed for me and I started using my account again. Then things got really bad. For example oftentimes, transactions would not post right away, so when I checked my account online it would look like I had more money than I did. Once I accidentally overdrew my account by .04 cents, and was charged a $30 overdraft fee. Instead of putting a stop on the card, or at the very least calling/emailing to warn about the card being overdrawn, they would keep adding overdraft fees for each day my account was negative, and each time you used my debit card. Since it looked like the money was in there when I checked my account, I didn't think I was overdrawing my account. Again, customer service was generally pretty understanding the first couple times this happened. But it seemed like no matter how careful I was, I was constantly overdrawn. Recently I stopped using my account because I feel like I have lost (or almost lost) so much money to them. I am currently shopping around for a new bank that does not have outrageous fees.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,4,12,781,1,4

I use the app to transfer funds between my two accounts and to easily wire money to family members out of state if needed. The user interface both on a computer and iPhone app are very easy to use and I am grateful that they have good developers working for us.When I signed up, the process was easy and I really appreciated when they changed my account type based on my actual usage. This helped save me a little in fees each year. I also have had great in-person experience when I have had to go into a branch to order a new card or perform a transaction.My only point of contention with my bank is their conflict resolution and difficulty in dealing with the fraud protection system. I had some odd activity, some my fault and some not, that resulted in NSF fees. They would only partially forgive the ones that were not my fault. I have never asked for fee forgiveness when I was at fault but they did not help me out much at all in that case. The fraud protection can be trying. It is an automatic system and, in my case, I made an emergency midnight run to Walmart while on vacation and was locked out of my account until the next business day when I could get a person on the phone.

I did not have time to explain the banking system and interest to the teller but it probably didn't matter.My checks specifically have increased at least 15% every time I need to replace them. Both checks and cashiers should be free, especially if they are taking the money out of my account on the spot.To be fair, they will try to meet you with a smile at the front desk.

Naturally, I immediately found someone else to finish the A/C work and learned just how dishonest the first vendor was. When I disputed the charge, BoA took their time in reaching out to me and then made me fill out 10pages of information and asked for unreasonable documentation that was impossible to acquire due to the length of time (over a week) passed by then. They wanted a second opinion, on letterhead (not an invoice) detailing the problem and what the original vendor did wrong.A.) The problem had been repaired by then you bureaucratic morons!B.) The second vendor wanted nothing to do with a formal statement on fancy letterhead - that he didn’t even have!In its place, I presented the second invoice AND a notarized affidavit based on the suggestion of the BoA rep.

795,en142798,2017-09-28,1,"This card is terrible. When I first got the card, it was secured and through the bank account I had with them. I put $300 down to secure the line of credit and was told that if I used it and made all of the payments on time and had a zero balance at the year mark, they would graduate it for me and turn it into an unsecured card and I'd get my deposit back. That was in 2013. I applied every year and finally at the beginning of this year, I got my graduation. I have had good credit for the last two of those years. I've never missed a payment and I haven't carried a balance on this card since right before the year mark, so 2014. Every time I've used it since, I have paid it off immediately. When they graduated me, I was approved for a $500 limit and a $39 annual fee, and this card has never had any rewards. I haven't been able to get an increase to save my life and they won't lower the interest rate or remove the fee. I called to ask and they said it was because I have serious delinquencies on my credit. I have two very old accounts in collections that are about to fall off that have not affected my ability to grow my credit score to a beautiful 700+, pick up the American Express every day blue cash card (no annual fee), Chase Sapphire with an $11,000 limit, or the ever difficult to obtain CapitalOne VentureOne card (also with no annual fee) and a $5,000 limit. Clearly I can handle my credit, but I don't know what Bank of America is doing. When I asked them to close my account, they happily said okay. This is funny because just 20 minutes prior, I requested to close my CreditOne card. I feel I have outgrown this card. They fought so hard to keep me with an annual fee refund and the possibility that I'll be able to wipe out some of the features of this card I don't like. More on that in February when I call in and request it, but, I found it a touch disheartening that the Bank of America people didn't even try to keep my business and the really kind of horrible CreditOne people did (the card is horrible, not the people). So, there is my review... take it for what it is worth. Don't be surprised if you kinda get treated like the scum of the Earth even after you've built your credit into the skies. Closing a card never felt so good.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,,9,28,796,1,3

I started off with $1000 CL, I submit a credit line increase every 6 months and I was up to $25k. When I brought my house last year, I charged all my new house expenses (washer, dryer, wood flooring, landscaping, window treatment...) on this card. With all the reward I saved up. It's perfect for a new TV. When I'm ready for TV shopping, I'd got a letter from them and stated my Visa account are being closed due to all the unusual activity with my account and they consider I'm a risk to the bank. And the very worst thing was all cash reward were gone, ""forfeited"" is the term. I call and spoke to every single soul at the customer service, supervisor, and managerment. I explain the situation to them and offer pay the entire balance at once. Unfortunately, According to them nothing they can do once account are closed, so is all the cash reward. I question them why wouldnt they contact me first or at least give me a chance to explain what's going on? All I got from them was they were sorry.

She then showed me how to use the ATM and online services until I felt comfortable. I absolutely feel comfortable going back.

I was charged random fees with them all of the time. Every time I checked my bank account I was missing some money somehow. I think its really unfair to be charged fees by a bank when they already makes money off of your money in the first place. I do love how high-tech their ATM machines are. They are very convenient when making deposits such as checks and money because of the way they are designed. The bad outweighs the good with BOA.

The rewards have always come within a few days.The Bank of America customer service is excellent. A few times I have been double charged by merchants and after calling Bank of America, the second charge as removed within minutes.

Purchases are pulled from available balance immediately so I never have to second guess where I stand as far as money goes. I have enjoyed being a Bank of America customer so much. I also have used their bill pay option and it is very easy to set up and use, the money gets extracted right away so again, there is no wonder in my mind of how long it will take to show I have less than what I paid.

Besides that, their representatives have always been there to help me the moment I walked in that door. The first time I signed up with Bank of America was a breeze.

We had recently opened an account with Chase but decided to cancel that account as we had a rather serious issue that they preferred to run circles around, but Bank of America seems committed to doing the opposite of that. Bank of America is also very convenient as they have ATM's almost everywhere. In addition to that their online banking service has been phenomenal.

When I tried to get these fees waived, they told me that there was nothing that they could do because they were valid bank fees.

815,Gregory,2013-04-12,2,"I was with Bank of America for quite some time a few years ago. The number of branch locations and ATMs available made it my first choice. They were close to my work, and near where I lived, so getting to the bank was never a problem. Even after I moved to another city, there were still plenty of available locations. The problems I have are with their problem resolution and new card policies.I lost my wallet a major mall, and as such, cancelled my cards. Bank of America issued a new one to me without delay, and I received the card a few days later. However, they had issued me a card with the exact same number as the on the that was lost. Shortly afterwards, a few suspicious charges popped up on my account. I called to have them deleted, but they said that since I had not reported that card lost or stolen, (Since it had the same number), and the purchases were made at a POS terminal, they would not reverse a charge I had made. At the time the transactions were made, I was at work, and could prove that point, but I spent over a year arguing with Bank of America, before I finally gave up and closed my account.I was also not happy with the amount you could overdraft your account at an ATM. I paid my bills through Money Orders, and would go to the ATM to withdraw the money. Twice, I miscalculated the amount in my account, and was able to withdraw money up to $300 over what I had in the bank.Overall, I do not think that Bank of America is a good bank to choose for security or safety when it comes to your money.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,4,12,816,1,4

There are many branches, which is obviously very convenient. Most branches operate during the hours one would expect for a bank and are outfitted with ATMs. In 20 years with Bank of America I have never encountered a teller that failed to be friendly and helpful. I have procured an auto loan for them in past. I don’t recall the interest rates, but I do remember that it was fair and competitive. The online experience with Bank of America is also extremely satisfactory with up-to-the-minute transaction history as well as the ability to transfer funds between accounts. I am pleased enough with Band of America that I have never seriously considered moving to another bank.

Bank of America was the most convenient option. With offices and ATMs all across the United States, I was able to quickly and easily get money from my parents back home. The savings and checking infrastructure was easy, and I am still to this day impressed by the envelope-free check deposits at ATM machines. Even when I came back after my initial internship, I kept my Bank of America account open, and I maintain it to this day (even though I no longer need my parents to send me money...but if they're reading this, they should feel more than welcome to do so).I encountered no troubles with my Bank of America account, and the fast, convenient and free services were and still are of tremendous utility to me.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,12,19,821,1,2

It really put my stresses at rest. When it comes to Customer Service they're not so bad, either. When my husband needs to ask questions, or check his account over the telephone they're very polite and always willing to help.

I hadn't so much as been with them for a month before I saw my first fee on my account – a 'checking account maintenance' fee!

Overdraft fees used to be a serious concern, because of the way the bank processes them. When I did get hit with fees, they usually racked them up 4 or 5 right on top of each other. Getting them resolved was usually a matter of a simple phone call.At one point I had my information stolen and someone began making unauthorized purchases with my card. Within 12 hours of calling the number I had a new card and every penny of the money that the thief spent was restored in full to my account.Recently I had problems with my credit card, and the bank has been extremely cooperative in helping me resolve my payments. As long as you have a good knowledge of what your payments are and you're working to pay them off (even if not in full), then you will usually find them agreeable to different terms.Overall, I am satisfied with the services I get from my bank, but I would definitely encourage people to read the fine print.

827,Rachel R,2012-12-07,4,"I like this credit card because of the rewards structure- 3% cash back for gas, 2% for groceries, and 1% for everything else. The one drawback is the 3% and 2% cash back is capped at $1500 in spending. After that you get just 1% cash back. They do have a new “Cash Back Deals” option, which usually has about 5 or so different places you can earn extra cash back. You must go in and select the deals individually though, and then you just make a purchase using the card and it will give you the bonus. They do generally have a balance transfer promotions available, but their fee is usually 4% which is higher than some cards. Another thing that makes them stand out to other cards I have is the “Portfolio” option. You can enter all your other credit cards or banking accounts and it will keep track of when those bills are do and also calculate your net worth.

They also forgot to cancel the card and then tried to stick me with the charges incurred even though they were in another state. They are easy to work with when you are setting up an account but if you use them, ensure that you educate yourself about the available products because they do not tend to inform you.

I had got some direct deposit information from them regarding direct deposit months earlier but opted out when my account was accidentally overdrawn. Then when they finally settled this dispute it’s been 7 months and I still have not received my settlement payment. Their additional charges are ridiculous and the staff is often uniformed about the simplest banking options. It won’t be long before I close my account.,Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,12,7,830,1,4

I will be closing my 3 accounts and 1 credit card account due to the continued number of fees and lack of customer friendly policies.I recently deposited a check to cover my mortgage payment and some other bills. I did a mobile deposit and the system said that the deposit was successful and would cover any transactions that processed on that day.The next morning the status changed to a ""hold"" on the check and 2 of my payments were returned unpaid. BOA also charged me $70 in fees for the 2 payments because they held the check. (Again, I have been a customer for 20 years and have never deposited a check that was returned.) In addition, since 2 of my transaction were returned, I sustained an additional $140 in late fees from my mortgage company and other merchant for the returned items.My recommendation is that you bank local where I have found that you are more than just an account #.

In their initial letter they said that my 800+ FICO score put me in the top 1% of applicants. They later withdrew the approval because they ""couldn't verify my phone number"". This is a cell phone I've had for approximately 20 years, one that I've used in every bank financial transaction/loan I've ever entered into. BOA should be given credit for responding to the two rounds of letters I wrote to bank representatives, but they gave me no believable reason why a person would be refused such a small loan because of a phone number. It should also be noted that I had a BOA Mastercard from 1994-2014 with a perfect payment record so they knew that I had a flawless credit history.

With the current rate at 10.24%, it probably isn't the lowest rate out there, but it is nice to have my credit card with the same bank as my other accounts (checking, savings, etc). The best thing is Bank of America's fraud protection on this card. Last year, their fraud protection office called and asked me if I had made a $200 purchase to ""Blizzard Entertainment"" (they run the World of Warcraft game).

I did not have a problem with my account being linked until I realized that my father had access to see everything that I purchased. However, I was forced to agree with this in order to open the account. I also tole the banker multiple times that if I did not have the funds I would like the card to be declined. However, I still got signed up for a program where the bank would take them from my savings. When I contacted customer service they told me that is what I signed up for. I know a lot of other people that have had problems with the customer service as well. This is not a bank that is looking to solve your problems.

First of all, that name does not represent America (it should be changed) because it forces people to take bad loans in efforts to profit the institution. I am stuck with a balloon second mortgage loan, which was never discussed at closing. As I am getting close to the term of the agreement, a letter was sent by the bank and the word balloon came up in big bold letters. When I called to get a clarification of what the ""balloon"" stands for; I was told that it is an interest only type of mortgage. My understanding was at the end of the term of the mortgage, I would be finished paying for the loan. This was a $69,000 loan and 13 years later, I still owe $55,000. Two more years to go to complete the term in which I taught to have a ZERO balance.Lesson learned, some banks cannot be trusted as they are greedy and will take advantages when possible. The government has now established regulations to punish banks that continue such practices.Be alert with mortgage transactions with Bank of America and those alike.

Very exciting.I waited until Dec 26th to start checking my account hoping that the companion fare was added each day. I finally contacted Alaska airlines to find out when to expect the companion fare, so I could plan accordingly for booking our trip.I was told that I would receive the companion fare after my credit card statement closing in the middle of January.This delay and issuing of the companion fare by Alaska Airlines has affected pricing for our trip and therefore the dates we will be able to take our trip and we no longer will have the ability to use, the then expired, free 1st class upgrades.We all have relationships in this world, weather with our significant others, the businesses we deal with or if we are a business, our customers.Usually if you're giving a gift for your anniversary, three weeks after your actual anniversary, things don't go very well.Each of us decides how important the relationship is and how important that anniversary is.It is apparent by their actions that Alaska Airline doesn't put too much importance on the relationship with their credit card customers and their anniversary date.I just think other consumers need to be aware of where you stand with Alaska airlines before signing up for their credit card.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,,1,6,869,1,5

The fees are inexpensive to non-existent. If you keep a minimum balance of $300 in your savings account, they waive the monthly fee.

873,j d,2014-09-25,1,"My account became a BoA account when they bought out my bank years ago, so I didn't really choose them. I would say the only thing I enjoy about this account is that BoA has many ATM locations which make withdrawals and deposits easy.However, there are still occasional issues with the fact that I opened my account in one state and now live in another. BoA keeps saying that they are trying to integrate systems which will end these issues but it never happens. It's not a big issue, the problems rarely crop up, but solving their ""integration issue"" doesn't seem to be a priority, despite what I have been told. As a premium account holder I have also tried to have legal documents notarized there once - but they insisted on charging a fee, whereas other banks do that for no cost. It just seemed a typical practice of ""fee creep"" that seems to be rampant at BoA (and other banks to be fair) since 2008. Considering their part in the mortgage scandal and recent huge government fines related to that I mostly feel I should move my money elsewhere. I get a bad vibe about their ethics.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,9,25,874,1,3

I had no need for this account, but agreed for the perks. At this time charged started racking up on my first account. This went on for several months, I tried over and over again to get a clear answer from customer service and everyone gave me a different reason.

It does what I need it to do. If I ever have a problem come up it's usually nothing that doesn't take more than a phone call to fix. Problem is that it can take between 15-20 minutes to get someone on the phone. I've had a few problems avoiding the maintenance fees. I'll never understand why I have to pay someone to hold MY money. Not to mention that BofA likes to list your withdrawals not in the order they receive them but by deducting the largest ones first thereby maximizing the overdraft fees that can occur.

Most banks already have it so that you can set up your checking account to pay this or that bill.

You will only receive the advertised bonus miles if you are approved for a fairly high credit limit that earns you ""visa signature status"". And a high credit score alone is not adequate to get to that status. They do not have a system in place that extends you a counter-offer if you are not approved for signature. You will simply receive a lesser card in the mail and you are stuck with it.

Now, yes, it did apparently bounce but I did not understand why it took so long and by the time they reversed the deposit I had written checks of my own out against it. I feel they should have contacted me much earlier because they had to know much earlier that the deposit did not go through.

I was really upset after they closed my last one and decided to call they and none of the reps knew what to tell me so they kept transferring me around. I finally spoke to a Supervisor and explained my situation and told him that I either needed a valid reason why my cards were cancelled or needed them to reopen one of my cards.

Asked if it was possible to be transferred to the original representative I was speaking to, so I did not have to restate the purpose of the accounts and the goals for each. The second representative did not know if that was possible and after 40 mins waiting (I could have set up the accounts by this time), he finally reached out to a supervisor to ask if he had the ability to transfer the call. He told me the supervisor had no desire to look into this and didn't even want to speak with me. As a new, potential customer, this was eye-opening to me that I wasn't worth their time. Ultimately, I was transfer to ANOTHER person in their sales department to set up these accounts.

It keeps records of the images of every check I wrote, so I can check the content of those checks for which I forgot who and why I wrote to.(3) BOA online service allows me transfer money instantly to and from other BOA users, without transaction fee.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,6,11,918,1,0

So far it has been a great credit card to use. I pay off the credit that I have accumulated every month and that method is very seamless. I have the bank of america app for my smartphone that allows me to transfer money from my bank account to pay for my credit card and this makes it so much easier to deal with. I can check how much credit I have used very easily and fast with the app so that I can stay on top of things. The customer service for my credit card is top notch. For instance, one time someone had gotten my credit card information which was my fault, and started making purchases with the card. Bank of America noticed the unusual amount of purchases being made with the card and called me immediately to tell me about them. With my permission, they then canceled that card so it could no longer be of uses and returned all of the sales that was being made without my permission.

I like that they initially offer 3 points for a time before they drop to the typical 1 point. Who wouldn't want money back for spending 500 dollars and I haven't seen the rewards offered, but I hope they are pretty good.

Not only is the credit limit on it substantially higher than all of my other credit cards, but I was able to secure an extremely low group-based rates that blows all other cards' rates out of the water. The customer service to date has been excellent, and, as long as you are a responsible card owner and pay the majority of your bills on time, they are very forgiving when you miss the occasional due date. The rewards program is also very good, and I have redeemed my points several times for gift cards from a number of different popular retailers (e.g., J Crew, Nordstrom, etc).",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,9,2,933,1,0

Even if you're on a strict budget, you can still earn cash back this way. Also, starting out with $100 cash back is pretty great. Having a 0% intro rate for a full year is almost unheard of in the credit card world. Overall, the perks for this card are fantastic.Compared to the REI Visa, this seems to be comparable, unless you buy a ton from REI. The nice thing about the BankAmericard is that you can get higher than 2-3% back on groceries and gas, whereas the REI Visa only offers 1% back on these types of purchases.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,8,30,934,1,4

Beyond that, it's 1 point for all other purchases, which is pretty standard - my Amazon rewards card does the same thing. The rate seems a tad lower than its competitors, though there's not much else going for the card in terms of lower rates of things like transfers, if you use that sort of thing.

They alerted me (through phone call) almost instantly that there were fraudulent charges. They went ahead and cancelled the card and sent a new one out. All the fraudulent charges were taken care of by then and it was very minimal effort on my side. As far as rewards goes, there are better ones available but I'm perfectly fine with these.

My old first progress platinum card sucked compared to this. It had much higher rates, a yearly fee, and it didn't have an intro rate like this. On this card you don't have an intro rate on the first 12 months, which is crazy good. The biggest difference is the overdraft protection.

The card requires pretty good credit and you would think that for how hard it is to get approved, it would be better, but nope.

There were two occasions, where the bank overdrew my account, and I was forced to pay a $30 overdraft fee, for a mistake the bank made. The second time the bank made a mistake, they charged me twice for one purchase I made effectively overdrawing my account again, and they tried to get me to pay an overdraft fee yet again.

The online interface is not best in class but professional and robust like you would expect from a large bank. Automatic bill pay was also a breeze to use.

They have my home mortgage, and so it is super simple to pay my monthly payment; as easy as an online account transfer. As easy as online bill-pay is with most banks now – that is probably an illogical reason to stick with a bank that you're not totally satisfied with, but there is a certain peace of mind that comes with not having to worry whether the money made it there or not.We did have some fraud issues a while back and they were very helpful and quickly resolved the issues and refunded all the money after we had filed the appropriate paperwork.I guess my big beef is just their fee structure.

This has occasionally caused problems and required me to call the customer service team to sort it out so I would urge you to pay attention to the deadlines for processing times.The only problem I have is it seems to be overly sensitive to credit card fraud.

But it is even better to buy groceries with—I offer to do all the grocery shopping for my apartment because of the two percent cash back.

Not only that but I do not have to pay any monthly bills to keep the account either; I just have to turn on paperless statements. I prefer checking it online rather than getting physical mail anyways. I was able to get a debit card with any picture or background of my choice and a free check book! The ATM machines are plentiful around the city and they have yet to fail me. That’s also very convenient. I never have to go to a bank teller, the machines are always available. Another feature I like is the fact that BoA will email or text me when my account balance drops below $25.00. That is very useful in keeping track of my bills and balance. The Cash Back Reward system is also great, for each transaction, BoA will deduct some of it into your savings as free change.I am very satisfied with being a BoA customer.

This actually did come in handy once, when a store clerk double rang my card and caused me to go into the red in my checking, my savings account had enough in it to cover it. The main thing I do not like about that is how much money they charge for you being able to use your own money to do this. This was 25 dollars it cost me and I thought that was highway robbery.

Being somewhat irresponsible at times, it would be easy for me to forget to check when a bill is due, but this card has a fixed due date which is very helpful. Also, considering I know little about how to build and maintain a good credit history, the Ultimate Money Skills is a very helpful feature to give me tips on how to be a responsible credit card owner. The late fee is quite steep, but I never plan on being late in the first place.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,8,14,961,1,2

Basically you provide a security deposit and if you do well over 12 months, you get it back. The only downside is you have a $39 fee per year, but when your building your credit it really outweighs that negative speck. After a year you can get increases based on your annual report of how much you pay and use the card. Once you establish some credit with this card you can then branch out to better cards or upgrade into a rewards card or a card of your choice.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,8,12,962,1,0

963,Joshua Rowlett,2013-08-07,4,"I am now 18 and can apply for a credit card. Comparing Capital One with the San Francisco Giants cards, I think that they are equal on having no annual fee and 0% interest, for one year. The San Francisco Giants card does allow foreign transactions, but the Capital One card does not. If someone wants to travel, the Giants Card might be the way to go instead, even though there is a 3% fee.I like that Capital One gives cash back instead of points. I prefer the $ 100 bonus instead of 100,000 points. Cash is King.For the % rates, I see that the Giants card is higher than the Capital One card. I do not like being nickeled and dimed-ever. In favor of the Giants card, if one likes points, they can earn unlimited points, whereas there is a maximum of 1.5% cashback on the Capital One card. I have never used points. But say I spent 100 for the month. That means I would get back $ 1.50. I am floored. That does not seem at all worth it. But, then again, I do not know how points would outdo this incredible cashback bonus.And the choosing point for me is that you can find out online with the Giants card, but with Capital One. To me, that means customer service is better. I would have to go with the Giants.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,8,7,964,1,2

The intro rates, which are 0% for the card, are pretty good and I actually like that a lot, and both intro rates are for 10 months or so, which is a plus.

The card gives two miles per dollar spent which is an unbelievable deal for using a credit card you already planned to use. The 15,000 bonus miles with the first major purchase is also phenomenal, as that's enough for a few business trips, and every $1,000 spent results in another 2,000 miles.

970,Jessica Wilkins,2013-01-18,4,"I currently bank with Bank of America and have had them since 2005. I wouldn't keep Bank of America so long if they weren't good but I will say that I've had my fair share of issues with this bank. The first thing that bothers me is putting my check on hold. I recently went inside the bank to cash my check on a Friday. I had the check I had received from work and was told that I would have to pay $8.95 because I don't have direct deposit or I can waive the fee and cash it at the ATM. That is really stupid. I come inside the bank because I like the whole experience and they simply ruined that. Another issue is that I get paid a weekly salary plus commission. My checks vary every week and my office doesn't offer direct deposit. I had paid the $8.95 to cash my check and after she had given me a little cash back from that check and the deposit slip said hold on account. I had asked her what that was about and was told she didn't know I would have to call someone at customer service. There was a big problem with that since my rent would be coming out first thing Sat. morning. Eventually after having to be a little ugly to the customer service manager I was able to get the hold removed. I know this review sounds bad but Bank of America is a really good bank and offer a lot of great services. The only thing I would say is they should close a little bit later on Saturdays. I would recommend Bank of America to any of my friends, but beware if your pay checks are for different amounts each week.

You can simply transfer money from either type account to the credit card account and it is paid immediately. I only use this credit card once every two or three months, for big purchases such as vacations, car repairs and other unforeseen expenses. So far, this has worked out great.

I got all my direct deposits on time, I had enrolled in Keep The Change and was enjoying that, I also opened a savings account to go along with my checking account.After a year I was approved for 1000 dollar line of credit, after that is when everything went downhill. My credit card got charged for 600 dollars worth of phone cards in Mexico. They were not sure how it happened but they filed a report and said I would be reimbursed for all the fraudulent charges. I was only reimbursed $350. Then there was a teller error and when I went to deposit a check to my account it somehow was sent to someone else's account and it took 21 days for me to get my money back. My checking account also got hacked and cleared out and it took way too long for me to get my money back but even when I did they made me pay the overdraft fees that were accrued.I asked if me getting all my account numbers and card numbers changed would help and i was told over the phone that if i stopped using my stuff online I wouldn't have that problem. I found that extremely rude seeing how at the time I wasn't even comfortable with online shopping.. After all that I decided it would be best to move my money to a different institution.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,7,30,1045,1,0

I didn't make the switch because Bank of America was so terrible, but more for the easy access and free student checking provided by First Citizens. I found my new bank's staff to be much more helpful and open about the policies and fees associated with the different processes I had to go through. I don't recommend Bank of America for anyone who wants a straightforward and no hassle checking experience.

This was one of the worst experiences of my life. First of all, the customer service was awful. They were rude and a little bit disrespectful every time I was there. The next biggest thing: all the hidden fees they gave me. It was starting to get ridiculous. They charge me five dollars here or there for almost no reason at all.

The wait time was manageable, and I was soon speaking with a representative of the bank who proceeded to assist me with creating my online account. They explained things in an easy-to-understand manner, and were also able to answer any questions that I had.

1048,Michael VanDyke,2012-07-30,2,"I have used Bank of America checking for 4 years. My use of this account is as a go-between for my USAA checking account, since USAA doesn't have a physical presence in my town. So, for cash deposits I tend to use Bank of America and then funnel that money to USAA. Given my use of this account, I often have a zero-balance. Everything was fine for a few years, but then I got a statement in the mail with a balance of -$10. Turns out they had snuck a change in the terms of the account in a previous statement without my knowing. I accept responsibility for not reading all the fine print every month, but I still find it dishonest to be changing what was marketed as a ""Free Checking Account"" to one that requires a monthly ""service charge"" without making a blatant attempt to notify the consumer. This was done sneakily on purpose to make some money.Having said all that, I was able to go down to the local branch and get it straightened out, but not without pressing the issue more than I should have been required to. A less confrontational customer might not have gotten their money back. For this experience I have to downgrade my overall rating of Bank of America Checking to 2-stars.

I had one loan officer who would call me from his cell phone and that was nice not to see a bunch of strange numbers coming up from my caller ID. It also made it nice to be able to get a hold of him almost at any time to answer all of my (sometimes silly) questions. The only complaint I would have is that there are not many physical brick and mortar branches in my particular area. I had to drive 1 hour round trip a few times to physically sign something, or have something faxed. Minor things really.

The APR is pretty low, I can use it just about anywhere, and there's no smart chip so I don't have to worry about the type of identity theft so common with those type of cards now. On the downside, there's no rewards, and my credit limit is never getting extended on the card (which is the same as the deposit).

I am disappointed today when I try to redeem my 22000 points thinking I will get $220 +10% more being Preferred customer of BoA. However I came to know that the total value for 22000 points in $132. Yes, $132. Which was very shocking to me. When I spoke to customer care (Tim), He told me that the value of 1.5 point is only $1 and some extra charges for cash redemption. It is same for gift cards too. They say 4200 points for $25 gift card. This is pathetic. If anyway, I am going to get less than $1 for each $100 spent then Why are you cheating customers saying you are earning more points. Till now, BoA impression was very good for me but it is lost.

I like that I get 1.5x points for all purchases, but I do wish there were certain categories I could get more in. Since I have that for my Freedom though, it didn't bother me too much. I would recommend it only to people who travel, since there are better cash back cards out there, with similar bonuses. Oh! I like the 20,000 point bonus for spending $1000 in the first 3 months.

Thus, this is a great card for your everyday purchases since the 3% on gas and groceries really adds up and is more than you would get from other cards.

I wanted to build up my credit, and it did do the job. I was disappointed in the rewards though. Although I used the card frequently, it felt like I was barely earning anything extra. I could have gone with a secured card with no rewards and have pretty much the same experience. The interest rate also was higher for this card than some of the others I have, which is probably why it's so easy to attain.

While the card was easy to obtain, it does not have the best offers anymore. There are now cards out there that offer longer 0% interest on balance transfers or give rewards.

They allowed my service provider to continue to charge me monthly after I had put a block on them, and they overdrew my account every month, and BofA told me they couldn't do anything about it if they didn't stop charging me themselves. This went on for about 4 months, where every time my ISP would apologize and say it was the last time, but every time they lied. I tried closing my account while I figured out a new job situation, but the charges from the ISP kept reopening my account, which I think is a terrible thing after having explained my problem to the bank with the ISP.

This comes in handy when I know a check is going to bounce or any time I see my account going to a negative balance and I want to avoid receiving an overdraft fee. Of course any checking account can be kept from a negative balance if one simply maintains an accurate check register and never spends beyond the available balance shown on that register but sometimes when I am having a busy week that creates more spending on the run, my available balance seems to disappear faster than I can keep track.Any time I see my account running negative I must get to a Bank of America ATM and deposit cash before 8pm that evening. Once Bank of America clears the days transactions over night my balance must be running positive or I am going to receive at least one overdraft fee.Aside from their overdraft fees, recently I learned they have a check cashing fee for anyone who does not have an account with them. In other words if you are holding a check in your hand that is drawn on Bank of America, even if it is a payroll check, you will be charged $6 to cash that check at one of their teller windows. Since I already hold a Bank of America checking account I can cash a check written to me and drawn on them with no fee but for anyone who wants to get immediate cash for a check drawn on Bank of America and does not want to hold an account with them, they will be out the six dollars.

1085,Jess Broyer,2014-04-01,4,"I have had my account at Bank of America since I was sixteen. Back then, I was granted a free checking account. Once you reach a certain age, as they do in all banks, your account is switched to a basic account. Though the account has a fee associated with it, mine is waived monthly because of my direct deposit. That, to me, is worth sticking around. After all, few banks offer free checking nowadays, and Bank of America at least offers you a way around the fee. My only concern is: I am a working mother and might soon take some time off of work and will, in turn, have no income coming into my account. With no direct deposit, I'd hate to have to pay the fee, but I'll cross that bridge when I get there, I guess. As for other account features, I never have to deal with a teller. I never have to wait on lines. Instead, I use their advanced ATM machine for everything, and I use their online banking to check my balance constantly (I don't keep a checkbook). All in all, my experience has been a good, convenient one. And one more thing: I LOVE their Keep the Change program!

Fees are fair and whenever I have had an issue they have been resolved to more than I could have expected. For example, I had an issue once where a check that had been written and then cancelled kept being run through my account fraudulently. This caused several items to overdraft and fees to be issued. I spoke with customer service and the check was cancelled through the fraud department and all fees cleared. I also like that if you do make a mistake in your accounting, they do not charge fees if money was in the account when you used your debit, even if there is no money when the final item posts. Also, as long as you deposit money into the account before close of business if over drafted, you will not be charged a fee. My only ""complaint"" is that I am currently in an area that Bank of America is not.

1101,Brian Sayler,2012-08-15,4,"This was the first credit card I've ever owned. As a college student, I thought it would be a good idea to build some credit before I graduated and hit the real world. The rewards, while generous for the first $1500 you spend, are reduced to 1% afterwards. So you get a good positive reinforcement when you first start use card (albeit responsibly, paying off the card on time every month), but then after you end up being like ""where's the cash rewards?"" Also, applying and getting approved for more credit is so easy, it's almost scary.The only complaint I would have is that the card is not travel-friendly. I didn't realize this until I traveled abroad: it does come with a significant fee of about 3% for every international transaction you make. So if you study abroad or travel, I would recommend using a different card, because I racked up about $200 in fees.Overall, a good card for domestic use.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,8,15,1102,1,2

At times I forget and then find that I've accumulated enough points for a payout ($25 in rewards in this case), so it's a bit like finding forgotten money lying around the house. I always make sure I completely pay the card off to maintain a good credit score, and because of course interest makes it more expensive in the long run.

The 3-2-1 is definitely cool; however, just as with all credit cards make sure you pay your balance in full otherwise your cash back will be worth nothing. I'm not quite sure how other cash back cards work, but you can only cash out in increments of $25.00. That to me doesn't seem fair as they are offering a reward with a catch. It is definitely a card worth the rewards if you can pay it off each month and if you use it EXCLUSIVELY.

1107,Kristy Pruitt,2012-08-15,5,"This is by far the best credit card I've ever had. The rewards program is straightforward, and earning rewards is easy. They start you off with a $100 bonus once you've spent a total of $500 on the card. You also get 1% cash back on all purchases except for groceries and gas, for which you get 2% and 3% respectively. I try not to use credit cards for those things, but when I have a bad month and have no other options, it's nice to know that I'll at least be getting a portion of it back.The best part is all the options you have for redeeming your rewards. Most card issuers make you redeem for airline tickets, gift cards or lame prizes, but not Bank of America. They give you real, actual CASH back. Once you've accumulated a minimum of $25, you can have your rewards balance transferred to your bank account or request a check.

I wanted to wait to post my review until we had some resolution to our situation, and now that has come to pass. Initially, we bought out condo when the market was going crazy (2007). As a result, we bought much MUCH higher than we should have. Since then, life happened, and we needed to move to something bigger. We put our condo on the market in 2010 and it took nearly 2 years to sell. Now, while we had the mortgage and were living in the condo we had no problems with Bank of America. However, once we tried to sell the condo we ran in to some serious issues. Over the course of 2 years we had 2 people willing to buy our condo above the current market value, but Bank of America was unwilling to do a short sale. Unfortunately, there was no way we could make the monthly payment and there was NO way somebody would be able to pay for the entire mortgage that was left. They seemed unwilling to work with us. We went to a branch to talk to somebody, but the information wasn't passed along to the mortgage department. They were unwilling to work with us until now, and at this time we're working with a representative to complete a final short sale. It has been a long and tiring experience, but I'm sure experiences like this does not lie only with Bank of America.

My wife and I have a shared account so every charge we make with this card results in cash back for us.This card provides at least 1% back on every purchase, while also giving 2% back on groceries, and 3% back on gas. As my wife and I both commute a healthy distance for work, the 3% back on gas is great. This cash back is ours to keep -- there are no fees associated with this card that would subtract from the rewards.It works especially well if you have a Bank of America checking/savings account, as we do. This gives an extra 10% of the rewards you earn each month, as long as you have the rewards deposited automatically into your account. This is a good deal as I don't know why you wouldn't want the funds in your account anyways.As with other cash back cards, this works best if you pay off the balance in full every month.

I find this card to be perfectly handy so long as you pay it off completely every month otherwise the interest charges start kicking in and that's no fun.In conclusion, I find this credit card to be a very good one and I plan to continue using it mainly on my gas purchases as well as groceries and other things occasionally. Ultimately, the point is to use it adequately, while still being able to pay it off at the end of the month.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,8,1,1127,1,2

The late fee is a bit too high for my taste but it does serve as a great reminder to pay my bills in time. The cash back bonus also serves as somewhat of an incentive for frequent shoppers, I myself do not have many bills at this time so that feature is not very useful for me.

I was in college and actually wanted to start to build up my credit and was able to get this card. I was at first specticle about gettting a credit card thinking that somehow the payments and terms would be too much, but that's not the case with this BoA Visa. It comes in handy for the little things I need (in between paychecks) and fully serves its purpose and then some because of the cash back on things like groceries. I am also able to build credit which is great. I am still a loyal customer and I have been out of school for quite some time.

These included things like lost/stolen debit cards (I always was given a temporary card right away - had to pick it up at the nearest bank branch - and a replacement card was mailed to me in a few days) and fraudulent charges (a crooked Internet company charged me for things I hadn't purchased, and BoA quickly refunded my money after a brief investigation).

Their website makes it easy to transfer money between my own accounts and also allows me to transfer money from my account to the accounts of other Bank of America customers. For example, my husband and I have separate checking accounts and we are able to quickly and easily make online transfers between each other's accounts with no fees. The Bank of America ATMs are also great because they allow me to deposit both cash and checks into my account and if the deposit is made before 8pm the funds will be available on that same day.

It seems like the system itself is the problem, because the people at the banks and the customer service over the phone are actually really great. They definitely do their hardest to try to make sure that the customer is happy. But with Bank of America there are too many draw-backs. They will not allow me to deposit my husband’s checks from work without him being there even though we share the same last name and he endorsed it. They also charge a fee for not having direct deposit, yet they won’t accept direct deposit from his job.

It's okay, but you have to have an excellent credit score to obtain it, not to mention the late fee is a bit excessive.

Therefore, I used 50% of my credit.A week later, they reduced my limit to 9k and closed my other cc as well! a month later, I noticed they charged my ~$170 interest fees as cash advance! I called them and they told me that I shouldn't deposit those checks in my own checking account and that's why they considered that as CA.Now My credit score dropped by 85 points and it's so difficult for me to pay this costly debt quickly. Avoid any products of BofA and leave them ASA you can. I opened a checking account with them with $10k and had 25k for some times, and still they don't trust me.

On those rare occasions when I had to dispute a transaction (total of 3 times within the 25-year period), this card has always sided with the merchant, no matter how wrong, no matter how frodulant that merchant was, no matter how much supporting documentation I produced and no matter how black & white the issue was. I found dealing with their claims department to be an insulting experience because of utter stupidity of their staff, including supervisors. And so, after a quarter of a century of being a loyal member I canceled this card.

This would be useful in helping determine which card to pay off first and which card to use for future purchases. Other factors also apply of course (namely total cash back and cash back percentage).Of my 11 credit cards, I was able to find the purchase APR and cash advance APR quickly by perusing their websites (except for Amex. They made it difficult to get the percentage rates. It took me a few minutes longer. Amex had the highest purchase APR bar none! No wonder they gave me the run around).With Bank of America, the website told me to submit a request and they'll back to me via email or snail mail and stated that it might take them 3 to 5 business days to get this info to me. I was forced to navigate the labyrinth of their phone menus before finally getting a live person who gave me the rates.As it turned out, this card had the second lowest rate amongst my 11 credit cards. And they were trying to hide this from their customers? When combined with good cash back rates for gas & groceries, this makes this card number one in those categories. What a stupid, short sighted policy! Talk about shooting yourself in the foot!

1184,Patrick Poppe,2018-04-09,1,"Classic BAIT & SWITCH! WATCH OUT Here’s a HUGE info tip for all your readers/followers: Recently applied for the Alaska Airlines Signature Card for my wife online. She’d just passed the 5/24 rule and her inquiries dropped to 2, so thought it’d be a piece of cake, but … First, some info: Her credit rating is 813. We own two houses outright, and our net worth is $1 million plus. We have no debt, and have been banking with BOA for years. My wife also earns $50,000 a year, and teaches for a school district. So, you’d think all would be easy, right? Filled out the online application, and BOOM – “Congrats, you’ve been approved” - great, BUT – as I looked closer, approval was only for $1,000. Hmmm, so I started reading the fine print following the notice. Ready? It said any approval with less than a $5,000 limit WOULD NOT receive the ‘Signature’ card. Rather, they would be sending the ‘Platinum Plus’ card instead. No bonuses offered under the ‘Signature’ card would be honored. SO, classic ‘BAIT AND SWITCH’ by BOA. I’ve called to get the issue resolved, but as of yet BOA’s only answer was: We can’t disapprove without issuing a lower card …. Or something like that. Meanwhile, I’ll just need to cancel the card if I’m not satisfied. Oh, and the inquiry is now logged, and my wife’s credit was knocked slightly.

I can do without the $12 per month maintenance fee. I'm still trying to understand what it's for and why it's so much when other banks have either done away with the fee or charge way less.

But the negatives outweigh the positives for me: they charge crazy fees for overdraft if you're not protected by linking your checking to your BofA credit card (but even then, the credit card charges you a $10 ""overdraft protection fee""). They also charge foreign transaction fees which is really weird for a bank that's linked to international banks. You're treated more like a number than a customer.

I am having some qualms about them, but this is a fairly recent development.Let me describe my checking account and debit card experiences. I liked the campus checking account I had with them. It was very convenient and didn't have a minimum. I love how easy it is to find an ATM and how easy and simple it is to deposit check and cash deposits. However I have grown up and left college, so now they have started to add fees and honestly I am not sure it is worth it anymore to have a charge of $8.95 per a month just to have a checking account. I am seriously considering changing my debit card just for this. I also felt that I wasn't informed about the change in my checking accounts adequately.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,7,17,1215,1,1
1215,Brian,2012-07-17,5,"My over all experiences with Bank of America checking accounts are relatively positive. I have never once had a problem that wasn't resolved soon after. On my account type there is no minimum balance, and with being a college student, that feature itself can be a life saver. Another thing that I really enjoy about this account is the ability to make deposits from at the ATM. It is very convenient and very easy to do, it saves me a lot of time when I have to make a deposit at school and an ATM machine is located closer to me than a branch is. I would have to rate Bank of America 5 out of 5 because I haven't ran into any true problems yet and I have enjoyed saving through this company.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,7,17,1216,1,1
1216,Luther Greene,2012-07-17,4,"My experiences with Bank of America have mostly been very good. Before opening up my bank account about 5 years ago, I was basically financially illiterate. The tellers at my bank carefully explained to me everything I needed to know. It couldn't have been easier.My one complaint with Bank of America is that when I wire money overseas (my circumstances are such that this occurs on a semi-regular basis), the conversion rate is pretty bad. I take it that the rates online are better than what the banks actually end up doing.But for someone who is just looking for a good reliable bank with good customer service and a good online banking system, Bank of America is very good.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,7,17,1217,1,1
1217,Justin,2012-07-17,4,"I have a Bank of America Power Rewards card, and I am very satisfied with it overall. However, I am a very responsible individual and I pay off my balance every single month. In fact, I don't even know what my interest rate is because I've never had to pay it. The reason I like this card so much is that the rewards are 100% legitimate. When I get to 5000 points, I get $50, no problem, no hassle, nothing unpleasant. Moreover, I like that they are VERY good about fraud prevention. Twice I had fraud on my card (nothing major) and both times they very easily deleted the bad charges and with no hassle I got a new card. I would highly recommend getting a Power Rewards credit card AS LONG AS YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE. The thing is, too many people aren't responsible, and then it isn't worth it.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,7,17,1218,1,1

Problems have been few and far between. The few issues I have had have been resolved completely and the employees went above and beyond to make sure that I was satisfied with them. I started out with a checking account and throughout the years have gained car loans, a mortgage and a credit card. They have great rates and I am very satisfied with my checking account and all of their products. Bank of America locations are convenient and ATMs are everywhere.

For a massive bank, they do a good job of trying to assist each customer properly, and the tellers at my local branch are always polite and attentive. I dislike the fact that there are so many fees, even on 'free' checking accounts, and I really don't like having to pay to talk to a teller. I appreciate the online banking tools they have, and the fact that I can do almost everything through an ATM, rather than go into the branch location.My biggest issue with them is around consumer fraud issues. When my identity was stolen, they made it truly difficult to speak to the correct person. I realize this is an area that has rapidly expanded in the past few years, and I hope they are able to put some processes in place that will both streamline the handling of fraud cases internally, and make the process easier for customers.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,7,17,1220,1,1

The customer service that is online is phenomenal as well, being available at most hours of the day to assist you with making payments and seeing where your funds are allocated. You can even pay most of your bills online straight through BofA! The only problem that I can see with it, is it is somewhat difficult to navigate to where you are actually supposed to pay your credit card bill online.

For comparison, the CapitalOne Venture card offers 1.25% back on all purchases, and also has no annual fee.

The fee is cheaper than other banks, but it should not cost me $140 dollars a year to maintain a checking account. One of the best perks about Bank of America is the way I can deposit checks. I can just take a check to any Bank of America ATM and directly deposit the check into my account. I don’t need to wait in line for the teller. That is a really nice advantage. I usually only deal with tellers, if I need to deposit money into my account, and I need the money to post the same day. I love having the option of interacting with the banking staff, or doing the banking on my own terms. My account has been overdrawn a couple of times, and I’ve been able to get the fees waived, because of miscalculations on my part. I can honestly say that the staff of Bank of America, really goes the extra mile for their customers. I’ve only been with BOA for about a year and a half, but it’s been my favorite bank to have a checking account with, over all the other big banks that I’ve tried. The debit card comes with extra security, as it offers the patron the choice of having their picture on their card. I personally think that gives my debit card an extra touch of flair.

They called our home number when nobody was here and only gave 3 hour window to return the call. Customer service said send the other check and it will go through and will not be flagged. The 2nd check ended up being denied again a week later and once again they called our home # and only gave a 3 hour window to call back before denial. Fraud and customer service just kept transferring us back and forth and we had to explain the situation over and over again every time we were transferred. Finally gave up after the 4th transfer with no answers. Don't bother sending the 0% checks with the bills if you don't want people to use them. Also my wife is disabled and has severe speech issues so when she called she gave them her information and asked them to speak to me to make it easier since she is the cardholder and I cannot just call on her behalf. While most reps were ok with that the last one absolutely refused to speak to anyone other than my wife not caring that she gave her permission to allow me to speak for her while she was on the other line.

The most appealing features that this bank offered to me, at the time, were low to no monthly fees depending upon my balance, and the option to enroll in their 'Keep the Change' program.

What was even better, was that for the first year they matched the amount each month! After graduating from college, when the low monthly fees disappeared I decided to close my savings account with Bank of America.

I really do NOT like the fact that the balance requirements are so high- maintaining upwards of 10k in a checking account is kind of unreasonable.

1310,Joe Weider,2011-12-02,3,"People love personalizing their credit cards. It’s a way to set themselves apart and a reason to smile every time they open their wallets. But the mistake too many people make is sacrificing value for branding. By that I mean if you have to pay more or get less rewards for a credit card just because it has a certain picture or name that plays on your interests, don’t get that card. Unfortunately, this is the case for golfers and the PGA Tour Credit Card. This PGA branded Bank of America credit card requires above-average credit for approval and only offers 1 point for every dollar you spend in return. That’s just not competitive in today’s market, so to use golf lingo, I’d have to say that the PGA Tour Credit Card doesn’t make the cut.The obvious question is if the BofA PGA Credit card won’t be around for the weekend, what card or cards will. If you like traveling to PGA events, a good generic travel rewards card like the Venture from Capital One would be a better choice than the PGA credit card. It offers basically 2% cash back when you redeem miles for travel charges. Anyone who’s been to a PGA tournament recently also knows that having an American express credit card gets you those course vision portable tvs that allow you to see the broadcast feed and keep up with what’s going on with the rest of the field when following a certain group or staying stationed at a particular hole. If I had to pick an Amex card to get instead of the PGA Tour Credit Card, Id go with the Blue Cash Everyday Card because it offers a $100 sign-up bonus (think greens fees) and 3% cash back on purchases made at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores and 1% on everything else. So just call your interest in the PGA Tour Credit Card from Bank of America a mulligan and hit another shot.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,12,2,1311,1,4
1311,Joe Weider,2011-12-01,2,"If Jack Bauer tells you to get a credit card, you get it because you sure don’t want to see him mad. Just kidding, but you may recognize the BankAmericard Cash Rewards name from the commercials with Kiefer Sutherland where people are talking about how confusing credit card rewards can be with all the rules and restrictions and how simple their BankAmericard Cash Rewards Cards are in comparison. You have to wonder how accurate that is though. Is the card really good enough to warrant the people in the commercial saying they “love” it? Well it’s important to point out that the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit has changed since these commercials were first run. While simplicity is still the main message, the rewards available with what is now called the BankAmericard Cash Rewards™ Visa Signature® Card - New Cash Rewards and Bonus Offer have progressed from an easy-to-keep-track-of 1% cash back on all purchases to 3% cash back on gas purchases, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else. This is not the only change made to the Cash Back BankAmericard though. Where there was previously no limit to the rewards you could earn, the 3% on gas and 2% on groceries only apply to the first $1500 you spend in these categories combined. You also get a $50 initial rewards bonus.So it seems like Bank of America is doing the exact things it condemned in its previous advertising. But any problems you might have with the hypocrisy of the situation don’t make the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Visa Signature Card bad. What make it not the best option are the limits and the fact that it is a Visa Signature Card. Most people want simplicity and convenience from their cash rewards and the earning caps with this product add something to worry about. Also Visa Signature Cards have a feature called NPSL, which means you don’t have a set credit limit and that your credit utilization won’t be accurately conveyed to credit bureaus. This can make planning purchases difficult and also hurt your credit score. Anyway, if you want a 1-2-3 rewards card the Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express is better than the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card because it offers 3% cash back on groceries, 2% on gas station and department store purchases, and 1% on everything else without earning limits or other restrictions. It also has double the initial bonus offered by the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Visa. Uhoh, it looks like the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Visa Signature Credit Card is going to have to reinvent itself yet again.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,12,1,1312,1,3
1312,Joe Weider,2011-11-28,1,"I suppose “Accelerated Rewards” are those that you earn faster, but one would think that this must be relative to something and highly dependant on your spending habits. The Bank of America Accelerated Rewards Credit Card from American Express can’t have gotten its name from a comparison with other cards that offer a certain cash back rate across all purchases though because it only offers 1.25% cash back while the Capital One Cash Credit Card for example offers 1.5%. And if you spend a lot in certain expense categories, you would certainly earn rewards faster with a card that offers elevated rewards in those particular categories than with the Bank of America Accelerated Rewards American Express Card. Maybe the rewards are accelerated relative to other BofA cards or other Amex cards or maybe the card’s name is just misleading. Whatever the case may be, it’s pretty clear that there are better available options for people with excellent credit.If you want an initial rewards bonus better than the $50 you get with the Accelerated Rewards Credit Card, opt for the Chase Sapphire Preferred. It offers either $625 in travel or $500 in cash. If you want a better base cash back rate, get the previously mentioned CapOne Cash Card. If you want 0% on purchases or transfers, get the Citi Simplicity Card (21 months on both). Like the Accelerated Rewards Credit Card, none of these cards have annual fees during the first year and only the Chase Sapphire Card has one beginning in the second ($95).

1313,Joe Weider,2011-10-13,2,"What say we continue my look at college and university alumni credit cards by exploring one with a fancy name: the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma Platinum Plus® MasterCard® credit card with WorldPoints® rewards. This card, like most other alumni cards, is offered by Bank of America and requires good/excellent credit for approval. You might then be expecting some really interesting rewards considering what you can get with good or excellent credit in the traditional rewards and low interest credit card genres, in which case you may be disappointed that this card only gives you one point for each dollar you spend, which can be redeemed for the usual merchandise, travel, gift cards and charitable donations.One would think that BofA would donate a certain percentage of your spending with the OU credit card to the school, allow you to redeem points for unique OU experiences, or provide some other unique perk to explain why this card gets OU branding, but I was unable to find any on either the University of Oklahoma online credit card application or the OU website. I therefore don’t really see the point to getting the OU credit card. In doing so, you would be sacrificing a heck of a lot of rewards potential basically to have the OU logo on your card, which you can do for free if you simply personalize any Capital one credit card. By the way, from what I can tell OU Homecoming festivities will be taking place from Oct. 17 – Oct. 22, culminating with a home football game against Texas Tech.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,10,13,1314,1,3

Cal Berkley’s homecoming is this wknd (Oct. 13-16) and since the nostalgia that comes with traveling back to campus might result in many former students considering applying for the UC Berkley Credit Card, it makes sense to know what you’re getting yourself into.The Cal Alumni Association Platinum Plus® MasterCard® credit card with WorldPoints® rewards--which is issued by Bank of America, requires at least a “good” credit score for approval, and has no annual fee—offers 0% on purchases for 12 months and gives you 1 point/$1 spent, which can be redeemed for travel, merchandise, etc. Unfortunately, after examining the UC Berkley Credit card’s online application, it doesn’t appear that card use automatically results in donations being made to the Cal Alumni Association, which is strange, given that most alumni credit cards are basically charity credit cards. So, for all you Golden Bears looking to give back to the institution that educated you, I recommend getting the best possible cash back credit card because you then have the option to use your rewards for whatever you want, including charitable donations, merchandise, memorabilia, travel, etc.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,10,12,1315,1,2
1315,Joe Weider,2011-10-06,4,"In honor of what the Detroit Tigers will be doing after tonight’s critical Game 5, I’ve decided to take a look at what the Bass Pro Shops Credit Card has to offer (get it, they’ll be fishing because their season’ll be over!). For starters, the Bas Pro Shops credit card is for people with at least good credit and does not have an annual fee, pretty much par for the course for rewards credit cards. Speaking of rewards, it offers 4 points per dollar spent on any purchase of Bass Pro Shop-branded merchandise, 2 points/$1 on purchases made at Bass Pro Shop stores or via the popular fishing and outdoor supply store’s website or catalog, and 1 point for everything else. You also get a $100 gas card, good at any gas station chain, after spending 200 bucks in the first 90 of being a cardholder. This Bas Pro card even offers 0% on purchases for 12 months.That all sounds great on the surface, but the real question should be how this card stacks up against the best rewards cards for good or excellent credit, especially since the rewards you earn with them can be redeemed for a number of things, including cash, travel, dining and merchandise, not ONLY Bass Pro Shop Gift Certificates, as is the case with this card. Well, every 500 points you earn with the Bass Pro Credit Card can be redeemed for $10 in Bass Pro Gift Certificates. Correct me if I’m wrong, but that would seem to make it at worst essentially a Bass-Pro-centric 2% cash back credit card with a decent initial bonus. Not too bad, and while I think I’d still take Capital One’s Cash Credit Card, which offers 1.5% cash back across all purchases, so as not to push myself into a corner as far as rewards redemption, it should work well for any of the Tigers or any Bass Pro fanatics out there.

1316,Joe Weider,2011-10-03,4,"It occurred to me just the other day that air travel and a credit card that rewards you for such aren’t necessarily the only ways to get to a Yankees playoff game this fall and lower the cost of doing so. There are, of course, other modes of transportation, so I decided to take a look at the Amtrak Credit Card to see what kind of perks it offers. First of all, this card requires at least good credit, so if you don’t have a good or excellent credit score, don’t bother applying for the Amtrak Card or reading further. If you do, the Amtrak credit card doesn’t have an annual fee and offers a base rewards earning rate of one point per dollar spent, 2 points per dollar spent on Amtrak purchases, 5% of your points back every time you redeem and, perhaps most importantly for saving in the short term, 18,000 bonus points after you make your first purchase. Seeing as you can get a regular coach fare class ticket for 3,000 points, a business class fare for 8,000 points and your own bedroom on an overnight train for 20,000 points, that seems like a pretty good deal. So, if you want to take advantage of this card’s attractive initial bonus or you frequently travel with Amtrak and want to effectively lower the cost of this expense, why not add the Amtrak Card to your rewards credit card collection? I would not make this card your main rewards credit card though because you can find a cash back credit card like the Capital One Cash Card that will be both less hassle and more lucrative, given the 1.5% cash back it provides across all purchases.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,10,3,1317,1,0
1317,Joe Weider,2011-09-28,5,"So, in the latest installment of my little credit card review series (it’s turning into a series, but really I just research and write about credit cards when I’m bored because I’m weird and find it interesting) I touched on the fact that you can find a rewards credit card related to basically any niche interest you may have—even your favorite sports team. And with the Yankees having recently clinched the AL East as well as home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, which are set to begin in just a few days, I thought, “Why don’t I see what credit card companies are doing to reward the greatest baseball fans on the planet?”.Unfortunately, the answer is that we don’t get bonus rewards just for being Yankees fans. Bank of America does offer this Major League Baseball credit card, which you can personalize with your favorite team’s logo, but the basic rewards earning rate (1 point/$1 spent), bonus rewards (10,000 bonus points after at least $250 in purchases post to your account within 90 of becoming a cardholder), and special perks (20% off on MLB shop purchases and the ability to redeem points for merchandise and memorabilia) are the same regardless of whether you root for Jeter and the boys or the lowly Baltimore Orioles. And that, my friends, just doesn’t seem right. This isn’t Little League anymore. There are winners and losers in professional sports, and the Yankees and their fans are the biggest winners of all, so I say that we deserve AT LEAST 2% cash back. I, of course, say this with my tongue planted firmly in my cheek, but go Yanks nonetheless!

1319,Joe Weider,2011-09-27,5,"Ok, so I’ve been interested in credit cards for a long time, particularly those that offer rewards, because I think it’s interesting that you can save or get free stuff just by making a purchase with one piece of plastic as opposed to another. I’ve just recently started exploring this interest in depth though, and the sheer extent of the rewards credit card market and the seemingly countless different types of cards targeted to niche interests and tied to various companies has amazed me. I mean if you want a card tied to your school’s alumni association, it’s there. If you want one that shows your support for a sports team (Go Yanks and Giants!), take your pick. You can even get a card that gives auto insurance rewards.Take this AAA Cash Rewards Credit Card, for example. It gives you 2% cash back on AAA travel purchases, purchases made at AAA retailers and AAA Mid-Atlantic Insurance Group premiums as well as 1% on everything else and doesn’t have an annual membership fee. While I wouldn’t recommend using this card as your main rewards credit card given that a card like the Capital One Cash Card offers 1.5% on all purchases and it certainly doesn’t meet my particular needs, it could make a good addition to your rewards card collection if you have AAA insurance and spend a couple grand on AAA-related purchases per annum. After all, I really see the value in having a few different rewards credit cards tied to specific interests.

They do a fine job, I find of helping tailor their service to the individual customer's needs.

Except that I don't really want to find a new bank I have no reason to stay with Bank of America. Their locations are convenient but their customer service leaves a lot to be desired. They're a huge banking institution and nickle and dime their small customers. ATM card not working? $5.00. No free checks. Nothing for loyal customers, no exceptions.

1384,Freda Brown,2015-03-09,5,"I have had serious problems with overdraft charges in the past. Before the Obama administration changed the rules, I had several situations where an unexpected charge would come in and cause a cascade of overdraft charges. For example, I recall having a Starbucks charge for 2 dollars and something else came in and created an overdraft of less than a dollar. All the other postings for that day then were also overdrafts . And each overdraft created a fee of 35 dollars! I am on a limited retirement income, so these occasions were total disasters. I've forgotten now how the rules have changed, but since they did, I have not had this situation arise again.

I also get the monthly maintenance fee waived by linking it with my checking accounts. For this I am happy. I also am enrolled in a ""keep the change"" program"", which rounds each of my transactions in my checking account up to a whole number, and transfers the ""loose change"" into my savings account. This helps me inadvertently save money. Although it seems small, I invest a good amount into my savings via the program. I have never been charged a fee in my savings account, and have actually gotten some money back from BOA since they matched some of my Keep the Change money back when I opened the account.

One I use for my bills (i.e rent, utilities, car payments, phone, etc.), the other I use for general spending. I have not really come across any problems except for the monthly maintenance fee. I think that $12 is too much for a month. Since I get direct deposit in one of the accounts, the fee is waived, but the other account gets it each month! That is $144 a month which I think is a little high.My Debit card that is linked to my account has also been flagged for ""fraud or suspicious activity"" and been cancelled a few times.

They also have excellent phone support for bank services. They have ATMs everywhere and they are easy to access and use. I rated their customer service a little low because anytime I have actually been in a branch, there is always a line and it seems like no one is there to assist you unless you are setting up a new account or service. Bank of America does, however, have the most useable online services, in my opinion. For example, if you have an additional service (car loan/mortgage) with them, it is super easy to transfer money to the note, instead of mailing! We did have a fraudulent charge on our account, and Bank of America sent an e-mail within minutes of the occurrence and had our funds back in 24 hours.

In this process BofA informed me that they no longer offered my savings account. In order to maintain my account, I had to open another credit card account and a checking account. Now with 3 accounts (when I only wanted one) I found out their checking order of operations is a little strange. BofA would deposit checks and debits not in date order but in largest to smallest order. So if I wrote 3 checks for $20 and debited $100 and then wrote another check for $200. They would debit my account, $200, $100, $20, $20, $20. They did this to try and rack up overdraft fees. Next came the fees, I never changed my account but started getting $7-$24 monthly fees for having an account.

Their service is fast and reliable and I have never had any transaction issues with my accounts. I had my wallet stolen once and didn't realize it until about 12 hours later.

The thing that I don't really appreciate about the bank is that they have a lot of fees to pay. You can obviously avoid them by completing certain things each month like make 5 transactions a month or have at least $150 in your checkings account. But besides that they have decent service. My checks normally go through rather quickly (3-4 business days) and I like having all of their ATM machines don't need envelops to deposit money. I currently use eBanking with them which is really convenient because I can do everything through the ATM without ever going to a teller.

I was impressed to hear of the efficiency of their fraud detection system, that in case of a transaction that seems problematic the bank will contact the account holder and put a hold on the account.

And furthermore, the 3% back on gas is great. Having to drive 20 miles everyday, I've been fairly content with BoA's rewards. Also, because of the massive amounts of purchasing I do online, I'm exhilarated at the fact that I get 1% back with every purchase for this card.

1400,Tally Browning,2015-05-29,3,I've used Bank of America exclusively for a number of years. What I like about it is how available its locations and ATMs are. Even in remote areas you can still access a bank/ATM. They have e-banking and paper bills as well which is convenient and good for tax/accounting purposes. The overdraft system is pretty good. They charge you every time you go over but they do allow quite a few purchases over the limit you have. I recommend overdraft protection if you're the kind of person who aimlessly card slides. What I don't like is that the interest you earn is pretty negligible. You might as well not even be earning any for the low conversion rate. It also has a ton of fees which almost come off as them scraping the bottom of the barrel any way they can to get funds out of customers.

BOA chooses to process debits, then credits to each account, in that order. Meaning, if you deposit money to cover a charge when your balance is close to 0 (to post on the same day as the debit), you will definitely get charged an over limit fee, because they charge the debit, you go below 0, then they apply the credit to your account, then they take out their fee.I have talked to a couple of CSRs about this issue and no one is helpful.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,5,20,1408,1,2

1413,Mitesh Shah,2019-11-29,1,"Bank of America's customer service and feature set have been absolutely appalling over the 8+ years that I have been with the bank. They have constantly changed account standings, settings, and issue fees even though my account was well above the threshold for these. This required me to have a monthly call with BoA to get them to refund the fees and each time I was told that it would not happen in the future but that it is the ""systems call"" whether or not changes and fees are issued; in other words, you will be charged a fee regardless of whether or not your account meets the minimum requirements for the fees to be waived. It seems that the ""system"" does this simply to be an inconvenience to you - each time I called the BoA customer service I have had to wait 15+ minutes on the phone and the callback feature does not work often either.I also have a Small Business Account with BoA; again, it more than meets the minimum requirements for all fees to be waived, yet each month I am charged a fee which I have to call to get reimbursed. I have made in-person meetings at my local branch, and while the agents have been very helpful, it seems that they don't entirely know how the BoA system works. This is surprising as they were unable to answer some of my basic questions, including why the system charges fees when the account is above the threshold.Overall, after 8+ years I have had enough of poor customer service where each agent says something different and seemingly no one understands how the system works and I have had enough of a broken system that charges its users fees regardless of whether or not they meet the threshold for the fees to be waived. Since I will be leaving BoA, I will be pulling my Small Business Account and have also had my partners and employees switch to the other bank where our Small Business Account moved to.

1426,Bela Kalinova,2013-10-21,3,"I have a BankAmerica Cash Rewards card and I can not think of very many things that stand out about this card. Everything is pretty average. There is a twelve month intro period with a good intro rate of zero percent, but that is a common offer these days. After that 12 month period it can from 12 to 24 percent. I do however enjoy the cash back program they have with this card. If you spend 500 bucks in 90 days, you will get 100 dollars cash back . That was something I really liked. There are little things like the foreign transaction fee that I do not like. Little things like that can add up.

There are so many rewards programs and benefits for using this card, that it's hard to see why anyone wouldn't! for instance, for every dollar you spend on gas or food or even at a drug store, you earn 2 points on their rewards system. I think that is awesome. You can also earn 1 point on your purchases elsewhere. So basically, wherever you use this card, you will be earning points that count on their rewards system! The downside is that their rates are rather high. The cash advance rate is somewhere in the mid twenties. I find this a very bad rate and extremely unattractive for consumers like me. Overall, good card!",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,10,21,1428,1,0
1428,Aaron Bateman,2013-10-18,5,"I have had nothing but good experiences with my BoA Travel Rewards card. It was switched over from another card I had with them that they discontinued. Although this card is labeled a ""travel rewards"" card, the points earned can also be used to receive gift cards or statement credit, much like a ""cash rewards"" card. I do admit that the exchange rate is not as good as a standard ""cash rewards"" card when using it for those transactions though. The main reason for 5 stars with me is that Bank of America's customer service has been excellent. Twice, after calling, I got them to lower my interest rate just by asking. First down to 14.9% variable and then down to 10.9% variable! This makes it my lowest interest card and warrants the 5 Star review for me.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,10,18,1429,1,4

I have also added some low return CD's through Bank of America and they have suited my needs very nicely.

Anytime you use your card it'll round off the purchase amount to the nearest dollar and adds the change to your savings account. The best part is for the first 3 months they will double what ever Keep The Change transactions you make up to a certain limit.

Fortunately, we haven't had to charge to this card much but it's been there if we needed it. Additionally, they have some awesome customer service so don’t be afraid to call.

I love that I get Keep The Change money put in there with each transaction. That money accrues quickly and I love that extra source of cash flow. There is one thing to look out for though that I just recently found out about. There is a certain type of savings account that charges you $12 monthly for having a balance lower than $1000. I cannot imagine how many times I was charged this fee, unaware that this stipulation was on my savings account (yes I now pay closer attention to my banking than I have in the past). When I brought up the charges with Bank of America they changed my account to the regular one. I don't know why that account stipulation even exists on a checking account??

The customer service is always polite and helpful. But that's as far as the positives go, unfortunately. The massive amount of hidden fees pile on. They are so quick to tack on transfer fees and the fact that they call it a fee ""for doing the transfer work for you"" is beyond obnoxious considering it takes about two keystrokes to transfer money from one account to the other.

One thing that is really annoying is that they seem to keep an eye on your balance, and if it falls low, they will wait until it is CERTAIN that a new charge will put you in the red so that you have to pay them overdraft fees. It's frustrating because unless I take a screenshot of my account every single day, I am not able to prove that they do this. By the time I get the notification that I'm being charged an overdraft fee, my account statement no longer looks the way it did before, it pushes everything up so that my balance gets dramatically smaller and then goes in the red. I'm thankful for this bank for the way they've handled my debit card info being stolen, but I feel like I've racked up what they saved me just by paying them overdraft fees later.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,12,16,1436,1,1

The only bad experience I had with BOA, which ultimately led to closing my account, was how long it took for them to correct their mistake on a check I had deposited that I needed to pay my rent.

Only issue I've ever had was a fishy e-mail that told me my account was wiped, but Bank of America confirmed it was just a glitch (they didn't go out of their way to correct the issue with me, I had to physically call them). There's also quite a bit of pressure to open up an account with Merrill Lynch to do some investing with them, but it's not overly aggressive (just a bit persistent).",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,11,17,1441,1,6

When buying $100 worth of groceries, you get $2 back. If buying $100 worth of gas, thats $3 back in your wallet. That might not seem like much, but after spending $1500 a month in gas, groceries, and other monthly expenses, this card can potentially put $45 a month back in your wallet.

My checking account didn't even have checks to begin with but the credit card agent in question ""created"" a check to pay a credit card account for someone else. Once I figured out what was going on I immediately notified my branch and the associates were amazing even helping me to find the necessary information so that I could file a police report for check fraud. Not so amazing was the fact that Bank of America's credit card division realized this blatant act of check fraud and refused to talk to me regarding the issue.

Anytime I have had a problem with my account, they explain it in depth and help me fix it in a timely manner. I also enjoy how simple it is to use their mobile application. I use it almost every day to check balances, deposit checks, and many other things. Their ""Keep the Change"" program is awesome. It is a great way to help me save my money. I really love it because I barely notice the money going out of the checking and before I know it, I have a significant amount in my savings. It’s pretty great!

Just a few clicks and done. Besides, the 1% cash back on everything is great. The most important thing is that there is a cash back program in this card and you can access them online. I mean that after you login in your account, you will see the shops with extra cash back if you use this card shopping. For example, the body shop, 10% cash back. You can find a lot shops.

In fact, when my debit card was stolen, the customer service representative went out of his way to help me cancel the card, and helped me learn how to write a check so that I still had access to my account while I waited for a new debit card to be sent.

When I called to set up out automatic payments, the agent on the other line was very nice and knowledgeable. The agent assured me that they would draft the payments on the day I set up and if it was different to just call them. The process to set up automatic payments was not hard but a little time consuming.

It’s a separate program that gives you up to 20% back when you go through their website to purchase from participating online retailers. I usually average between 5% - 10% back, which is in addition to the BoA credit card rewards!I make sure to pay it off when I get paid, so that I stay within budget and still get all the financials perks.

One charge was for $57.55 from MenuStar, a company that doesn't even service my area, and the other was from DoorDash for a restaurant named Buona, where I've never eaten in my life, for $36.12. I called the company within a couple of days, and by June 9th, there was a credit on my account for these two charges and a fraud investigation had been started. My card was canceled and a new card was sent out to me. On July 8th, 2020 the credits were reversed. The company sent me a letter telling me that the orders from these services came from my device and that they match my previous account activity. I reached out to DoorDash who confirmed this was fraud, and they refunded me $36.12. I also contacted MenuStar who confirmed that the transaction was fraud, but all they need is for BOA to reach out to them notifying them that a fraud claim was submitted. The bank doesn't want to contact the vendor for some reason, and therefore I'm stuck with the amount of $57.55. I am still in possession of the card that was used, so I was not negligent in any way. Somehow these criminals got a hold of my card, and I don't want to finance their food or lifestyle. Bank of America needs to make this right. They have a $0 liability guarantee which should be applied in this scenario. I get an e-mail from Vernon White who never answers his phone or returns my calls to confirm my complaint with the CFPB. This avoidance is totally unethical and a way for BOA to work around the CFPB. At this point this is impacting my credit score, and it's not okay.

The interest rate is 0 for the first year, and then is about 11-22% for the years afterwards. I know it's a bit high, but it's worth it and a good rate in comparison to some other cards.

They offered me a secured to help me build my credit and offered me a $99 deposit for a $500 credit line. I took it, you want to know why? Most people with bad credit and who have a second chance don’t learn their lessons and these comments show that. I don’t need the card because my credit score is above 750 but B of A doesn’t know I applied for other cards and got approved for 6 cards with a total credit limits of $50,000. Those cards will be used for 0% APR balance transfers and the $500 secured B of A card will be used for everyday things like groceries, gas, etc. and paid off every month, some of you don’t get that if you use $350 of a $500 credit limit and pay it off every month, your credit score will not drop, it only drops if you leave that balance on there and make payments, that’s how it destroys your credit. Won’t matter to me as I know to keep my utilization below 30% for balance transfers and pay a card that used monthly in full, use your head ladies and gentlemen. ****UPDATE*** I decided to apply for a credit line increase on 12/26/2019 after 5 months of having the card and the customer service rep told me I could apply anytime for a credit line increase but would take about 9 months to 12 months to see if I could apply to turn the card into a unsecure card, well she put me on hold and did her thing and came back and told me that it forced her to apply for unsecure card when checking for a credit line increase and I was approved. I got my $99 deposit back within 24hrs and my credit line was increased to $1500 and is now unsecured all within 5 months. I will now start the process of building the credit line on my card and I have to say this has been a very good card for me.

It took 4 hours to find a vacant motel room during the Senior Olympics and I used the credit card. I called after making my reservations to make sure they were good...no problem. My room was being held. My flight was delayed and I called again to let them know I was running late for checking in...only to be told I was cancelled because my credit card didn't go through! I had already placed $1300+/- on it and had a $5000 limit. Called the contact number which I obtained from the Alaska Airline Customer Service at SeaTac. Got tons of excuses. BofA wanted to confirm the transaction. Temp info is ""not valid"". The temp info was provided by Alaska Airlines and not BofA. You have the wrong expiration date. I was told the physical card takes 4-6 days. Yet the paperwork says 7-10 BUSINESS days. Nothing states how long the temp card is good for while waiting for the physical card. So, here I am, now with no housing in a sold location due to Olympics. They tell me they can ""expediate"" a card to me....but I have no where to expediate it to since I no longer have housing. I spent the next 6 hours trying to find some plus had to travel an extra 15 miles and much more to stay with a kind lady....arriving at 6am...just a few hours before we needed to meet the children we are adopting. Needless to say, we were exhausted. While looking for housing, other customers were more helpful... getting online to help me. The last thing three kids were are trying to adopt needed was another disappointment in their lives. Thanks to the kind lady that provided housing, we didn't have to disappoint them. But, Alaska Airlines or BofA, there is NO excuse for this. I'm not sure whose fault it is. BofA is blaming Alaska. Never once did I get a text, an email, or any other warning or notice that the card was, in effect, canceled. I asked that they pay the difference between motel costs....the next cheapest was over $180/nite. They refused, stating they don't do any compensation.

So I kept this card sleep for a while, but recently BOA gave me an offer to receive 5% cash back for purchase of everything, which is great, so I switched back to this card. The few things I like about this card: (1) BOA provides generous credit line to me. For a couple of times I called BOA and asked for credit line increase, and got approved. (2) With a high credit line, this card frequently provides 12-month 0% APR for balance transfer, which can be very helpful when I need money for a high yield investment. (3) Each purchase made with this card will immediately show up in my BOA online account, with good details. Based on my observations, the service is better than Chase or American Express cards. I only thing that makes me not to use this card is its cash back rate is 1% for everything purchase, which is slightly lower than some other cards, like Chase Sapphire preferred card.

If you have cashed a check, the issuer can reclaim the check as if it were a fraud and file a claim. The issuer can file a claim up until two years is what I was told by the BofA agent. Meaning issuer can re-cash the already cleared check anytime in the next two years. BofA's claims department has the leverage of debiting that amount from your checking account without notifying you or at least they say they tired to reach you, which is false. My account has an email id, and they could have notified me via email. The bank has authorized the claims and XXX $ was debited from my checking account. Which ideally means, our accounts are an open book. I fought real hard, and all they have to say is I have to contact the issuer, and they will not help me.

We would pay a 5 dollar safe checking fee on my account not my husbands to never have to worry about overdrafts and they would still do overdrafts. We called on multiple days, sat with several physical Tellers, managers, and supervisors, and even made them get on a three way merge call with my grandmother's bank for the current check having issues through them which is one of those checks you have to buy with money and is considered cash. It is very dissatisfying that our honeymoon was cut short due to the bank being unjust and not resolving or being able to verify over the phone when they had all these simple solutions they should have been able to do without their clunky software and locks. We did talk to several other banks who said that they can do that since each bank has its own policies but most banks would have had the money resolved since its been technically 4 days now. Due to all these issues we decided to pull our money and go to an alternative bank. Our families are doing the same which means they lost way more money then they anticipated.On a positive note the application process is not bad and I didn't have much issues when i got my gender change with them changing the info and changing account types. They do try to keep you safe and lock accounts for activity that feels different from what they usually see but its all mostly automated. Sucks when you need to wait an hour for it to unlock again due to the fact that it autolocked from buying from a different store, site, or in a different state than it is usually active. Other than that and easy access to an overly placed atm everywhere from being such a huge company It really feels not worth it.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,7,24,1553,1,1

Let's discuss the initial problems and then we can get to the new ones. First, branches are closing everywhere and the low amount of locations gets lower and lower everyday. Before these branches started dropping off the map, the line at Bank of America was out the door every time I went. Now, it's like your waiting on a ride at the amusement park. The customer service has suffered big time. I just called and waited over an hour to talk to a rep. Next, they are open till 5pm ONLY with a mandatory 1 hr wait. So if you work 9 to 5, you get just 2 hours on Saturday to do your banking. Yes, you guessed it. The wait is just as bad on Saturday. Clearly the worst hours of any of the financial institutions. Now they have the fewest and farthest between when it comes to amount of locations. They clearly are taking advantage of customers and closing locations to recoup losses. The problem today was: they hit me wth 8 overdraft fees for declining a transaction 8 times. My account is negative a lesser amount than the 8 overdraft fees added up! After waiting an hour and speaking to a supervisor, they said they could only refund 1 of the fees.

1562,p sellers,2014-11-07,3,Bank of America's checking account is a pretty good banking option. You can make deposits from a cell phone or at ATM machine. The only issues I have is that the branch managers don't have much authority if you have a problem that needs resolution. I also don’t like how banks are so open in that when discussing your personal information everyone can hear. Additionally having to enter a long account number on their automated system for my balance is pretty inconvenient.,Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,,11,7,1563,1,4

As for the actual account, it does everything I need it to do. Money goes in, money goes out. It does a brilliant job of that. If your local branch has some competent people at it it would be a fine account. But keep looking if your branch doesn't have decent people/service at it.

I figured everything was fine and I went on my own way. About 3 weeks after we paid off our loan, we were hit with a substantial charge from Bank of America out of our account. Bank of America was still taking out our car payment out of our account automatically even after we had paid off our loan.I contacted BoA's customer support and they were everything but helpful. They told me that I would have to log into my account to make these changes so that they wouldn't keep charging me. When I told them that I can't login because I don't have an 'active' account they told me that I needed to log in anyway.I ended up having to dispute the charge with my local bank (which costs me $30). The charge that BoA charged us fraudulently caused us to go into overdraft at our bank which was a big headache. I had to have our local bank actually put a block on the payments since Bank of America couldn't help with the removal of that charge.This is the only issue that we had with Bank of America.

However when I got my bill I was surprised to see they charged interest on the charge for the auto insurance even though I paid it off when I got the statement. I called customer service to see why and she told me that because I made a purchase it calculate interest from the date of purchase. That means if you have a promotional rate DON'T USE YOUR CARD or you will be whacked with a finance charge!!!! This card is being filed away and won't be used again until next year.

Went to another store and the same thing happened. I contacted B of A and was told that the card was declined because the amount was inconsistent with my previous purchase patterns. What??? I had only used the card for about 2 weeks at that point. Are my purchasing patterns established in a two week time frame? I asked for the restrictions to be removed and was told it was impossible.

1616,Victoria Morris,2014-08-15,3,"I've had this account for over ten years; it was the first account I had. This is Bank of America's basic checking product, and I wouldn't really recommend it except that Bank of America is everywhere and has some nice features: $10 ATM machines, instant deposit of checks from the store-branch ATMs, 100 instant credit to your account from the deposit.The downsides: it is basically nearly impossible to avoid the monthly $12 fee. This account also used to be notorious for obscene overage charges, but changes to banking law since 2010 have made this account less obnoxious - in that you can turn the overdraft ""feature"" off now so your debit card will bounce if you can't cover the cost. Prior to this, every overage would be charged $35, even if you say, went over by .5 cents.Also, the cost to refill your paper checkbook is astoundingly $35. For paper checks!The meh: Bank of America is heinously zealous about protecting you from identity theft. Which is great - unless you travel a lot. On multiple occasions I have informed BoA of my travel plans only to have them shut down my account once I'm on the trip. Doesn't matter where you go - it happened once in Denver and once in Paris. Which, since this is my primary checking account, is no good at all, especially because getting your account reactivated requires calling a stateside 1-800 number between 9-5pm Eastern time.

1620,Joe Weider,2012-03-06,2,"There’s no question that the ASPCA is a great cause. In case you didn’t know, ASPCA stands for The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and as a big time animal lover (especially dogs!), I’m all for giving them as much dough as possible. But is the ASPCA Credit Card the right tool with which to do so. In other words, how do the ASPCA Credit Card’s rewards compare to other credit cards that require good or excellent credit for approval. While charity credit cards automatically send donations to their affiliated organization, most credit cards give you the option of donating rewards earnings and even if they don’t, you can simply donate the cash gleaned from a credit card rewards program yourself. Your goal, after all, is providing the ASPCA with the most money possible. So, starting with rewards, the ASPCA Rewards Card offers 3% cash back on gas and 2% cash back on groceries up to $1,500 spent in these categories quarterly as well as 1% on everything else. You also get a 10% cash back bonus when you redeem rewards earnings into a Bank of America bank account. Unfortunately, though, the ASPCA Card does not appear to have anything to do with the ASPCA other than branding. BofA, the card’s issuer, doesn’t seem to donate any portion of card sales to the organization and your rewards aren’t automatically donated or anything else. While the ASPCA Rewards Credit Card offers decent rewards overall, there are better cards out there. The same holds true for its rates; the ASPCA Card only gives you 0% on purchases for 12 months and does not offer a low intro rate on balance transfers.So alternatives are in order. If you want to give a lot to the ASPCA in the short term, the Chase Sapphire Card is the way to go since it offers a $500 initial bonus. Depending on your spending habits, the Capital One Cash Rewards Card (1.5% cash back across all purchases) or the Blue Cash Everyday from Amex (3% at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores and 1% everywhere else with no earning limit) are great options for ongoing donations. The good thing about getting a Capital One Card is that you can customize the entire front of your card with a picture of your choosing, which means you can turn any Capital One Card into a makeshift ASPCA Card if you so choose. Finally, if you want to get low rates, the No Balance Transfer Slate Card is the best choice.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,3,6,1621,1,1
1621,Joe Weider,2012-02-29,3,"Chicago Cubs fans need all of the rewards they can get, considering how much heart break they’ve had to deal with over the years. But is the team’s co-branded credit card they way to get these rewards. I certainly get wanting to have a credit card bearing my favorite teams logo, but you do not want to sacrifice your card’s terms just for branding, especially when you consider the fact that you can put any picture you want on the front of any Capital One credit card. So, we have to figure out whether the Chicago Cubs Credit Card is competitive, branding aside. Starting with rewards, the Cubs Credit Card gives you 3% cash back on gas, 2% on groceries, and 1% cash back across all other purchases. That’s actually not too bad, especially in light of the fact that you get a 10% cash back bonus when you redeem your cash back into a Bank of America savings account (Bank of America issues the Cubs Rewards Card). Moving onto rates, the Chicago Cubs Rewards Credit Card offers 0% on purchases as well as balance transfers for 12 months. That’s not as good as you might think since cards are available that offer 0% for as long as 18 months. Besides, the Cubs Credit Card charges a 4% balance transfer fee, whereas most other cards only charge 3% and some don’t charge anything. Finally, the Cubs Rewards Credit Card requires good or excellent credit for approval and does not charge an annual fee.Ultimately, the Cubs Credit Card is decent and it wouldn’t be a bad choice for those looking for everyday rewards, particularly if you have a BofA savings account or can open one. Still, I would consider a few other cards before applying for the Cubs Card. The Blue Cash Everyday from Amex offers 3% at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on everything else. The Capital One Venture Card offers basically 2% cash back across all purchases if you redeem miles for anything travel-related. The Chase Sapphire Preferred also gives you an initial bonus worth $500-625. I would not get the Cubs Rewards Card if I want low rates. Instead, I’d go with the Chase Slate Card or the Discover More Card that offers 0% on purchases and transfers and does not charge an annual fee.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,2,29,1622,1,2

1623,Joe Weider,2012-02-09,2,"If you’ve flown with Asiana Airlines before, you might be interested in/have been solicited about getting the Asiana Airlines Credit Card. So, is it a good idea? That depends. It depends first of all on how often you travel and how often you travel with Asiana Airlines. Credit cards affiliated with specific airlines are only really worth it for people who fly a few tens of thousands of miles with the respective airline each year. If you only fly with Asiana once in a while, you won’t be able to redeem the rewards you earn with the Asiana Credit Card frequently enough to benefit as much as one’d like to from their rewards card or sufficiently reduce the chances of miles depreciation. I’m guessing this advice will knock out a significant number of people, but if you’re still interested, the next thing you need to think about is what the Asiana Airlines Card offers. The answer is that it gives you 5,000 bonus miles after your first purchase, 2 miles per $1 spent on Asiana Airlines tickets and at select grocery stores (very unusual), an annual $100 rebate on Asiana airlines tickets (largely offset by the Card’s $80 annual fee), and one miles for every $1 you spend on everything else. So, to return to the original question, is the Asiana Airline Credit Card worth getting? I’d say no, simply because of the other very attractive travel credit cards out there.For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card offers an initial bonus that gives you $625 toward airfare and hotel accomodations for spending $3,000 in the first three months. The Capital One Venture Card also offers an intial bonus that gives you $100 in travel and the card basically acts as a 2% cash back credit card across all purchases as long as you redeem miles for travel related purchases. Because these two cards are both more lucrative than the Asiana Air Credit Card and allow you logistical variety as far as what airline you take (even what mode of transportation you want to travel with), they are better choices.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,2,9,1624,1,3
1624,Joe Weider,2012-01-06,2,"With one Brown alum just taking over for another as Penn State’s head football coach (Bill O’Brien for Joe Paterno) the Brown University name is in the news (the sports news at least) quite a bit – not to mention the fact that Chris Berman mentions the school every chance he gets. It wouldn’t be surprising if this little reminder led some of you former Bears to check out the Brown University Alumni Credit Card. But you shouldn’t just apply for the Brown Credit Card because you went there. The general rule of thumb for affinity credit cards is that you should not overpay or waste potential just for a name, a picture or other branding. So if the Brown University Credit Card is competitive, you may want to apply for it, but if it’s not, maybe just go get a sweatshirt or something and show your allegiances that way. Let’s get right to evaluating what this card has to offer then. Basically all it gives you is 1 point for each dollar you spent and 0% on purchases for 12 months. That’s clearly not competitive when you consider that you need excellent credit to get it and the excellent credit market is robust at the moment.You need alternatives then. The exact recommendations I would make differ based on your needs. If you need a way to save on interest, go with either the Citi Platinum Select, Diamond Select or Preferred because all of them offer 0% on purchases and transfers for 21 months. Rewards seekers have a lot of options and which route they take depends on spending habits, but some of my favorite rewards cards are the Capital One Venture Card, the Capital One Cash Credit Card, and the Chase Sapphire Preffered. The cool thing about capital one cards is that you can pout whatever picture you want on your card for free, so you could basically turn any of them into a Brown University Credit Card of sorts. Chase also has a lot of rewards partnerships with major airlines and hotel chains so its rewards are more versatile than those offered by many points credit cards.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,1,6,1625,1,4
1625,Joe Weider,2011-12-21,5,"Yesterday for my little credit card review, I went down to Mexico with the AeroMexico Credit Card. Today, we’re goin the opposite direction with the Alaska Airlines Credit Card. First of all there are two types of people who should consider the Alaska Airlines Credit Card. People who want to take a trip to Alaska or one of Alaska Airlines’ other destinations and could use an initial rewards bonus offering a couple free flights and those who fly Alaska Airlines on the reg, as Kenny Powers would say. I'm not saying this card is good for either group, but the point is that not everyone can benefit from the Alaska Airlines Credit Card. Whether these groups even can depends on what it offers. First of all, the Alaska Airlines Credit Card gives you 25,000 bonus miles upon approval. It also provides a $99 companion ticket discount code whenever you book a flight through Alaska Airlines or Horizon Air. There’s also the 3 miles per $1 spent on those two airlines and 1 mile per $1 spent on retail purchases.In reality it appears that the Alaska Airlines Credit Card is really only good for one group. People looking for an initial bonus won’t find much here, and considering that cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred offer $625 in travel accommodations on any airline or at any hotel, something like that would both be more lucrative and provide more flexibility. The Alaska Airlines Credit Card is a fine choice for frequent Alaska Airlines flyers though, especially if you travel with family.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,12,21,1626,1,2
1626,Joe Weider,2011-12-20,2,"Are you a AAA member? If not, you shouldn’t even consider the AAA Rewards Credit Card. If so, it really depends how lucrative this card is compared to the rest of the above-average credit rewards credit card market. The AAA rewards credit card offers the standard 1 point per dollar spent on all purchases in addition to 2 point per dollar spent on gas, grocery and drug store purchases, and 3 points per dollar on AAA purchases, including travel. That’s about it. The 2.99% intro balance transfer rate for 12 months isn’t a perk since it comes with a 4% transfer fee and there are cards out there that offer 0% for 21 months with a 3% fee.Ultimately, it only seems like you should open the AAA Rewards Card if you spend a lot through AAA each month. I mean, the Capital One Venture Card basically offers 2% cash back on all purchases if you redeem miles for anything travel related. The Blue Cash Everyday from Amex offers 3% cash back at grocery stores, 2% at gas stations and department stores and 1% on everything else. The Citi Simplicity and Platinum Select credit cards offer 0% on purchases and transfers for 21 months.

1627,Joe Weider,2011-12-14,3,"There are a few different BankAmericard Visas, so I guess the BankAmericard Visa Card is the plain vanilla version since it doesn’t have the words “Cash Rewards,” “Fully Secured,” “Signature,” etc. attached to its name. The question though is whether its terms are plain vanilla or as exciting as something like Reece’s ice cream. The BankAmericard Visa Credit Card doesn’t offer rewards (strike 1?) but it does offer 0% on both transfers and purchases for the first 15 months, though it charges a 4% balance transfer fee while most cards with balance transfer offers have 3% fees (strike 2?). Sure, the BankAmericard Visa Card doesn’t have an annual fee, but it requires excellent credit and many other cards with the same approval criteria don’t have such fees either or offer way, way better rewards. I can now say it definitively, Stike 3. The BankAmericard Visa Card just doesn’t cut it in the current credit card market.You need to explore some alternatives then, and what type of card you concentrate on depends on your spending and payment habits. If you have trouble paying your monthly bills in full, you’ll want a card like the Citi Simplicity Card, which offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 21 months. If you want a card with good rewards across all purchases, the Capital One Cash Credit Card, with its flat 1.5% cash back rate is a good choice. If you want a rewards bonus, go for the Chase Sapphire Preferred and it’s $500 - $625 initial bonus. If you want more rewards on specific spending categories, a card like the Blue Cash Everyday from Amex, with its 3% cash back at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on everything else is a good choice, but this obviously depends on your lifestyle. Ultimately, you’d have to try hard not to do better than the BankAmericard Visa Card.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,12,14,1628,1,2

The Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Credit Card requires good or excellent credit for approval, but only gives you one point for every dollar spent, a 0% purchase APR, and a $25 store credit to Nascar.com in return.When it comes to initial bonuses, you can get $625 in travel or $500 in cash with the Chase Sapphire Credit Card after spending $3k in the first 3 months. In terms of the regular rewards earning rate, you can get 1.5% across all purchases with the Capital One Cash Credit Card and 3% at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on everything else with the Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express (and those are just examples). Looking at rates, you can get 0% on transfers and purchases for 21 months with the Citi Simplicity Card. You also get a 7.25% - 13.25% variable APR with the Iberia Bank Visa Classic Credit Card, which is better than the 12.99% - 20.99% you get with the Dale Earnhardt Junior Credit Card.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,12,9,1629,1,4
1629,Joe Weider,2011-12-08,5,"The BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature Card just sounds cool. But the coolest thing about rewards credit cards is saving money, so we need to see how cool the Power Rewards really are. Let’s see, you get a $50 statement credit after making $100 in retail purchases in the first 60 days after account opening. (That’s better than nothing, but $50 is a little small for an initial rewards bonus in the current market, and the whole forcing you into a statement credit and adding the retail purchase requirement to the deal takes away from its attractiveness). The Power Rewards BankAmericard also offers 3 points per $1 spent on gas, grocery and drug store purchases during the first 6 months (this might’ve been a better deal like 5 months ago when gas prices are high, but at least right now it’s not that great). The 1 point per $1 base earning rate is pretty standard, but the fact that it appears to be all you get after the first 6 months isn’t thrilling. Then we get to the issue of the BankAmericard Power Rewards Card being a Visa Signature card. This is important because Visa Signature cards have a feature called No Preset Spending Limit. This means your credit limit will be determined on a monthly basis and you’ll never know quite what it is. It also means that your credit utilization might be reported inaccurately to the credit bureaus and your credit score could fall for no good reason.You should then consider options in the place of the BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature Card. The Chase Sapphire Preferred is a good choice if you want a lucrative initial bonus. The Capital One Cash Credit Card or Venture Card are nice choices for earning ongoing rewards. And if you were drawn to the Power Rewards Bank of America card for the 0% it offers on purchases or balance transfers for the first 12 months, then the Citi Simplicity card (0% on both for 21 months) or the Citi Dividend World MasterCard (0% on purchases for 15 months and some interesting rewards) would both be better choices than the Bankamericard Power Rewards Credit Card.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,12,8,1630,1,3
1630,Randy Smith,2015-06-08,3,"I think there are some good and bad things with this card. A 25 day grace period is nice, in case you are having trouble paying on time but that APR can get a little high. Personally, I would never use a card that could shoot up to almost 23% after a year. The smart chip is an essential tool to have in a new card so I do like that. Again, I would never take out a cash advance with a 15% fee.

Bank of America has the best hours, the most locations and ATMs for my area, and amazing customer service. When I went in and explained my situations, they went out of their way to get my account opened, immediately transferred the monies from my other account, and made it available immediately (which is VERY uncommon). She new all the tricks to get my account open smoothly and quickly, with no wait time at all. She even went out of her way to fax the new bank info to the mortgage company for me and waited well past the bank's closing time to make sure the mortgage company didn't need anything else.

I have it linked to my checking account and I'm enrolled in the Keep The Change program which is a cool way to just edge a little bit more into your savings. It's a really cool way to add to your savings even if you never really bother to save your money. You save either way with this program and I especially like it because it feels like a bonus to what I already in. The monthly fees are pretty low, which is great. There's not much that I don't like about the savings account.

1642,Chad,2014-06-10,5,"I was toying with the idea of opening up a savings account a couple of months ago, and I decided to recently open up one. The process was really easy. I was able to open up the savings account from my phone, which is very convenient. The biggest annoyance about my savings account is the five dollar monthly fee. The fee can be waived if you maintain a daily $300 balance. The whole point of having a savings account is to save money, so I don’t know why you need to pay to save your money. I’m not that good at saving my money, so I felt sticking it in the bank, would be a better decision for me in the long run! I just keep my balance above $300. I just have the basic savings account for right now and I use it for saving money for my trip to South East Asia next year. My next goal is to open an interest bearing checking account and BOA has some good options for those. I’m very happy with BOA for my personal banking and my savings account. The only thing that I find annoying is their fees for maintaining accounts with them. They have great customer service, and when I went into make a deposit the next time, a representative even chatted with me about my savings account. She touched base with some options that I had. It was nice to know that representatives are aware of the changes or things that you’re adding to your account as a customer. My savings account is can also be used as an overdraft protection for my main account. That is a nice perk!

However, my debit card information ended up getting stolen from me and multiple charges were made via the internet from various sites. I immediately called the bank when I realized what was going on (fortunately it was the same day) and their customer service was extremely rude to me. They acted like I had gone out and willing handed someone my information and told them to go run-a-muck. It took over a week and me hounding them continuously to get everything situated. I was very upset with the whole situation and was even more upset with the way I was treated. I ended up closing out my bank account with them a couple of weeks later. It was an unfortunate incident considering I had never had any problems until that point, but I felt so disrespected that I didn't even consider giving them a second chance. Maybe it was the area I am in or the people I was dealing with, but I wouldn't recommend Bank of America to anyone.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,5,26,1675,1,0

Recently I got charged a monthly fee of 12 dollars, two months in a row for having a checking balance below $250. However as a 22 years old student i am not subject to this fee. They immediate accepted to waive the fee and to reimburse me the $24 dollars already charged. I got very surprised because i was expecting to have to fight to get it back.

Then within a month of switching, I would say mid to late 2010 they started assessing fees to their checking accounts. Before the fees were implemented I was very happy with the level of service I received from BofA, I was able to get free checks, anytime I went into a location or had to call a CSR rep on the phone, they were always extremely helpful in regards to my account.

I was transferred 5 times, on hold for over 45 mins. The person finally said she can help ended up lecturing me. It's ridiculous. I have never had that much trouble getting my rewards with Chase or Capital One. I learned my lesson, not all reward cards are the same. I got so frustrated I finally told them to keep all my points, I don't want to deal with them anymore. I closed the account completely on my third and finally phone calls on the same day.

I decided to close it after a Customer Service Rep decided to argue with me about how many times in a billing cycle I can withdraw money from my savings account. My mother worked for a bank so I know the total amount of times I am allowed to withdraw without penalty. The rep was rude and mean. I immediately went to the branch the next day and closed my savings account with them. I also explained to the lady that I saw that day the reason for why I was closing and she repeatedly apologized to me saying that is not how a rep should have spoke to me and was there anyway that they could get me to stay.

Bank of America's app is also a great feature. Being able to deposit checks through my phone is an amazing feature.

Thus I feel I might be missing out on something. The fact that virtually no interest is paid on the savings accounts also makes them rather useless - but that is more a consequence of the current era of cheap money than BoA's fault.

If you have 5 back to back transactions while being overdrawn they will usually waive the fee of four of them and only charge you the overdraft fee once. Overall, I've been very content with the service I have received. I would recommend having direct deposit from your job so that they will waive the checking account fees.

All of my accounts show up in one place; it is really easy to make payments and view my balances. The rewards on this card are also very useful. They add up really fast, and there are a lot of different options you can use them on. I just recently got a $50 gift card to Nike.com.

I've had very poor experiences with their phone support employees, who have been very unfriendly, unhelpful and completely uninterested in helping me to solve the issues I was having with my account. Several times I have made transfers from one account to another, and twice they processed my transfers two times, thus overdrawing the account I was transferring from, and sticking me with overdraft fees.

They do not offer free checking accounts anymore, but if you set up direct deposit, the fee is waived. The features they offer on their online access are quite useful. It is really easy to check your balance or current statement (past ones are also available). It is also really easy to transfer money between your accounts or pay bills.

The biggest negative is that they are almost monolithic in their bureaucracy. However, I have been a customer for many decades and my overall experience has been very up and down. It really depends on who you get at the other side of the phone or the desk. In that sense, they are way too big – do not expect that neighborly service you'll get from your local bank or credit union. As a long, long time customer, I can say that I do not feel honored in any way for my lengthy commitment to the bank. I still get monthly fees and penalties just like everyone else.

This bank has shown great understanding and they cancelled overdraft fees for me when I was low on money in college.I love the “Save your change” feature which rounds up purchases to the nearest dollar amount and takes that change and puts it into your savings account. Recently, I just became aware of the Rewards program through the Checking service.

I'll walk in and won't wait more than 5 or 10 minutes maximum when they are busy with other customers, and bring me right into their office. They always looked out for my benefit and only “sold” me on promotional offers which benefited me, such as letting me know I would get 100$ right to my bank account if I set up direct deposit within 90 days of opening. Awesome! Keep the Change is a GREAT program to be enrolled in, too. In 3 months, you don't realize how much you ACTUALLY rack up. And it's fun to know that in one year, I'll get a random surprise pay day of the matching amount that Bank of America promises to give to me. Online Banking with them is extremely easy and convenient, especially with their mobile app. I can simply transfer funds between accounts when I need money instantly, and even do “Bill Pay” when I forget that its bill day. Based on convenience, I honestly don't see ever switching.

I was, however, very angry at them because after being a loyal customer for so long, they felt it necessary to give me an annual fee of.$39.99 for no reason. They just told me that the only way to avoid the fee was to cancel the card. To make matters worse, I had sent in a significantly large payment and after receiving it, they cut my credit down by 25%, again offering me no reason why when I asked. I do still have the card and they did manage to do one thing that showed me that Bank of America isn't totally heartless. I live in New York and was effected by Hurricane Sandy. When I went to pay my bill last month and I had no payment due. I called them and they told me that they waived all payments for people in the areas that Sandy hit. I thought that was really nice of them.Overall, the BOA cash rewards card is a decent credit card and the rewards are good when you get them.

My accounts fluctuate on a daily basis because of the nature of business and I'm supposed to get a warning when the account is low on funds. Several times I haven't received the warning till after the account is overdrawn already. This leads to fees upon fees that compound on top of each other.

I was young and making money and was just happy to have an active checking and savings account without really reading the fine print. A few years later Bank of America brought on a lot of fees and requirements for having a simple checking or savings account. This wasn't to my advantage since I was young and not making enough money to meet those requirements. I will say that Bank of America's customer service was always great and I knew that they were just doing their job when it came down to all the regulations. I would not recommend banking with them unless you can fully meet their requirements and not get charged an account activity fee every month.

When I was trying to get a loan from them, I was able to meet with someone in the bank, and he was very honest about the situation. I was impressed with his customer service. It is very easy to access my account online and review charges. Compared to other banks I have used, their online services are easy to understand.

Their customer service has been great and when I have had any problems they've always worked with me to fix them. My favorite part of the bank is their Keep the Change program, where checking purchases are rounded up to the nearest dollar and the difference is deposited into your savings account. This is a great way to save some money and it is just change, at the end of the day. The application process was very easy and quick and before you knew it I was a member of the bank. I highly suggest you give them a chance.

1714,Dan G,2013-10-12,4,"The AAA credit card is unlike a lot of cards our there right now, its not a store specific card, or a generic credit card, it is one for the traveling type! If you have long commutes or love to get out of your shell and go places this is a great card. The rewards you can get are mainly for traveling and things that go with traveling like gas, and food, and of course AAA travel purchases. Another nice thing is that you also get some rewards points from getting your car fixed, talk about awesome! This card has some foreign fees if you travel abroad but it still allows purchases out of the US as well. I myself am not much for traveling and like to stay local so I prefer a card more geared to physical purchases like the Amazon Credit Card, it has great rewards on all kinds of purchases.

I will only bring it with me when traveling from now on. The % cash back on purchases is also very nice. I don't have this option on any other card I have. A downside that I find, however, with almost all cards is the fees given such as the foreign transaction fee and the late fee, but this is probably a likely thing with any card.

That experience was with Bank of America, a bank that, in the two years I made the mistake of doing business with them, consistently screwed up my account. On at least three occasions, in two years' time, I would go on the website to check my balance to find a number that was very certainly not correct (and, of course, it was never in my favor). Having that happen was bad enough, but try to get them to do something to fix it and be prepared to wait, even if you happen to need the money to pay bills.

I was careful with my spending, but since I was still a student, I didn’t spend much and had no bills since I was living with my parents. I mainly used the account to save my money and order the occasional item online. Then after not using my account for about 2 months, but having over $100 in it, I got three overdraft fees, which caused the account to go negative somehow. I went into a branch and tried to figure out what happened, but no one could tell me, they just said I had to pay them and get my account back in good standing. I didn’t have the money to do so, and two days later, three more overdraft fees on the overdraft fees came through. I went up to the bank again and still there was no one who would help, not even the branch manager.

I even heard stories of Bank of America trying to implement some fee for using the debit card every month.

In case your card gets lost or stolen it has two features that are really good $0 Liability Guarantee, which helps protect you from fraudulent card transactions, and it also has an extra level of security with Shop Safe while making your purchases online you know you can be safe.

1720,Olga Sunitsky,2020-09-22,1,"My mortgage gets automatically drafted every two weeks. Since they switched to a new system in August, they keep holding the money that got drafted in Unapplied Funds and don't apply it to my mortgage payment. The September statement shows my payment as late, even though every payment was made. I have spent many, many hours on the phone and sent them several messages through their on-line system. They refuse to stop drafting money automatically and they won't apply it to my mortgage. I am considering some legal options in dealing with them. They hang up on me after I am on hold for hours, keep transferring me to someone else or assign me a case ID number, and then do absolutely nothing about it. The people who pick up the phone cannot apply payment from unapplied funds to the mortgage payment and they cannot remove the automatic payment plan. Since this is their mortgage customer service, I am wondering what it is that they actually CAN do besides keep customers on hold for hours on end and transfer them to each other.

I went in to Bank of America, right up to a bank teller, and told her I wanted to close my account. She told me she wouldn't do it and that I had to meet with one of the other employees. She sat me down to wait and I sat there for 30-minutes with no one coming to talk to me. It was as if they were going to ignore me unless I stayed with their bank. I got annoyed and left.Since then I have returned two more times, went to the first open bank teller, and asked to close my account, but again, I was told I had to wait for another employee to call me in their office.

Not too big a deal, right? Wrong.Since I was in the red, they charged me a $35 fee. Still not too bad, but here's where it gets worse. I couldn't pay back the money right away because I lost my job not long after this. Since I couldn't pay the $35 fee, they charged ANOTHER $35 fee the next month. Then the month after that, and the month after that. So because I wasn't able to pay the first fee, they just kept tacking it on until I was $160 in the hole. This is beyond ridiculous. They won't work with me on getting this taken care of either, they demand all that money even though they should have put a freeze on my account after a month of not paying.I agree that I needed to pay the initial fees, but what they want?

1747,Rob,2012-07-24,3,"While I have good experiences with Bank of America's customer service, branch employees, full service ATMs, and quantity of ATMs, I do not agree with some of their policies (being a recent college grad). The policy that I have the biggest issue with is overdraft fees. It doesn't make sense to me that if I overdraw my checking account by $1 that I will be charged $35 instantly. If I sign up for overdraft protection it links my checking account to a credit card, charging the card $100, and putting $100 in my checking account. If you miss paying off your card expect to pay high interest rates. I eventually canceled my overdraft protection due to the fees and running up cash advance charges on my credit card (which I have thankfully been able to pay off). On top of protection fees the monthly maintenance fees that they charge me for not keeping a minimum balance ($2,500 is a little much for me right now) are ridiculous. I am currently paying a $12 monthly maintenance fee on my checking and $5 a month for my savings. I have just about finished switching to PNC Bank which has a much better online banking system / app offerings than Bank of America. PNC also has mobile deposits, owns all of Wawa's ATMs, and doesn't charge any fees for their checking/saving/growth account they provide with their Virtual Wallet Service. Thatâs another thing Bank of America didn't offer--a free longterm growth account!

The first is that they charge you $8.95 a month if you use their tellers (real people vs doing everything online) or have statements sent to your home every month. Also, the interest rate that Bank of America gives customers is very bad, most credit unions have a savings rate that is multiple times greater.

It would have been good customer relations to waive the fee, but they refused to do so. The robotic insistence that the late fee must be paid was utterly depersonalizing. So be warned: years of loyalty are worth less to B of A than $23.88 (charged for a bill of that amount that was overdue by about ten days).",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,6,7,1752,1,3

I recently decided to move on because my experience with the credit cards have been awful. Constant declined transactions even after preemptively calling the fraud department beforehand (out of experience) to approve the transactions - so embarrassing. My cards will get frozen due to suspicious activity, but no text alert, no app alert, and when I call the fraud department, they have no idea why my transactions are getting declined as there is ""no freeze"". It's absurd. The last straw is that I have received about 8 new card replacements in the past 3 years due to it being compromised with a merchant. The sincere inconvenience this causes is ridiculous - I have bills, accounts, etc. that are linked to the card and will cause issues. I have never had these kinds of problems with my other cards, and, with the recent notification of yet ANOTHER replacement card being on the way, I am finally making the decision to break up with BofA.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,,5,21,1755,1,0

1764,Gina Hall,2016-06-16,4,"Caveat: I do not work for Spirit Airlines and agree that their customer service at times is not the best. Nevertheless...If Spirit actually flies to your desired destinations, then you just need to understand how to utilize the rules to your benefit.First of all, if you are husband and wife (or any travel pair), you can get 35K bonus miles (which is 15K for person #1, 15K for person #2 and 5K for person #1 referring person #2).Detroit - Cancun roundtrip offpeak is 5,000 miles per person whereas a typical ticket is $300 - $400 per person. Do the math and decide when to pay in miles and when to pay in cash.Secondly, your miles have the most value when you use them off-peak. Look at the off-peak schedule and travel only during that time (if possible).You can also get partial savings. We booked a one-way to Punta Cana on a particular day using miles and a return flight on another airline using cash and the net cost is less than a roundtrip ticket using cash. Again, do the math!Thirdly, be mindful of the rules. Use your card at least once a month, if only for a $5 purchase at McDonalds.There is no downside to the card. There may be downside to Spirit Airlines in terms of customer service (sometimes) and charges for everything they deem extra - which is everything. Factor this into your travel costs and decide if another airline has a better deal (either financially or ""emotionally"").",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,6,16,1765,1,3
1765,Jeanne Palomino,2016-06-09,2,"Bear in mind, you can have many points for regular purchases but can only use the Travel Rewards points on BoA if you used some of the purchaes on travel. (Eg, if you have 50,000 points, you have to have spent at least $500 dollars- on travel expenses (anything from bus and plane tickets or hotels, to cabs or to buy or refill metro / subway / public transportation fares.) If you have 50K points but only spent 100 of your card purchases on travel, you can only use 10K of your points for travel reimbursement. Also, this card only REIMBURSES travel- and that can be a pain. (See reviews by others below. Travel charges on the card, which are 'covered by points'- you end up paying interest on the charges during the delay period before BoA gets around to reimbursing you for your travel purchase. Big costly whammy there!)Also BoA I haven't tried this yet- but I have another BoA card- regular ""BoA Rewards'. My travel rewards card only REIMBURSES for travel services- and I hear there are costly problems with that. (See reviews below from others.) The regular 'Rewards' card has 'concierge travel service'- where you pay for the travel WITH your points directly.A customer service rep told me I could accumulate 1.5 points per purchase on my BoA Travel Rewards card (the 'regular' rewards card only gives 1 point per dollar charged, so that's not cost-effective) but that I could then TRANSFER the accumulated Travel Reward Card point over to the Regular Rewards card, (with no loss of points) and use my regular BoA rewards card to book travel through the BoA (regular) Rewards card Concierge Desk- and that way the points on the old card's Concierge desk- will pay for the travel costs directly with the accumulated points- no waiting and paying interest on reimbursements.It might not work- it was a suggestion from a rep, I haven't tried it yet. OR it could be that the prices are higher on the Concierge Desk than booking directly- or that might not be the case but - transferring the 1.5 points accumulation on the Travel Rewards BoA card to a regular BoA rewards card might be a solution to all the costly problems people have using the Travel Rewards points or getting them reimbursed.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,6,9,1766,1,3

1770,Nolan Meece,2012-07-30,5,"I have been banking with Bank of America for about two years and I donât have anything but positive things to say about their banking practices and customer appreciation. Iâve always felt more comfortable with bigger banks opposed to the smaller community banks. Bank of America offers that one on one individual appreciation which Iâve always encountered at my local branch with the backing of a big name behind it. The customer service is outstanding and at my local branch in Grand Rapids, Michigan a couple of the tellers even know me by name.My interest was first aroused with Bank of America through their exquisite student checking that they offer for students. If I signed up for an account I would get a $100 cash offer which would be deposited into my account after six weeks (and it was.) Free money is always good! Bank of America offers a great overall eBanking but the one for their students as well as the free money that I got is what sealed the deal for me. My student eBanking includes free transfers which is great!!!! I can easily transfer money between my Bank of America account to my PayPal account. I love buying and selling things on eBay and this transfer makes the process so much easier especially since the transfers are always free. That is a really rarity in banking. Iâm also an Economics major and Iâve got a free MyPortfolio that comes with my account which has been both fun and a learning experience. I get to play with the financial market and stock options, which will be crucial in my future.The customer service is unrivaled. Iâve never banked with any other institutions so I cannot compare Bank of America to other banks but I can base their customer service on other companies that Iâve dealt with and I can honestly say that the representatives at Bank of America are concerned about their customers. Iâve never had any bad incidents where a teller or a representative was short with me. Iâve always walked out satisfied. Theyâve also got a great phone system and the representatives are just as friendly!Bank of America probably has just about as many ATMâs around as Chase Bank. An abundance of ATMâs is a big plus for me. I travel back and forth between Chicago and Grand Rapids a lot. I never carry cash with me so stopping at an ATM is almost a daily thing for me. Since there are so many Bank of America ATMâs around, I rarely have to use another ATM which charges outrageous fees just to withdraw money.I would recommend Bank of America to anyone but particularly students. Students often have limited choices it seems but at Bank of America the options are awesome as well as extra banking options like free money transfers and my favorite tool; the MyPortfolio option.

During the holidays my payment was due Jan 2nd and with all of the goings on I made my payment on Jan 3rd. Well this card has no grace period on late payments and for the past couple of years now I have had an obnoxious APR that they won't reduce despite all of my on-time payments and balance reductions.

The fact that there is no annual fee is important to me and I’m never late with payments so I don’t care too much about the late fees. The points that I collect are pretty cool because things like groceries, gas, the mall, and online shopping are all things that I do on a regular basis. Of course the biggest specific advantage for me is that I have AAA auto insurance and there are a couple of benefits that this gives with regards to travel and retail purchases from AAA.

I've banked with other banks such as Citi Bank and US Bank and one thing I like about BofA is I never get sent to a customer service representative who doesn't speak clear English. In the passed I've had issues with deposits not being posted in a timely manner and overdraft fees which were applied ahead of any deposits. Since BofA has changed their policies, I've been very pleased with them. I currently hold three checking accounts with BofA and an investment account.

The fees are low and I do try to keep my balance fairly high so I don't get penalties, but that's pretty easy to check with the mobile app on my phone too. When I do find fees that I don't understand, like foreign fees, the customer service is really helpful and a big plus is they'll waive them most of the time, if it's your first time, which I think is really nice.

I promptly called the number provided and was connected with a gentleman on the phone. He informed me that I had recently used my debit card at an establishment where data had been compromised and police were involved. Due to this they were going to have to cancel my current debit card and send me a new one. He stated that it would take five to seven business days or I could go to a local branch to get a temporary card. However, there are no branches near me, and that is my only to pay for things he offered to expedite it, he said two to three days. I was very pleased with this, and received my debit card in two days.That was until I looked at my account and was charged $15 for the debit card being expedited. The man never mentioned anything about a fee, so I used their chat now option. I have used this feature many times, sometimes I have a pleasant experience, and sometimes it does not go so smoothly. This time it was the latter. I was connected with someone who was friendly enough, but was not very helpful at first. It took about 25 minutes for her to understand that I wanted my money back because I was not informed I would be charged for the fee. After she realized this it took only a few more moments to get it approved.While I got my money back within a day, it was still very frustrating to have to go through the run around to get the money back.

1815,catherine hiatt,2019-09-02,4,"Overall I recommend it, but let me tell you my specific circumstance. I got the BOA secured card in late 2017 with the $300 deposit. I had really poor credit (low 500s) and had decided that I really needed to change my habits and start rebuilding. The way I looked at this card was a chance to rebuild NOT as a card with any perks. I hadn’t earned that right. I knew I didn’t want one of those “bad credit” cards where they approve you for $300, but your initial available credit was like $175!!After a year of responsible use and on time payments, I called customer service to ask about limit increases. Here is what I was told, and this seems to be different than what I’m reading from others. I should note that I’m also a BOA banking customer, I’m not sure if criteria differs based on that fact. Anyway, I was told I can make deposits (in $100 increments) and that was the only way to increase my limit on a secured card. Also that I couldn’t request graduation to an unsecured card but that it would be periodically evaluated. I will say they were very unclear when these evaluations take place.Earlier this year I decided to start making deposits to increase my available credit, while also keeping my usage low. I increased the limit to $700.Within 6months of making those deposits, they were returned (all $700) to my checking acct and my limit was increased to $1700. I had finally been graduated to an unsecured card after almost 2 years (yes, I called them to confirm this). This has been a slow process but that was a rewarding moment. I’m going to wait a little longer and then apply for a card for above average creditMy only question is, if I had started making those additional deposits a long time ago would my card have been graduated sooner? Could just be coincidence though. My FICO score was 662 when the graduation took place, and I have had ZERO late payments on anything in the last 2 years, since they look at all of your credit report when making this decision NOT just your Americard usage.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,9,2,1816,1,0

I had seen the ad for it on Facebook. The charges were at first credited by BOA and then reversed, making me the victim of fraud. Their reason was because I didn’t catch the charges quickly enough and the company didn’t drain the account completely- so I was basically penalized for them not stealing more money from me. I guess they thought they’d stay under the radar the way they were doing it, and it worked for a while until I caught it. Apparently I didn’t catch it quickly enough.

Then after waiting a couple of weeks, I called a telephone representative to check on the status of the things that should have been mailed to me (like my new checking account debit card, PIN, and new account disclosures). The rep offered that I wait even longer and if nothing appeared to then go into the nearest branch for help (but isn't that why I chose to bank online?). This was strike TWO. I went into the bank a week later after still receiving nothing only to find a branch with 2 tellers (and at the busy lunch time hour). When I got to the window the girl already seemed like she was in a frustrated mood and that proved to be unfortunate for me because she was totally not helpful.

Student accounts are made for the younger generation where there is no monthly fee on having a checking account. Adults usually have to pay a certain fee to per-month that allows them to keep the money inside the bank. They require you keep a minimum amount in your account otherwise you get a fee.

Bank of America pays the checks with the greatest amounts first, then smaller checks. Once I had 7 checks come into my account at the same time. Bank of America paid the largest amount, and 6 checks bounced. I was charged $35 for each bounced check. I would have preferred for them to pay the 6 checks and let the largest one bounce.

A few years ago, they offered $600 to open an investment account with ML Edge, so I did. Three days ago, I logged into my BOA account and they said I qualified for benefits as a Preferred Rewards Platinum Honors Client, which included a 75% bonus to their credit card awards. So, for this BankAmericard Travel Rewards, for every dollar spent, I earn 1.5 standard points + 75% bonus + 10% bonus points = 2.89 points/dollar minimum. That beats my Chase Sapphire Preferred and my Barclaycard Arrival which pays 2.14 points/dollar including their redemption bonus. And the BankAmericard are free with no annual fees! I signed up for the Cash Rewards one too just for Gas and Groceries since it effectively pays me 5.78% on gas and 3.85% on groceries, 1.93% on all others. And both of them give you $100 statement credit after spending 500$ in the first 90 days. These two new cards are now without a doubt, the best credit cards I have.

You'll really rack up points this way and there isn't a limit on points you can earn so you can just keep spending and earning. Other than that the interest rate and other fees seem pretty run of the mill.,Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,9,11,1873,1,2
1873,aadff bdaf,2013-09-09,4,"The BankAmericard Cash Rewards Card from Bank of America is amazing! The initial $100 bonus for spending $500 in the first three months is super easy to reach, and the rewards tiers are pretty nice too. This was my first credit card ever, after receiving multiple rejections from other banks for not having a credit history. I spend a lot of my money on gas for traveling, so the 3% cashback on gas is great! The only drawback is that there is a quarterly limit of cashback on $1500 spent on gas and groceries. However, that's still $45 every 3 months on gas that I otherwise would not have had if it weren't for this card, so it's still pretty great. The 0% intro APR is also nice for situations where money may be tight because of transitions in life or something like that. I would definitely recommend this card whole-heartedly.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,9,9,1874,1,0

I use my credit cards to pay for most of my items, and I really like that I can get 1.5 points for every dollar that I spend, which is more than my current credit cards offer me. I also travel pretty frequently, as I have family members that live out of the country, so earning more points by using it on airline purchases is very beneficial to me.

You can get that elsewhere too. I have had nothing but good experiences with BofA customer service with this card, even when my number got stolen and fraudulent charges hit the account. The online banking system is great too: it’s not confusing and makes it easy to do whatever you need to do. They even have a system for creating a number to use online so that your real number doesn’t get stolen from online merchants. There’s a lot to like here.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,9,6,1876,1,4

It's not much, but the cashback adds up. I also got a 100 dollar bonus from them for spending 500! It's such an easy offer to fulfill, this card is definitely worth checking out if you're just starting out.

I also like that it rewards you, I hear people speak of getting rewards from their cards for spending but I don't think they get as much as this card is offering.

I applied and was approved immediately. I started using the card for small purchases as the market and fast food restaurants and paid it back immediately. It really helped me learn to be more responsible with my credit and also helped build my nonexistent credit rating at the time. I would suggest this to any responsible first time credit card users and would suggest paying it back immediately every time as to avoid fees. Good little card to get you started.,Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,9,4,1879,1,2
1879,Christopher Hopper,2013-09-02,5,I like the BankAmericard Visa Card. It was my first card I got when I was enrolled in college. They gave me a high credit limit and a low interest rate. I built my credit up over the last three years through using this card to pay my monthly phone bill. The payment method every month is very simple if you have a Bank of America Checking Account. You can simply transfer money to the credit card account to pay it off every month without a fee being charged. That's incredibly helpful and convenient if you are a student. Another plus is that their customer service is always top notch and I have always had my questions answered promptly and accurately when I inquire about billing and payments.,Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,9,2,1880,1,0
1880,Mike Hogg,2012-12-26,2,"When I set up my small business 2 years ago and required banking support, I first looked into going with Bank of America rather than my local credit union (which we used for personal banking), as the impression was that for business purposes it was always best to go with a big bank. Unfortunately, they made it quite clear early on that small business is of no interest to them. My online application was held up for weeks as they could not physically comprehend that someone here as a legal resident would want to set up their own business. E-mailed documentations were lost, I had to speak to a different person each time and no details ever seemed to have been saved on their computers when I called. The worst part was that each time it just seemed like the person I was speaking to didn't care and I was just another annoyance to deal with before getting out the door at 5pm. I gave up in the end and used the Credit Union and have had no problems.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,12,26,1881,1,2

I have heard a lot of people speak negatively about them, and telling us about the problems they have had. However, we have never had an issue. My wife recently had her debit card stolen, and a ton of charges racked up on it. BoA was swift and appropriate in their handling of the case. Even though it was her checking account, and it was severely in the negative, they allowed her to spend her money as usual until the claim was processed. We both have checking, savings, debit, and credit through BoA. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a new bank. I like that they have good weekend hours that a lot of banks don't have. They have a great iPhone app to manage accounts, deposit checks via a picture taking program, and transfer money around. I always get friendly customer service in person, and I like that the new banks are getting away from the glass walls between you and the tellers, as it seems more personal now.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,12,26,1882,1,2
1882,Krystal B,2012-12-26,4,"I have been a Bank of America customer for about 2 years. I am satisfied with the company. At first, I had a regular personal checking account. Then, I switched to the online/ATM only account because I no longer had direct deposit so I could avoid fees. This means that as long as I conduct all of my business online, on the phone or via ATM, I don't pay any checking account fees. However, I wish they had straight “free checking” like some other banks. I’ve chosen Bank of America over other banks because they have so many locations and ATMs available so that makes it convenient to do business with them. They offer good promotions. I am a member of the Keep the Change program whereby every time I make a purchase, the “change” goes into my savings account and my savings account grows that way. They had a program whereby they would match whatever I put in but I still have not received my “match” from them. They can be slow in fulfilling their promises in that way. However, whenever I have had a dispute with a merchant, they have promptly refunded my account and assisted in the situation. I opened my account online so it is easy to open an account with them. Every time I have visited a branch or emailed or called them, their associates are always kind, friendly, polite and helpful. They have a free VISA check card with their checking accounts which is great because VISA is accepted everywhere and I can shop just like having a credit card. Their online banking website is secure and easy to use. All in all, I would recommend this bank.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,12,26,1883,1,2
1883,Jessica,2012-12-19,5,"My husband and I both use Bank of America for all of our accounts. While other banks required special documents from him that would have been difficult to obtain in a timely manner (he is originally from Peru), Bank of America welcomed us, stayed with us through the whole application process, and patiently explained all the details. I cannot say enough about the customer service. The application process was also remarkably straightforward – we're a young couple and I was prepared to be intimated by the information forms required. Again though, with the help of customer service, everything was made clear and easy to follow. Regarding problem resolution, we have had two situations arise where we needed assistance: customer service was again swift and accurate in resolving our issues. I am confident that if the bank wants to solve a problem they can do it effectively. The mark down for the problem solving and the clear disclosures is in part because of the fee they will charge (about $7, nominal, but still significant for a couple who doesn't have much) if we want to go in the bank and ask a question. Although I've had a few questions I've avoided going in the bank to ask due to this fee. I've also occasionally found it difficult to determine whether a bill is officially overdue yet or not, and what the repercussions are; when money gets that tight. The last thing I want to do is have the bank asking for another ten dollar bill just to answer a question. Limits on number of withdrawals and overdraft fees have also been slightly frustrating, and were not fully established before we opened the accounts. That said, overall, we are both very pleased with having accounts at Bank of America. I Would definitely recommend it, especially to younger people.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,12,19,1884,1,2

I'm using the ebanking account and it fits my needs perfectly. I don't ever write checks only use my debit card, and I do everything through the website, the app or at an ATM so I have no need to go into a bank location. I would absolutely recommend this bank to a friend and actually have. One of my friends referred me and I've since brought 2 other friends to the bank and they love it too. The only thing that I would have to say I don't like about the bank is the waiting period for mobile app deposits: it takes 3 days between me taking a picture of a check and it actually being available in my account. Also, I don’t like the hold period when I make a deposit at an ATM (there's the same 3 day period) but at least I get $200 of the check available right away from an ATM.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,12,19,1885,1,2

It was a pleasant surprise when they offered the online banking option.The only possible complaint I have about the online banking account is that they really discourage coming into the bank. It is worth it, with the cost savings. Their ATM machines are user-friendly, so the average online banking customer will find that it more than suits their needs.The application process online is quick and painless. Unfortunately I went into the bank and had to wait about 20 minutes, with a squirming child, to set-up my bank account. The specialist was polite, as were the rest of the employees.

I chose this bank because I travel a lot and from my research at the time I found that this was supposed to be the most popular bank in America. At first I liked using this bank but I have found that there are not nearly as many Bank of America ATMs and banks as one would think. I often find myself driving a half hour to find one. I would just use another ATM but when depositing checks the only ATM that I can use is one that is part Bank of America’s network and when withdrawing if I use another ATM I get charged five dollars per transaction! Another issue I have had recently is that my debit card got a small scratch on the magnetic strip on the back causing it to not work a lot of the time. As I said I travel a lot and have not been to my home state in about 5 months. I have gone to multiple banking locations and each time attempt to get a temporary card, which I have been told multiple times that they cannot give me because I am not in the state that my account is active in.

They have very good services and perks with banking with them, but to be honest sometimes the customer service is very lackluster and they seem incompetent.

I've never had any acute problems with it; I've never been charged any fees or anything like that. My biggest issue has been the declining interest rate alongside increasing restrictions. I'm not sure the exact rates, but my interest rate definitely used to be higher. Now, for my more than $10,000 balance, I'm getting like 8-9 cents interest per month. As well, when I opened the account, you could withdraw 6 times per month without a penalty, which is now down to just three. On the other hand, this does provided a stronger incentive for me not to touch my savings unless I absolutely have to, so that's something. On the whole though, interest rates are terrible everywhere.

I have seen a lot of reviews on BOA stealing money or being bad in customer service in terms of resolving issues and I can confirm this because I have had 2-3 other cases with this bank with fraud. So therefore, I do not recommend anyone banking with them because as a loyal customer of 4 years I do not feel like I have been helped in many ways.

1912,Justin Whyte,2020-03-12,1,"BANK OF AMERICA CUSTOMERS BEWARE!A complete stranger walked into a Bank of America in Spartanburg, SC and emptied my bank account of a big chunk of change recently. The bank teller just handed it right over.Fake checks scams often entail using an out of state business check with a value between $1200 - $2000. Bank tellers should know this. This person deposited two of them into my account and withdrew $3000. Both checks were from small businesses in New York City. I feel like this might have been a red flag.What's even scarier is Bank of America's appalling lack of the use of ArtificiaI Intelligence and Machine Learning. A simple AI rule could have thrown up about 20 red flags. Let's see, I never go into banks. Ever. I never go to banks in Spartanburg, SC. I live in Baltimore. I never deposit checks in person. It's always through the mobile app. I never withdraw cash in large amounts. I have no reason to be in SC, depositing checks from NYC.Let me reiterate.

After paying for inspection and paying for the appraisal which came out to over a $1000.00. We approached the time to submit my commitment to my attorney. She than stated I needed we had issues with my student loan amount.  So after reaching out to my student loan department, they gave me the documentation to be able to proceed. My attorney than had to submit an extension during this time to allow extra time for Bank of America. At this time I reached out to Joseph Allend, Michelle Brown's supervisor. She had reached him before me and told him of my situation with my student loans. I tried to reach him multiple times via phone and email. Please keep in mind that I moved out of my apartment with my son and had everything placed for the new home.  On November 10th, the day before my commitment was due she told me that I would not be getting my commitment letter.  When my  realtor called her she stated that she had 40 other customers.

This is my main credit card that I use, since although it has a lower limit than many of my other cards, it has the lowest interest rate and a rewards program. It has periods where certain purchases get you more points, but since I only use credit cards for emergencies and things that will get reimbursed from my job I don't really pay attention to it and just let whatever points I end up setting accrue and use them for a $50 gift whenever I have enough for one. The on-line banking is organized well, and I have yet to hit a limit on how many payments I can make on my balance in a month, which is nice since some other companies do cap the number of payments and I tend to make lots of small payments each month as each reimbursement comes in.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,7,31,1933,1,1

1942,Muneeb Mobashar,2013-03-21,5,"This was my first personal credit card that did not require a co-signee. My main reason for applying for this card was to get the 1,2,3 cash rewards. At first I felt that the rewards were too slow, however as I kept seeing my monthly statements I saw the dollars add up. A great incentive was the $100 cash back for using the card for 3 months and spending at least a combined $500. The money went right into my account at the 3 month mark. I also feel that having your cash backs put into a BoA account is really convenient and the bank gives an extra 10% every time the cash is redeemed and deposited into a BoA checking account. The only draw back is that you have to do it in increments of $25 which is a little high. However, the monthly Bank ""amerideals"" is great as extra cash back ids given if purchases are made at specific vendors. A good aspect of this is that the deals do not have a cap so even if you make a few dollars from the ""Bamk amerideal"" you will get that money in your checking account by the end of the month.

I really can’t wait to pay off this outstanding balance, close this card and move to another major bank that is NOT BoA nor Wells Fargo or to a card supported by a credit union. Other than that, I’ve been particularly okay with this piece of plastic.

I do not pay anything for my checking account as long as I maintain a certain balance, but since this balance is much lower than what I myself ensure I keep as a minimum balance, I have never taken issue with this aspect of my account. Only once have I ever had a real issue with my Bank of America account, and that was when somehow my card was used in Dubai while I was sitting comfortably in a hotel in Los Angeles. I immediately received a phone call from the fraud department and I was asked where I was, to which I replied and was told that my card had been used three times at the Dubai airport. I assured the representative that this was not an authorized use of the card, and she proceeded to tell me that the proper forms would be sent in the mail and I would not be responsible for any of the charges.

Everything was was fantastic for about 2 years, until the place was purchased by Bank of America. The bank took on a cold, corporate feel, and seemed to be run more by the corporate computer than by the local management and tellers.Professional, distanced customer service I can deal with; the part that got me was the fees. My first (and only) overdraft, 3 years into banking with them, was due to an honest mistake. Most banks will forgive you one overdraft, but the exorbitant $35 fee stuck. Then, the once-free checking started costing me $12.00 a month, and they instituted a $2.00 per transaction for pulling money out of another bank's ATM.I can't say that there was a single event that lead me to close my accounts with Bank of America.

The rewards seem really fair, especially when getting gas where they give you 3 percent back which can save several dollars. They now have a new rewards deal going on where particular stores give even larger rewards on top of the usual 1-3% back based on the category of the store you shopped at. I have the card set up to automatically transfer my rewards balance to my checking account when it reaches $25 and it really adds up quickly.

They give you rewards on anything and everything you purchase. They add up if you like to be outdoors. They even have things for everyday uses. Once I received the card they even sent me a coupon for $10 off my next purchase. The Bass Pro Shops card is very good because I had purchased an item for my gun which ended up not being the right part.

We try to use this card for all our gas and grocery shopping to maximize our rewards. This card also makes it very easy to claim the rewards, as it just requires a few clicks on their website.

1959,Gustav Borstad,2012-08-30,5,"This is a great credit card with no annual fee. I like the fact that on top of getting 1% cash back on all purchases, it is 2% cash back on groceries and 3% on gas. Since groceries and gas are necessities you add up points while stocking up on what you need. Additionally, it has the $100 when you spend $500 or more during the first three months (which is quite a leisurely spending pace), and you get 10% more when you redeem it into your Bank of America checking account for a total of $110. Additionally, 10% also applies whenever you redeem any of your rewards into your checking account. Finally, I was given 12 months of 0% APR on purchases, which has allowed me to use the card to try to focus on paying down other cards.

The website for the card is easy to navigate and the few times I have called customer service they have been helpful. You don’t usually have opportunities to earn more than $1= 1 point so rewards do take a while to accumulate.

And if there is not a branch nearby, there is certainly an ATM that is easily accessible. And their presence on the web is really second to none, as far as banks are concerned. Unfortunately, the flip side is that the fees are high - much higher than working with a local credit union or smaller bank. And they charge you a fee for everything!

They were easy to use, didn't charge lots of fees, had many locations, and seemed straightforward. However, they seem to have gotten worse over the years. They began charging fees for moving money from savings to checking, which I found ridiculous. It's my money! I should be able to move it where I want. I also didn't appreciate that they didn't give me any notice when they started charging that extra fee. Instead I had to learn the hard way. They also would unexpectedly lock down my account for times they thought there was suspicious activity. I appreciate them trying to stay on top of things, but it was inconvenient to go to a store and suddenly not be able to use my debit card. None of the times I was locked out were due to actual fraud, so I'm not sure what their system flags as suspicious. I finally had enough when they cashed a check I had written that was over two years old. They shouldn't have cashed it at that point, and this resulted in an overdraft in my bank account along with a fee. I cancelled with them after that, although they still send me junk in the mail. I'm glad I stopped using them when I did, because since then they've added even more ridiculous fees.

I needed to use my bank more often and they just didn't have all the features I needed. I decided on BOA since a friend of mine highly recommended them to me. I opened up a checking/savings account at no cost. I also was able to get my first order of checks for free. I have run into a few problems with my account but they have been resolved as soon as I brought up the issue with them. Their reps have been very helpful and handle themselves very professionally.

Although I believe the laws have now changed in favor of the customer, at the time it was the law that accounts with debit cards were set by default to allow charges to be accepted at the POS even if the charge resulted in an overdraft, i.e. even if there was not enough money in the account to cover the charge. The customer could request the account to be set so that this did not happen, but the reps never explained this to the customers, and the international customers, who often did not have strong English skills, did not know to ask! I would never have thought to ask this myself. It was rather sickening to me that the reps were told to not tell the customers about this, while they handed out plenty of BofA-branded swag bags, mugs, iPod speakers, pens.

1996,Travis Mcilree,2016-01-23,1,"DO NOT USE THIS CARD. This is the worst rewards card that I have ever seen. In addition to an annual fee, the points are valued at approximately $.005. If you pay with points and fly during regular or peak times, a normally $300 round trip ticket will cost you 30,000 points each way. Literally, this is the worst points value that I have ever seen. By the way, after you redeem points for tickets, you still need to pay around $100.00 in taxes and fees per ticket.You are way better off with Chase Ultimate Rewards, Capital One Venture, Amex, Barclays, or pretty much any other rewards card provider.The only reason that I even signed up for this card is because the flight attendant on the flight blatantly lied about points value. She presented it as though I could get a round trip flight after spending around $2500.00.Also, the airline charges fees for anything and everything. I'm surprised that they don't charge you for wearing shoes on the plane. Seriously, look up some of the ridiculous fees.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,1,23,1997,1,5
1997,stevo_h1,2016-01-20,2,"I've banked with many banks, and still have several accounts with large institutions such as USAA, Merrill Lynch, etc. I used the convenient no fee checking that BoA offers that keeps you processing transactions at the ATM only. ALL Web based, etc. Works for me! Right? Sort of. BoA has bad reviews all over for the fees they charge, but I ignored them thinking they can't be THAT bad. I admit, I never kept a large balance, if ANY balance in this account, because I simply use my CC for all purchases to get points for travel. Only on the occasion do I use this account for groceries, eating out, etc. Nevertheless, I paid BoA so many ""overdraft fees"" that were suspicious to say the least. For example. I was in Dallas on business, and the night before I came back I saw the low balance of about $59 left in the account, with only 1 bill Pending at the time. I knew I had a check floating out there, so I decided to withdraw funds from my savings, and deposit it the following morning at 7 am. Mind you, I checked the account the previous night while in bed after 10 pm. I went to deposit, and lo and behold, that check written over a month ago was miraculously charged through. NOT PENDING, but cleared entirely. This over drafted my account, and the money I deposited brought it back up to a single dollar. I called and notified them of this, and they stood by their charge of $35 on the account. Sure, I know this is ultimately my fault, however, the timing of things is what is questionable. This is not the only time this happened. I've had several overdrafts because of EXACTLY this same thing. A check is written, and never seems to go through, UNTIL the available balance seems to be lower than what it can cover. Resulting in an overdraft fee. Each time, I have deposited funds to more than cover it, when it was never shown in the account to begin with, but suddenly it clears with no processing time, or nothing. I find that odd, how some checks will process for 2 sometimes 3 days, but only when there are funds to cover it, but when there aren't sufficient funds, they process right away, and are posted as if they were ran through before any other charges were completed.BoA is killing customers with fees, and it is a shame because most would think I can't balance a check book, but the fact remains, I have enough in my savings accounts to live comfortably. I just don't use BoA for that money because their rates are bad, and they aren't anything more than a pay for pizza bank, and in my book, never will be.Save your money, go with a local credit union, and enjoy higher returns on savings.

We joined the bank just prior to our physical move and do most of our banking online and when we do need to use the branch, we go to the one on 73 near Northcross. With all the negative press that Bank of America has received in the past few years, we have maintained our loyalty and for good reason. We have our checking account, savings account and our main credit card with BofA.Recently we planned a trip to Ireland and received an unexpected call from the Bank just a week before our departure. The customer representative informed us that someone attempted to use our card in Minnesota (we are in North Carolina) by charging $9.65. This immediately alerted the credit card ""watchers"" who contacted us right away. We were told that this is the way these crooks ""try out"" a card to see if anyone is watching. If nothing happens, the crook then maxes out the credit line before the card is closed. BofA closed our account immediately and then over nighted new cards to us in time for our departure to Ireland. This was outstanding monitoring and service on the part of BofA and we are grateful for this!I love the online services and utilize them every single day from home. We have also been very impressed with the service we receive at the actual bank locations (we have used the one on 73 for the most part, but have also utilized uptown and other branches when necessary).

2022,Juan-Pedro Garces-Voisenat,2020-01-03,1,"I started as a Fleet customer back in 2000. It was a great regional bank that was unfortunately absorbed by Bank of America. The level of customer service of BofA got increasingly more deficient with the years, to the point of being reduced to a minimal expression today. The waiting times in their mandatory transaction telephone lines are appalling. Some three years ago, when my checking account balance was more than 50K, due to my level of savings, they practically forced me to change to an interest-bearing account, arguing that I was ""losing money"". On average, they paid me a meagre interest of about 3 cents on 30K. They always addressed me opportunistically as their ""most valued customer"" (no wonder because they profited tremendously from my money balances). In recent months my money balances fell sharply to amounts well below 10K because I became unemployed. Instead of transferring me to my old non-interest-bearing account, they suddenly decided to start charging me a monthly service fee of 25 dollars. It is absolutely ludicrous! They have charged me in one month like 200 times more than all the accumulated interest they gave me. Outraged as I am, I have decided to close my bank account. But it was not enough to go personally to a branch to do the whole operation. They gave me one of their special numbers (which was constantly busy) to do another operation to close my credit card and travel card. I had to find another number online. I called and after waiting for half an hour on the line, the associate asked me how could he provide me an “excellent service”. I stated my purpose and he told me to “call tomorrow” because the people in charge had left for the day. This Texas operator told me that their time was only until 10pm Eastern time.

I always paid ahead on my mortgage.A school board decided to condemn my property. I fought against the condemnation. I decided to pay off my mortgage. When asked for a payoff amount, the the balance was about $8000 high.I went to my branch manager to inquire. After a few weeks, it was determined that the school had made multiple inquiries into the mortgage and the fees for the inquiries had accumulated to approximately $8000. For those who have never had property ""taken"" (condemned) it is an unpleasant experience that has very few rights for you, the condemnee. The School, condemnor, is responsible for paying their fees, by law to keep what happened to me and my family from occurring.Bank of America reassigned the branch manager and informed me that I had to pay off the balance to close the mortgage and I should ask the school to return the funds. They refused to address that their charges were against the law. The school declined to return the funds. I have pursued the matter for years.

2034,Steven Kaiser,2020-07-16,1,"On July 14th 2020, I opened a new checking and savings account with Bank of America using the online method available on their website. I followed all the instructions and answered all questions truthfully. At the conclusion of the process I was asked to wait while my application was being reviewed for approval. Shortly after a message popped up stating that my new accounts were approved. I was provided a link to download their app to my phone. I downloaded the app, opened it on my phone and logged into my new account. As I reviewed the features I learned that I could deposit checks by taking a picture of them. I decided to use this feature to deposit my last two payroll checks. I followed the instructions and successfully deposited both checks. I then wrote “Deposited” on both checks per the instructions from the app. I was informed there was a hold on the checks which I expected but due to the fact these were payroll checks I was not anticipating the hold period would be more than a couple of days. I logged out of my account.Later I logged back into my account and was told that I am locked out of the account and given an 800 number to call. I called the number and was informed I needed to call back during business hours. I made the second phone call on July 15th and after a lengthy wait was told that my account was reviewed by a second person. This person decided to close my new account for suspicion of identity theft, something like that. I was told my only remedy was to go into an actual Bank of America branch and open a new account to replace my closed new account. I asked about how the banks were operating during the virus crisis and only then was I told that I needed to make an appointment first. No appointments were available that day but I was able to schedule one on the 16th at 1:30pm. Because I have a one hour commute to work, I had to miss three hours of work for which I will not get paid. You see, I had been unemployed the previous 6 months. This was my third week on a new job and I had to ask for time off without pay to make this appointment.I arrived at my appointment, explained my situation, she looked at my account and didn’t know what to do. Her supervisor looked at the screen and told her to call the number on it. She called and was put on hold for quite a while, finally spoke to someone that told her they would transfer her call to the correct department, and put her back on hold again. Finally she spoke to someone and when she hung up she told me the following:-	She was going to have to open a new account for me.-	The checks I deposited were going to be held until July 22nd.-	The only way to get the money I deposited into my original new/closed account, transferred to the new account she was going to open today was to make another appointment for the 22nd. At this appointment someone would call this other department and verify that I was at the appointment and then my money would be released into my new account..I explained to the lady helping me about the issue of missing work on a new job plus not getting paid for what I missed. I was told there was nothing she could do, it had to be this way, and asked if I wanted the new account? I told her I need my money and I need an account so reluctantly because I don’t have any choice at this point , yes I want a new account. She starts the process and stops to inform me that there will be a $100 charge to open the new account. I told her that they had enough (all except for the $300 in my wallet) of my money and they weren't getting any more. She went back to her supervisor to see how they could waive the fee only to return and tell me that I had to pay it. That was it for me and I sad no I don’t want an account but I do want my money back. How do I get my money? She said that I would be sent a cashier’s check sometime after July 22nd.All I did was attempt to open a new account, in good faith with Bank of America and in return look at the damages I’ve suffered.-	my payroll income has been taken from me with no definitive answer as to when Bank of America will return my money.-	The new account was going to provide me with the ability to let my employer use direct deposit for my pay. So, even though the first two checks were tied up I would have this week’s pay getting deposited into the account I tried to open. Now, I have to wait until next week to get another check.-	Missed time at work without pay-	I will now have a few bills that will not get paid on time. That means late fees for me strictly because Bank of America took my money.-	Explain this, I was told I had to be at the bank in person on the 22nd to get my money released into a new account. But now, they are just going to send it to me? How does this make any sense at all? It doesn’t, as obviously, in the end, it wasn’t that important after all.-	And finally, the humiliation, lack of respect and absolutely no concern or compassion for me as a human being I was subject to by Bank of America’s treatment is shocking. Not once did anyone enquire about any hardships I might experience as a consequence of their actions. In fact, they wanted another $100, no exceptions, to open an account, which by the way I opened the same account online for free! Through this whole experience I feel the message is clear, “Mr. Kaiser you are a small little insignificant person and we are big, bad, Bank of America. We can do whatever we want to you and there is nothing you can do about it. We stole your money and there is nothing you can do about it. We want more of your money so that you can have the privilege of having an account with us and there is nothing you can do about it.” Well, they were wrong about that because I chose not to give then another $100 and I would never do business with an entity that treats people the way I've been treated.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,7,16,2035,1,3

When I first received it I was given a bunch of miles to sign up, however it was attached to an agreement to pay a fee each year for use. The perks are nice and include things like opportunities for extra mile earning, a companion fair for $80, and opportunity to use the miles with other carriers. The negative aspects of the card include increases in yearly fee, potential expiration of miles, and increases in the amount of miles required for a airline flight.

There seemed to be every possible problem on a regular basis. From debits taking too many days to process, failed direct deposits resulting in bank fees, dropped payment attempts with bill pay to useless customer service...everything at this bank is an issue. One of my biggest fears is that my mortgage will one day, somehow, get sold to Bank of America. I think I'd cry.

I wasn't pleased when my loan was first sold to them as I spent a great deal of time being transferred from one department/person to another. Over the years I have requested many times to stop paper communication, and every time the representative states it will be taken care of, but last week I received a paper statement again. At the beginning of November 2012 I contacted Bank of America and spoke with two different people regarding an early payment I made, and was told there was no record of the payment and the confirmation number I had wouldn't help them. 3 days later I received a letter in the mail stating they attempted to contact me to confirm that I wanted to make an extra payment, but cancelled it because they couldn't reach me. It's frustrating dealing with a company that doesn't train their reps on where/how to look for information. I do enjoy their website though. It is user friendly. It is easy to find information and it appears to be up-to-date.

Fees are not out of the ordinary for this bank compared to any other bank. If you don't write bad checks, they don't charge you. It’s as simple as that.

The customer service representative not only assisted in putting a watch on my account, but gave me further steps to ensure that my information was safe. She was 3 steps ahead of me, which truly enhanced my trust with the bank. My only complaint is that a fee exists if you choose to open a second checking account. There are ways around it (elect not to have money directly deposited), but it does seem a bit unfair to charge an already existing customer more money to open a second checking account.

The website also seems to include more information about your purchases and programs you have signed up for. Even with programs like Keep The Change, they have told me exactly what goes into savings each time. It's been pretty nice!The one gripe I have is that signing up for a new checking account is supposed to credit you $100 on your signup. I thought I looked over the fine print pretty well at the time, but still somehow missed that you needed to setup a direct deposit with the account in order to get the funds.

The only problem I've come across with them is that sometimes they are 'too' friendly. What I mean is I have a large family and we all work together in a family business. So we all have the same last name which happens to be a name from Sicily. Also because we are from Sicily some of our first names might be a little confusing to native English speakers/Americans. We all work and use the same work accounts and constantly transfer money from one work account to another and occasionally to a personal account. The problem is that a few times they have accidentally transferred money to the wrong account. I understand our names are confusing and that its hard to get that type of thing right over the phone but its not cool to try and make a big business purchase and have your check or debit card denied because your bank transferred the money to your brothers personal account instead of to the second work account. It looks bad to clients. Thankfully though the girls working their are super friendly and apologetic and work super fast to right their wrongs.

They were one of the first to update their ATMs to have a great interface that reads checks and can take cash immediately without needing to put it in an envelope. And although I don't have it, I love that they let you put your picture on your debit card as a security precaution. I would highly recommend Bank of America to anyone else especially as I have never had any issues finding their ATMs while traveling across the country multiple times (or partners that accept Bank of America).",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,6,25,2072,1,0

As a student in NYC, banking seemed like a foreign language to me, however BOA has helped me gain and utilize valuable banking information. They have helped me in times of serious rotten luck (I have managed to lose my wallet with my banking card and identification card quite a bit) and helped me keep my head up high.

I have lost my credit card a couple of times and it is very easy to have a new one sent to me by filling out a form online.

I like that I can check my balance without having to call or go to the bank.

Every time I have an issue they are always helpful and do their best to solve my problem. I also like that you can chat with an associate right from your computer at any time. My only issue with them is that I opened my account in California and for some reason California accounts are managed separately from all other accounts so I had to talk to special representatives every time I needed to and it was difficult to get direct transfers from regular accounts to my account to go through correctly and on time. I think the issue is mostly resolved now though.,Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,6,25,2076,1,0

However I usually address them with the customer service representatives and get the matter resolved and the charge reversed. I also use the app, which is pretty handy and convenient. The problem I have with them is that I don't like what they stand for. I also don't trust them.

With that being said, I really love the card and the bonuses that are included (they update cash back bonuses regularly), but the reason I gave this card 3 stars is because of the customer service.

If you try to call spirit customer support they will cut throat to say there is nothing you can do get it back or will not explain the reason why they expired the miles. Also you don't earn miles and when you book the travel using these miles they now increased miles for travel and you need lot of mileages. I strongly advise to stay away from this card.

I asked a friend to make a counter deposit, which occurred n the 5th day. But I was STILL charged the 35 dollar EXTENDED overdraft fee, in addition to the other overdraft fee.

2090,Sara Rybacki,2020-06-08,1,"Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had with a credit card!! Or a company period for that matter! If I could give them a negative star rating, I would. I had autopay set up, as I do with all of my accounts, and it drafted the same, LARGE (over $3000) amount out of my checking account 3 separate occasions. This caused my checking account to be over drafted twice and causing me to incur over draft and line item return charges from my bank (not a Bank of America account). NO ONE was willing to help me resolve this issue that was 0% my or my banks fault. I was finally able to open a case with the dispute team, 2 months later, and after waiting a month for a response was finally told it was my fault that the autopay pulled the amount more than once. I have no idea how they came to that conclusion. I have an excellent credit score with upwards of 13 credit cards, all on autopay, and all paid off every month. I know how things work! I filed an appeal with even more evidence than I sent with the original claim and was told they refused to even review it. I have NEVER had worse customer service in my life. I will NEVER use Bank of America for anything again and plan to tell everyone I know to not use their products. They DO NOT give a hoot about their customers.

I know I am not a big player in the world of finance but I had hoped my loyalty and good standings would have afforded me some sort of respect or preferred status.

My story is simple. I deposited a check valued at over $10K into my checking account on 5/28 and was told ""my"" funds would not be available until 6/9, almost 2 weeks! When I called to complain I was told it was policy to hold larger check for longer periods.

I choose Bank of America because it was a national bank with many branches both at home and where I was heading to school. A few months after graduation, I was no longer able to keep my student checking account. I was at first annoyed that it seemed I couldn't stay with Bank of America any more if I wanted to avoid paying a monthly maintenance fee, but I was pleasantly surprised to learn about this account option when I met with a banker at my local branch. Since I had plenty of savings already to meet the minimum requirement and a steady job, it was a simple choice to get this account. I went from thinking I was going to have to pay for my formerly free account to actually getting paid (al beit a small amount) for keeping my money with Bank of America. The interest rate is not wonderful, but it's better than the rate I get in my Bank of America linked savings account, and interest rates are pretty terrible at most banks these days.

In order to convince BoA that I was in fact the owner of my own account and did not change my name to transfer all my funds to a bank that didn't exist, I had to do everything short of a DNA test to prove my identity.

Currently, my BoA is used solely for checking / credit card related transactions.Anyway, my overall experience with BoA over the years has been pretty okay. I remember when they had the $35 fee that was applied to each transaction that you made when you went over your checking balance which quickly put me into debt for awhile (for a 15-16 year old with no job, it was pretty tough recovering from this) and I resented the institution for a year or two.

2115,Nicole Hanson,2013-05-06,4,"I have had a BOA checking and savings account for a year now and have been very happy. At each branch there are helpful, friendly people. My local branch is especially well staffed. I feel that they are doing their jobs in keeping my account safe and secure, and I they have been very helpful any time I needed anything. The ATM locations are great, I almost never have to worry about those dumb fees when I need cash. They also have lots of ways to circumvent account maintenance fees, which is always a good thing.My only issue with this bank is that they offer me credit cards constantly. It's not forceful, just annoying to be asked every time I talk to a personal banker and get offers in the mail every few weeks. Once I opt out I'm sure there will be nothing for me to complain about.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,5,6,2116,1,0

I immediately went to the bank, and was very thankful to know that none of the fraudulent charges had been processed. I was immediately given the option of ordering another bank card, which I did receive in 3 days.

Other than the checking account, I have a savings account and an American Express credit card. What is really nice is that all three of these accounts are all linked together on the website. After logging in, I can transfer money from checking to the credit card to pay off the balance. When I need more funds in my checking account, I can transfer money from savings. One thing you have to be careful with is that you can only transfer money from savings to checking 3 times a month or you will receive a penalty. I believe this is a federal regulation to help prevent people from using savings accounts like checking accounts.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,5,6,2118,1,0
2118,Eliza Prescott,2013-05-06,4,"I had a checking account with BOA in college, and one day they coerced me into signing up for this card about five years ago. The interest rate was pretty decent compared to the other cards that I'd opened up, and it had a moderate limit, so I was pleased. I put some class fees on the card, paid them off, and suddenly BAM! The card limit was quadrupled. It was a pretty steep change, but I don't mind having the extra credit in times of need, so that was pretty cool. I'm aware that if I miss a payment on this card the interest will shoot up pretty badly, so I'm always pretty careful with it, and things stay alright. All in all, it's a solid back-up card, and if you're young and have fairly good credit, they aren't going to automatically stick you with a ridiculously high interest rate like other cards.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,5,6,2119,1,0
2119,William Lewalski,2013-05-06,4,"I have had a Bank of America bank account since I was 17. It was the clear choice at the time, which was about 7 years ago, for my banking needs. They provided a free checking account and free savings account because I was going to school. After school it still remained a free account until one day suddenly it just magically changed to a different type of account with no notice. I was charged fees without any warning and threw off my account balance from what I was expecting. It was a big problem for me to just have money come out of my account with no notice. Thankfully I called their support number and spoke with someone and they sorted out all of the problems, and even got rid of the charges. I haven't had any other problems than that with Bank Of America since I banked with them. They are a great choice for banking with their easy to use online website, multiple locations, and even apps for your cell phone.

The only problem with that was that the loan percentage was going to be higher than the percentage being charged on my Bank of America card, so needless to say, I decided to keep this credit card.

You can see where and what you spent your money on in order to keep better track of your finances and maybe even start saving a little more. The “Keep the Change” program is also really great. It helps take money that you would usually forget about and puts it into your savings account. The only problem I've run into with BoA is lack of locations if I'm out of state.

Like another large local bank they have fees they truthfully blind side you randomly and for no apparent reason or warning. I am sure they are in fine print somewhere on the back of some pamphlet that no one really reads. Funny I left Bank of America for another bank not too long ago and the very same thing happened there. The “other” bank now has a civil case against them over it.

I never have to go in the bank or even use their drive-thru lanes. That's what I really like about Bank of America. Call me weird, but I'd rather not deal with people and do things quickly myself.

I like their iPhone app, the benefits of my card, including discounts and realtime balances, etc.I think the best world to describe BoA is dependability. I count on them for many a banking task and they have never let me down: whether is a wire transfer, an update to my account or a special request, everything seems to be very smooth.Perhaps their only downside is the amount of customers they have. You could arrive one day and have to face a very big line. I think this varies according to state, but all and all this is the biggest bank so that is to be expected.

I have stayed with them for that reason and because I have my VISA card and checking account numbers memorized. But I have grown dissatisfied with the bank over the years. I feel like I am just a cog in their big banking system, and truthfully I don't know anyone at the bank personally that I could count on for help getting a loan or something else.

Boy, was I wrong. There was no trouble at first. It was what a bank was supposed to be. It held my money and caused very little in the way of undue drama. I had very little interaction with the branches besides depositing checks. Who likes going to the bank? They had tons of locations near me which was even better. As well as very conveniently placed ATMs in case I ever needed money. But then the fees started showing up. 10-15 dollars a month for something that used to be free. The people at the branch were no help in trying to get the fees waived. They would rather me leave than stay a loyal customer. What service were they providing that others didn’t provide nearly the same for free? So I decided to close my account and move to Citi and I haven't been happier since. Let it be a lesson to BOA to try and nickle and dime its customers.

If it wasn't for how strict they were when it comes to transactions I would have given them five stars. I have a great financial history yet I still encounter problems with them almost monthly. I've also found that they have been getting very strict with third party checks. If my father has a check and signs it over to me they won't accept it.

Bank of America has had some hiccups through these rough economic times, but they are just that, hiccups. This company has proven to be a top competitor in the banking industry and willing to meet the needs of their customers.I found that having a checking account with Bank of America, not only ensures great customer service, but many perks I get to take advantage of. Keep the Change and Add It Up are two of the extras that checking account holders get to enjoy. When paying for a transaction, the amount is rolled up to the nearest dollar and the change is placed into a savings account. You have access to the money at all times and this is a great way to help you save money using the Keep the Change program. The Add It Up program is a great way to earn cash back. When you make a purchase online using your checking account, you can earn cash back at certain online stores.Overall, I have been extremely happy carrying my checking account with Bank of America. They have so many extras to offer account holders making them a great choice to bank with. There are numerous branch locations across the United States with even more atms scattered throughout the country.

I have had a pretty decent experience while banking with them but have also had some pretty upsetting moments.It seems that with Bank of America I have had the most difficult time of any bank discussing over draft charges. They seem to never over turn fees until I get to the point of telling them I am truly unsatisfied with how they are running things, and only then do I need to speak with one person higher up who gives me a very difficult time before over turning anything.I know it is really my fault for over drafting, but there have been occasions where my landlord doesn't cash a check for an extended period of time and finally decides to one day when my funds are low. I just won't have the money in my account until the next day that I am paid which in some instances isn't for a few days.

The one time I had fraudulent charges on my account it took two calls to get it resolved, but the second guy I talked to was great.The ATM envelope free deposits are FANTASTIC - so convenient.

Because of those purchases I was charged five $35 over draft fees and a good portion of my paycheck was eating up the next day. I got Netflix to reverse their fee within the week, but Bank of America wouldn't reverse my overdraft fees over the phone.

I called BA, a representative told me that I had to go to an agency during the pandemic to show my ID. When I got there a representative told me that my account was actually canceled and they issued me a check with my funds, that I will receive in about 5 business days. It s not what the representative told me on the phone before. I noticed that I also registered '' my new bank account'' to receive the money from the IRS. I said that to the representative at the bank, he really didn't care. He just told me that I could open a new bank account with them and let me understood that otherwise, I could leave right away. As he was impolite and rude, I said no and I left. As a result, all my money was on hold during the pandemic, just when I lost my job. About 6 business days after, the check was not in my mailbox. I called BA, one more time, to talk to a supervisor. I explained to her all the situation, especially that I needed my money asap. She just said '' you have to wait it is our process''. The check will be sent back to us in case there was a problem with the post office. She didn't even say sorry neither tried to find any solutions. She was like a robot reading some lines.

I applied immediately for a PPP loan, but was closed out because I would have had to have had a credit card and/or loan with them in addition to my consistently abundant accounts. That wasn't the stipulation from the SBA but Bank of America made it theirs. The heat from the news forced them into opening up the loan without the credit card/loan requirement and I immediately applied. I should have known that they did this in order to stop the bad press and but not to really process my application. No matter what path I tried including waiting as much as 3 hours and 57 minutes for a live voice, I never heard one word back back from them by phone or email until the funding for this loan was used up. The first and only email I received from Bank of America was to tell me that my loan application was complete....2 and 1/2 weeks after sending it....and that the SBS funding was no longer available. In all of that time, they did not review my loan which was sitting there and it never got submitted to the SBA. They put my application on the back burner for sure and it was impossible to call them and entirely impossible to have anyone call you back or write you back.

I've had issues over the years with them, but all overcomable, & I'm reluctant to change.

It started in February where $18,945.00 was taken fraudulently out of my checking account from multiple locations across the U.S and even in other countries. It totaled over 250+ transactions. Even when I called Bank of America customer service fraud department at the very same time we were on the phone and I was explaining the panic I was in and frustration of what I was seeing on my account there were still transactions being made. I have filed a police report with my local police department and Bank of America has closed my claim over three times. Every time they closed it they stated “the transaction were made with verification” . I am furious because the money came from a lawsuit of something very traumatic that happened to me. I trusted Bank of America with all of my funds and they guaranteed me that money is insured when it comes to fraud. Not only that but according to equifax my social security and all of my information was breached and that lead to the compromising of my bank account. Even after my first fraud claim with Bank of America I moved all my money into a separate private account with them and replaced my debit card and I STILL AM CONTINUING TO HAVE MONEY TAKEN FRAUDULENTLY OUT OF MY ACCOUNT!

After the 1st year you would have to charge about $3600 to cover the $59 annual fee. Still not a bad deal if you don't mind dealing with Spirit Airlines and you are willing to make sure you make charges every 90 days or less (to avoid loosing your earned miles). Some points with Spirit airlines.. You can NOT cancel your ticket after 24 hr without paying a huge fine.... Generally about $115 or more dollars.... You have to pay to get an assigned seat. $5 to $15 or you get what you get (not a big deal), You have to pay for baggage... Anything bigger than a purse or small backpack... Don't try to bring you 20"" roll on bag to the gate without paying ahead of time... They'll charge you $100 after they start loading the plane. If your not sure about your bad, ask at the gate attendant before they start loading... Carry on or Check in bags are about $47 +/- a few bucks each way if purchased a head of time. Add it when you purchase your flight. You can print your boarding pass at a kiosk by the baggage check-in or online. Don't do it at the counter or they will charge you. Don't call or they will charge you more, just make the changes online. I est. you can earn something around 1.5% with this card, but you need to make sure Spirit has flights that you would like to take. There are not many places I would fly from this airline. Not sure I would want to take a long fight, but the short ones are alright. I figured I would try the card out for a year and see how it goes.

The new way they are actually earning interest!we have been BOA customers since 1998 and in the past these travel rewards points simply were exchanged for a ticket. The new BOA policy stipulates that the customer first pay upfront for the ticket with the same credit card that has earned them the travel rewards points. This way the customer actually pay for their trip upfront.Secondly the money is supposedly refunded the following business day as their travel reward points are redeemed. This is where the system fails and actually becomes fraudulent!Personally this is our experience: Three months later and many hours spent on the phone, we still had not been reimbursed for the ticket we paid for upfront. in addition, BOA also charged us interest for the trip and it was substantial due to the ticket cost.We had repeatedly called the supervisor at BOA travel reward department who had promised to promptly reimburse us for the ticket we bought with the thousands of travel rewards mileage we had accrued. Three months later, when nothing happened, she stopped taking our phone calls!Yesterday an employee in the business card department found our travel miles unredeemed in our account.

Well I don't know how the card was duplicated because I still have that card in my possession, but the signature would have been easy to obtain if they looked at a receipt I signed while there. Make sure you monitor your transactions carefully. Since they denied the claim despite the travel notification that I provided, I will be using another card and will be happy to pay the annual fee if they can provide security.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,3,11,2189,1,4
2189,Joygie,2016-03-09,4,"I applied for my own Bank of America Cash Rewards card after seeing my best friend using one, while we were on vacation. She said it took away some of the guilt of spending money. I use mine to purchase things that I normally would have to purchase anyway, but by using the card, they give me credit that I can use to pay down my card or have it deposited into my checking account. I think it's an awesome benefit. My only gripe is that they lower the cash back amount to 1% after a certain amount. Their customer service is very good. I have always have my concerns taken care of immediately. I always recommend this card to all my friends and family.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,,3,9,2190,1,2

I signed up for a Bank of America checking account and savings account as the nearest branch was right down the road. They have been really forgiving with overdraft fees even if it was my fault. I tried to stop-payment on a check and it was done quickly although I think the fee is a little bit high.

It basically the same thing besides the charge, which isn't really that bad at $12 per month. One thing that I wish that they could be better about is posting things on the same day which you deposit them. I have deposited money after work and been charged an overdraft fee because the money I had deposited the night before actually wasn't available until the next day. Sometimes its not available until monday which really sucks if you make a deposit late friday night. I feel like most people get paid on fridays and some work later then others. I think that they should extend it,especially since its all done by ATMs and computers anyways.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,4,21,2192,1,1

I had no complaints until I received in the mail a claim form for a lawsuit that was filed against BofA for unfairly charging customers overdraft fees. I went over my statements for the previous 2 years and found out that indeed I was one of those customers who was treated despicably. The bank would not post any transactions on the weekend and would show them as pending. When Monday came the pending transactions posted but they would take the highest debit, regardless of the time of the transaction, and apply that to the account first. Then the next highest and so on. The affect this had was that the largest transactions would overdraw the account and the smaller debits would each incur an overdraft fee. They did this solely to take advantage of their customers instead of posting transaction in the order in which they were made.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,4,20,2194,1,0

2210,Yeti Hunter,2012-07-31,3,"As a checking/savings (and former credit card) account customer, I only have one major issue with Bank of America, otherwise they'd receive a 5/5.Listing the positives:1.) When they're being nice; I have immediate access to all information regarding my account,electronically. All debits and potential debits are listed, immediately. Pendingtransactions are listed and my visible available balance reflects the impending debit.2.) Generally, all checks, personal or business, are added to my available balance upondeposit. No wait time.3.) Transfers of money from Pay Pal to my checking account often take less thana full business day. More often, no more than one business day.4.) Staff at branches I've visited have almost always been absolutely efficient andhelpful. Although I understand their main job is that of a sales-person; they'vealways taken a serious interest in my actual needs. They've gone out of the wayto adjust excessive penalties and to assist in international wire transfers (somethingthe US banking system likes to make difficult in most circumstances).My one negative:BOA, like other banks have a nasty practice involving disappearing debits that re-appear in bulk if you make the mistake of keeping less than two hundred dollars in your account for a month. Literally, debits will disappear from your electronic banking statement, and reappear again later. The goal is to trickthe customer into trusting that their available balance is up to date and to overspend, triggering overdraft fees.This practice is currently legal, and, as an aside, it's really up to the customer to keep track of their own spending. Online banking is brilliant however, and performance would be consistent if it wasn't for intentional and irritating practices.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,7,31,2211,1,1

Meanwhile, there are many ATM locations in the area where I live, so I do not have a problem getting cash when needed.

This was of course my fault but when I called most of the fees were waived as it was my first time.

I did a balance transfer a few months back for 0% and paid a 3% transaction fee but somehow they had a fine print and the monthly payment goes up every month. I am going to pay around 80 dollars extra this month because even if I had an auto-pay every month. The supervisor today I spoke to is a Jurk and stupid. Never do a balance transfer from BOA if you are a great client let the people who are irresponsible do the business with BOA so they will have bad loans and go out of business. I am predicting BOA will go out of business because of their lack of training for the staff. I hate this bank and will say to everyone I meet and make sure no one responsible goes through the anger I go through . The only regrate I have is I didn't ask the name of the supervisor otherwise I would have called out his name to make sure he gets some training.I know the location is Texas.I HATE BANK OF AMERICA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,5,11,2238,1,0

Bank of America made it incredibly difficult for me to set up automatic bill payment from my checking account. On February 22, 2020, I was transferred seven times (3 hours); I spoke to confused representatives across the United States. Below is a list of what I experienced:1)	Called 1800-432-1000--transferred2)	Spoke with Erica W. from the Hickory office—she transferred me to3)	Amanda from Nevada—transferred me to4)	Quadica, consumer vehicle lending, in Columbia South Carolina—transferred me to5)	Gina W., Consumer Deposits, from Brea California—transferred me to6)	Robert, New York Office, transferred me to…7)	Luis, New York, Digital Services—who was FINALLY able to fix my problem.Setting up automatic debit, from my checking account to pay a $130 a month RV loan, should not be this difficult. I have used small community banks as well as larger companies (USAA or Wells Fargo) and I've never had this kind of issue.Don't allow a car or RV dealer to force you to use this company! The staff are nice people, but they have NO idea what professionals in other departments even do. 5 out of 7 staff were unable to even direct me to the right place.

Within a few days I received sample checks and a welcome letter with all of my account information. Since I signed up for the online banking only, I can only deposit and withdraw money from an ATM machine. If I use a teller I am charged a fee. However, I have never needed a teller, so my online banking has been completely free of charge! It is so easy to put my checks and cash into the Bank of America ATM machines! I can also take a picture of my checks and deposit them using my smart phone! I have a text alert set up with my account so that I receive a text when my account balance goes below $25.00. In addition, I have a BOA app downloaded on my phone where I can access my account anytime I want. It also shows me the closest BOA locations with ATM machines where I can deposit or withdraw money free of charge! I would highly recommend Bank of Americas free online checking for easy, quick deposits and withdraws.I am also very satisfied with BoA's customer service. A representative contacted me informing me of potential fraudulent activity on my account due to an email I opened that was pretending to be from Bank of America. They placed a hold on my account, gave me a new password and an anti-virus that could assist me in detecting hazardous emails. The man was very personable, polite and easy to talk to.

If I'm getting close to my minimum balance, I get an alert every time so that I can avoid any fees. Also, they don't give you a fee every time you charge your card over your minimum balance. They do it once after a few transactions and they let you get away with a few more transactions before they send you another alert.I've had a few of these in the past because of financial problems but once I got back on my feet and paid off the debt, my credit score wasn't affected by much. This was all with my debit card.Not long ago applied for their cash back rewards credit card and have had it for the past 8 months or so. I'm really happy with it because I got $100 back when I spent $500 in the first month on a train ticket. And I keep getting money back for regular transactions such as groceries and gas. Also, I get no permanent interest until a full year later, which is great because if I do make a cash advance, I pay low interest until I pay off the full balance amount. Moreover, instead of having to end the card and apply for a new credit card, BoA just adds another full original balance amount to my credit card with no interest on it. As long as you use the credit card for purchases, you get money back and no interest ($100 back!!!), which is great for college students looking to build credit and keep their finances in check.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,12,27,2262,1,3

I can’t lie when I went and opened up an account the bank manger was real polite, everyone was real courteous and I felt pretty confident opening a checking account with them, so in fact I did. The moment I walked out their door everything changed. I ended up trying to transfer some money from PayPal into my account and at first it went through from PayPal’s end but then, on Bank of America's part, they told me it was declined, that I couldn’t transfer money from that type of account and so it would be returned. After a week of waiting for my returned money I never got it and so I called their main office and they told me that they decided they could do the transaction after all, but they charged for a transfer fee and an account maintenance fee for two months, even though I had only had my account for only a little over a week. So all the money I transferred got took from them and it was close to 20 bucks. Then I went to close my account and also got screwed out of the money I had used to open the account with, which was 25 dollars.

Today, for example I tried to extract the excess money that was left over in my account (because we pay a small amount over the monthly mortgage cost each month) and transfer it out of their account and into my main bank account. I was asked for my user id, password, city that I was born, they forced me to regurgitate the security code that they sent to my email, then they made me enter not only the card number on the front of the check card, but the security code on the back, and then after all of this, I ended up having to funnel the money over to my credit card at my other bank through BoA's bill pay option just to get my stinking money back.

2275,robert_banis,2020-03-15,1,"In a nutshell, BofA has become very difficult to work with, non-customer focused and honestly does not exemplify the traditional meaning of a bank. Here are just a few items that all add up to my complete dis-satisfaction:1.)	My family have never been charged for accounts, and now all our checking accounts are being assessed $122.)	As my kids were growing up, they saved coin. We used to make it a learning experience to bring in their bags to the bank and deposit them into their savings accounts. In the beginning, they brought in a bag or jar and branches would dispense in a machine and then deposit. Years later you had to ask for paper rolls, roll it yourself and deposit. Now you make it so difficult with rules your steer customers to grocery stores with machines that take 20-30% commission. I think banks should manage and deal with money of all sorts in my humble opinion.3.)	My son went off to college this year, so we went into our local branch to cash in the savings bonds he had been given every year starting at birth from his grandparents for college. To our dismay, the teller told us that he could only cash a maximum of 5. Really???? These are government instruments! We had to drive around Orange County to 4 different branches to get them cashed for his trip off to TX. Absurd really. Talk about not being customer friendly. Not even the manager is empowered to make logical decisions. I almost closed accounts on the spot.4.)	Stopped in the other day to pick up an extra check register, as they only sent a couple with my last check order. Again – just another thing I could not accomplish while in the branch. They don’t carry them anymore and told me I had to call customer service. Well – that was even more of a frustration as your bank sends you to a 3rd party in India (it sounded like) and they wanted to charge me $2 per blank paper register! It took 45 minutes to get through the right prompts, transfers etc. and actually talk to a person. The prompts all kept wanting to order new checks – nothing for registers.5.)	Your website and mobile app have no way of giving you your current balance. What I mean is that if you pay using bill pay, it does not deduct it immediately from your balance until it processes which is usually at least a week out. So – you have no easy way to know your “real” balance until everything clears – this the reason for check registers. If I had to guess even though software change would make lives easier, BofA looks at bounced check charges as a revenue stream. Why make it simple??6.)	I don’t write that many checks, but recently wrote one to a contractor and he went to my branch on the way home. He had all the proper identification, yet they charged him $8.00 to cash my check, from my branch, at my bank! I think this is ridiculous. They even called me to verify which is fine, but still charged him. I was not happy.There have been long periods where I have had $25k as my standing balance and sometimes much more. Interest paid at your bank is embarrassing. I took my recent company stock cash in of $150K and moved it from your institution to one that paid 2% for their premium savings account. Your loss . I keep as little as possible because of the service your organization offers.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,,3,15,2276,1,6

Bank of America has always been good to me in this respect. The fees are low and I am rarely punished for having a low account balance. Sometimes if I do get charged a fee that was a direct result of something I’ve done they are overly understanding and will most likely waive any fees. I like that feature. Good customer service.,Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,4,9,2284,1,2
2284,Liz C.,2014-04-09,3,"I was excited to get a checking account at Bank of America but have not been too impressed with this banking institution. While the customer service seems to be decent and the people are helpful, they do not communicate overages and charges as well as they should. And the monthly fee for the account is ridiculous also, especially when you have your check directly deposited to our account. I think this is just an ""ok"" bank and am not overly impressed.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,4,9,2285,1,2
2285,Kelly Dean,2014-04-09,4,"I have had this checking account for about a year and have been pretty happy with it so far. I generally won't open a checking account that has a service fee, but Bank of America waives the fee if you have at least a certain amount direct deposited every month. I like that I can find branches and ATMs everywhere. We originally opened the account because my husband was travelling for business and we needed a bank that I could access in TN and he could also access in OH. I've been very happy with the quality of service I have received at the branch and via the CS line and I like the ""Keep the Change"" program they have for savings that you can connect to your checking.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,4,9,2286,1,2
2286,Daniel,2014-04-09,3,"I am not too over the moon about the Regular Savings account from Bank Of America. Being a recent college graduate money is a little tight so I decided to save up for a rainy day. So I started my savings account with BoA. $25 as a minimum deposit seemed fine to me and I had to maintain putting $25 in every month or I would be hit with a $5 monthly fee which wasn't too bad. Unfortunately, as someone starting their life after school, sometimes I didn't have the $25 to spare so I would miss a deposit and take the $5 hit. What I didn't know is that when you sign up they can set up the $25 to automatically be transferred from your other account. I hadn't been counting on that so when the transfer went through and took $25 from an account that only had $15 I was hit with a $35 Overdraft plus the $5 fee for not depositing a full $25 a month. BoA wasn't too sympathetic to my case. My advice is to read the fine print and if you want an account just to save a few extra bucks there are probably better alternatives.",Bank of America Savings & CDs,wallethub.com,male,4,9,2287,1,2

2289,Tom Verlane,2014-04-08,1,"I've been banking with BofA for about a decade now. While their customer service has always been decent. I have always felt like BofA is out to gyp me out of dollars I deposit in my checking account. Over the years it's just been one type of fine or fee after another. While often when I notice a bunch of late fees/overdraft fees/minimum balance charges customer service waives some of them, I still feel constantly paranoid that my money is depleting without me even making a withdrawal.I feel as if there are methods BofA has to prevent these types of charges - alerts, overdraft protection etc. but none of them are enabled by default. Once I have finally updated my account to be as transparent as possible, I feel a little bit more at ease.

2290,Liz Oles,2012-07-02,3,"I thought I canceled my BoA checking account about five years ago, but a few months ago, I got a letter stating that my account had been overdrawn by $9. How this happened when I thought I didn't even still have an account let alone checks or a debit card was beyond me. Busy with work and school it took me a few months to take care of the issue and BoA fined me for every month I didn't pay and threatened to report me to creditors. When I tried to call, about 3 months later, I couldn't get ahold of a customer service representative. Finally, I just accessed my bank account by phone, where my reported account balance was $0. BoA had credited the money back to me that month.

2291,Jason Lanker,2012-06-29,2,"I have been doing business with Bank of America for about four years, and my wife and I had always paid our bills through the online banking. We had recently come into some money so we opened a Money Market account. We thought this was great and we were looking forward to watching the money pile up. However, we were never told that there was a maintenance fee if you went over six transactions and the rate was horrible less than .5 percent. After about six monthes we took our money out of this account and opened a new account at a local credit union and didn't have to pay fees and the rate was better. The biggest problem we faced is that it took us three times to close the account, each time we would go in and attempt to close it and they would tell us it was fine. However, we kept getting hit with maintenance fees for having a low balance. Finally, after six monthes we were able to close the account. This bank gave us horrible service and acted each time like we were the problem.",Bank of America Savings & CDs,wallethub.com,male,6,29,2292,1,4

I fill up my tank all the time because I love travelling and getting 3 cents back on every dollar is so rewarding.Don't forget about the groceries though, that's 2%. My wife shares the card with me and when ever she goes down to Wal Mart, she brings this bad boy and it's savings on top of savings.

As a college student, I'm driving everywhere, and I always need to get groceries. Plus, the cashback on everything is nice too; helps me get the stuff I need. I used the card to pay for books when I first got it, and ended up getting the 100 back bonus, which was really nice. I've not had a problem using this card anywhere, since it's Visa and Bank of America. With a max late fee of only 35$, this helps a lot when you're between paychecks and you see the bill come in the mail. I've only had to pay one late fee, but it was only 15.

I make sure to pay my bills every month so I get good credit and all the perks of this card (if you don't pay it off, the interest negates the effect of the cash rewards). Getting cash rewards is really handy and really makes a difference in my budget, especially since I am getting rewards on things I would normally buy anyway such as gas and groceries. No complaints! I feel like I'm getting free money. As long as you pay the card off in full every single month, the bonuses are really worth it.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,6,27,2295,1,2

It encourages me to buy groceries over other things because of the cashback for groceries. Also, since it's affiliated with both Visa and Bank of America, I can use the card just about anywhere, which is great for a college student like myself since we seem to find ourselves just about anywhere and everywhere. I've never had a problem with customer service. Paying my bill is always fast, easy, and problem-free.

Since I only carry my wallet when I'm drinking this was great because I always had my card when I needed it. Before this it could be at home, in my glove box, in my center console, who knows. Was losing that thing constantly!Now I am no longer happy at all. They started randomly charging me 3 bucks every few months and 12 dollars EVERY month for literally no reason.

2297,Jermaine Kanevsky,2012-06-27,4,"I've had my Bank of America Visa card since 2005. I applied for the card because I only had a Discover Card at the time and wanted a Visa that would be more widely accepted by merchants. I pay no annual fees on the card whatsoever (which I really like). I received a great introductory rate as a new applicant (for 6 months) and am periodically sent additional offers for really low APRs on balance transfers from other cards (as well as on cash advances), The standard APR I am charged is comparable with other cards and not too high, I feel. My card happens to be a variable rate (different from a set or non-variable rate so ask a representitave the difference if you don't know how it works) which means my rate can change. However, I don't mind this. It's seemed to work to my satisfaction over the years (andright now my rate is roughly 17-18%). I've always made my payments early or on time so I'm not sure what their penalty fees are. I can say that whenever I have needed them (especially a time or two when I was traveling overseas and called a representative for help) they have been there! Easy and reasonable card.

I generally use my balance to help pay-off my credit card; however, after saving over $300 dollars I was rewarded an additional 25% ($75 dollars) bonus when I deposited it into my checking account. My only criticisms with the card is that the original promotion only lasted 6 months, and that the money can only be utilized in $25 dollar increments.

I don't have the BoA checking account so I can't get the extra benefits, but it's still a great card! Works very well when I travel to other countries (which I do a lot)! The international transaction fee is minimal as compared with other cards. I think that this is a great overall card and extremely beneficial in many ""everyday"" situations.

However, if you are linked up with a checking account you can earn cash back offers which is beneficial. With Bank of America, they have a 0% liability policy. So, if you call and report that there has been fraudulent activity on your account, they are usually pretty good about taking off the charges immediately.

I have a number of other bank accounts for various purposes, and so far feel that BoA matches up very well. In terms of disclosures,I felt that there was some confusion at times, but due to a helpful staff, and seemingly proper conflict resolution, my doubts were set to ease.

They added $1500 a year into my motgage and increased my payments for 3 years. Even though I fought them and continued to dispute what they were doing, they stated they wanted a new more detailed survey (cost to me out of pocket in the amount of $3000). I finally had to get the new survey, which of course totally cleared my property of any flood danger. They then stopped the forced placed flood insurance, but gave me a continual run around about refunding the $4500 they unlawfully extorted from me and would not refund it.

They took the money out of my account (~$1,100), but the associate didn’t realize it was already coming out from the payment I had made through the app which hadn’t been showing, I was out ~$2,200 at this point. They tried to refund it twice with no luck saying that my account was “past due,” even when a manager had supposedly had it expedited for two business days and I had definitely paid off the full balance on my account with the $1,100 (really $2,200). I was supposed to receive my money on Monday and it was not in my account, now I should be receiving it tomorrow. Bank of America has been holding my money for 2 weeks, they owe me ~$1,100 and still haven’t refunded it appropriately, in my opinion they’re crooks and their customer service department doesn’t care in the least.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,12,3,2320,1,0
2320,Cheryl,2012-07-09,1,I had decided to switch banks after a less than pleasant situation at the bank I was using. Switching to this bank however was not a good move on my part. I choose to do online banking for the convenience it would create for me. After opening an account with them things seemed to be going rather well until they start hitting my account with fees. After multiple attempts to contact them via there online support and not getting any place I decided to write them as they so request people to do on their website. However there was no response to my inquiry and the fees keep on coming. I am now in a situation where I am left with no choice other than to decide what my future with this bank will be. Unfortunately this bank as many only look at their customers as a dollar amount figure and not the true people they are.

2321,bradley long,2012-07-09,1,"Overall I am very disappointed with Bank of America because of how they handle themselves. They want to nickel and dime the customer for everything from not having an adequate balance in the account, to rearranging which payments come out first so that it makes you artificially overdraft. I only continue to deal with them because they have a wide availability throughout the country and it costs money to cancel the account with them. If there was no penalty for canceling the account, I would do it immediately and never look back at them. The customer service is mediocre.

There were no fees, no minimum balance. After a while, I forgot I had the account. But out of nowhere, they started charging me maintenance fees and zapping my account with different fees. I almost never used the account, and they just kept taking fee after fee after fee! It eventually led to my account ending up with a negative balance and overdraft fees being charged as well.

I have never had a problem with hidden fees or shady business dealings and I love the convenience of the bank. There are so many ATM's and branches in most of the world.

I was able to call in and they were able to reverse the charge. I then cancelled my current card and they issued a new card that day. I am a big fan of using their mobile banking application on my iPhone. It makes it very easy to check my spending history and to pay my bills right from my phone. I am completely paperless now.

The customer service was average, but now I'm at a credit union where they know me and I have more control over my money. There are less fees. Being a bank, Bank of America is trying to make as much of a profit as possible and that negatively affects me as a consumer. If you want to use a bank, Bank of America will suffice.

2331,Adam Green,2012-07-02,2,"I signed up for a Bank of America checking account when I moved to the Boston area as there were no PNC banks in the area. I only use this account for basic transactions, such as an occasional deposit and ATM transactions. When I first signed up I was shocked to find out that they didn't have a free checking account without meeting one of several requirements. One of which was automatic deposits, so I set that up and went about my business. A year or so later I received something in the mail saying they were changing their requirements and account types. They automatically switched me to a higher account level, with much more rigorous requirements that I was not able to meet and as a result I was paying $15 per month in fees. I went to a branch to get it resolved and they told me the only other option to avoid fees was to switch to an electronic only account, which meant I had to pay for each transaction with a teller. Needless to say I was very disappointed in this option and as a result I have taken my business elsewhere.

2332,Anthony,2012-07-02,4,"Bank of America has been a pretty good bank so far. Some experiences I've had with the bank are good examples of great customer service. For example, there was a time where my debit card number was stolen, and illegal purchases were made linked to my account at various convenience stores. I immediately called Bank of America and was directed to their fraud hotline. Within minutes, my representative changed my account, told me I would be receiving a new debit card (which I received a day later), and told me that the charges would be investigated to determine if I would have to pay. Within a week, I received a letter stating that I was not at fault, and would therefore not have to pay for any of the charges illegally made.Off the top of my head, the only bad thing I can think of in regards to my Bank of America account is the fact that there is a charge for my checking account being in a low balance per month. I have never had any other bad experiences with the bank. There are plenty of banks and ATMs in my general vicinity so I can withdraw money without penalties (which are clearly stated). Some may view that as inconvenient, but in general I feel as they do a good job in terms of the basic banking services I require.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,7,2,2333,1,0

One of my favorite services that the bank offers is the Keep The Change program, which allows me to receive money when I spend money with my bank card.

One aspect of Bank of America that has been a bit of an issue is the order in which they deduct the money from your account. Money is deducted from the account from highest to lowest causing a lot of small bounces for amounts like $1 or $2. One positive aspect is that occasionally they would forgive some of those bounces on the account. Also because of the large number of customers Bank of America mixes up bank cards, I've occasionally received 2 of the same cards. Bank of America is a decent bank but you must stay on top of your account to avoid a lot of unnecessary fees.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,7,2,2336,1,0

Their interest rate is horribly high, even though I have requested many times over the past couple of years for them to reduce it because, in spite of the economy, I have a solid job and an excellent credit rating. They simply do not care. I have a $20,000+ balance on this card but I have never missed a full payment and I often pay more than the monthly balance due. I stopped using this card over a year ago and have just steadily paid down my balance in an effort to rid myself of it completely. Their telephone customer service people are rude and, in all honesty, rather ignorant of what their company's products even ARE. I have spoken many times with BofA's customer service department and, each and every single time, have had to go through a least a couple people before I could be connected with someone who actually knew what I was asking about enough to answer questions.

All this being said, they don't seem to get in much of a hurry at any of the branches I've been to. There are often lines of 3 or 4 people that you have to wait through, but when you think about it that's usually a good thing. If there are people waiting in line to deposit their money, then the bank must be a great place to put your money. I live in the city so I'm sure that rural locations may have much faster service.

Ive had a checking account with them and was really surprised at how unprofessional they can be!! Many of my friends have also had very bad experiences with Bank of America such as charging them unexpected fees, ect. You would hate to get a huge overdraft fee for just going over by a few cents. I have overdraft protections so this isn't an issue for me but the impression I get is that they view the customers as a way to make extra money by picking any extra fees they can out of them. I believe it has just got worse with the passage of credit reform laws also. Also, just because you do business with them does not give them the right to have their people call you nonstop at odd hours trying to sell stuff or services!

During the economic crisis in 07-08, we got a few months behind on our mortgage. We stayed in contact, calling every week. We were told repeatedly that everything was ok, and that the bank had approved an agreement that would allow us to add the payment to the end of the loan. We kept calling, and tried to make payments. The bank REFUSED our payment, (claiming that they couldn't accept anything until the agreement was finalized, but again, telling us not to worry, after all, it was already approved.) About three months later, we received a denial on the agreement, and the banks reason was: (get ready to laugh), we made too much money. We were actually able to hold up our end of the agreement, but... we made too much money for them to give us one.

HOWEVER- IF YOU HAVE ISSUES WITH OVERDRAFTING BEWARE. Bank of america doesn't offer overdrafting forgiveness, and if you let the overdrafting go they continue to charge you extended overdraft fees which are over $30 each time.

A month later and I had still not gotten a new debit card! I went back and applied for another one, and still nothing came!

I really do mean this. I never have to worry about finding a BOA ATM. I think for this reason, the fees associated with withdrawing money from non-BOA ATMs is somewhat annoying but comprehendable. The best way to avoid these types of fees is simply use one of the many BOA ATMs that are practically within driving and in some casesâ¦walking distance from each other. So, convenience is one of the main reasons I stay with BOAâ¦if nothing else.I was able to complete my application for both accounts via the telephone with ease which I really appreciate.BOA and all the other banks charge fees for everything on the face of the sun.

Growing up in Southern California I always had a savings account at Great Western Bank and when it became time for me to get a checking account I also went there. In the 90's Great Western was absorbed by Bank of America and I became a ""valued"" customer of BoA. All was well until I joined the Air Force and got stationed in Okinawa, Japan. On the west coast I could find Bank of America ATMs everywhere, from the grocery store to Petco Park but on an overseas military base all the ATMs were operated by Community Bank, a division of Bank of America. However, Bank of America did not recognize Community Banks ATMs as their own and charged me a $2 ATM fee every time I withdrew money. Since most Japanese stores did not take American credit/debit cards at the time, I would sometimes see over $40 in ATM fees on a monthly statement! As a young A1C making less than $500 every two weeks, $40 was a brutal charge.

Refund came swiftly, although it took me a while to call and get to the end of the request. ISSUE WAS: just the same day and 2 days later I got CHARGED AGAIN from the SAME FRAUDULENT merchant, and BOFA didn't do anything to block it. (And as far as I knew, it shouldn't even have been possible, since I cancelled the card!). Now it's Friday night and their CLAIMS department ONLY WORKS ON REGULAR BUSINESS HOURS, so if you get hacked on a weekend, good luck, hackers can charge as much money as they want to your card until Monday when you can finally call BofA.

I discussed my goals, activity, as well as business purpose with the bank's employee, and I felt that BoA would be a good choice. I have a number of other bank accounts for various purposes, and so far feel that BoA matches up very well. In terms of disclosures, I felt that there was some confusion at times, but due to a helpful staff, and seemingly proper conflict resolution, my doubts were set to ease. Also, BoA is very prominent in my area with his helpful for both my business, as well as my employees.

Each location seems to have friendly employees who are ready to help . A few times I have gone in with problems, whether it be transfers not working or needing some advice, and every time I have left with a pleasant feeling due to the trip. I would recommend everyone switch to this bank if they are looking for a new one. Applications are easy, customer service is great, overall it is a great chain. On top of all of that, there are countless locations, seemingly in any place I have been to. I never have trouble finding an ATM where I will not be charged extra due to it not being my bank. I can also always find branches so I can go in and talk to people who understand my questions.

2422,Marlene Lopez de Santana,2012-07-02,4,When I visited Bank of America for the first time I opened an account to receive direct deposit for my SSI check. I did not know that if I was referred by someone I could get an incentive (in cash) and also the person who referred me as well. So I lost the opportunity though my mom had referred me to that bank. The lady that attended me was very nice and informative but I was also disappointed that there were no more Hello Kitty debit cards left which was something I was looking forward to. They offered me coffee and I tasted some but unfortunately it was awful. I was disappointed as well to know they do not open on Saturdays unlike my last bank did.

Other than that everything's always made pretty simple...I wish my mother had made finances so simple.I also have my business account with Bank of America. I've only ever had to make quarterly visits to obtain records. The staff is always helpful and efficient. I travel a lot for my job as well.

Apparently, someone tried buying merchandise using their online PayPal account with my personal checking account. I was shocked to know this had happened to me and called Bank of America immediately.

I like how the ATM is 24hours and inside it's own room so it's only accessible to Bank of America customers after dark.

I have had issues with my account and false charges in the past but when I called they resolved the issue quickly, refunded my money, and issued me a new card and card number. Keep in mind this was all free of charge which is great when so many banks have hidden fees. One of the greatest perks includes easy transfers of money. My friend also has BofA and whenever we need to exchange money it's easy to hop online and send money to each other without a problem. Another great perk is the different card options that they give you when ordering a new card.

Months later I found out I was not actually enrolled in the program and it was too late to enroll at that point. The lady who opened my account pushed the program and I thought it was a pretty cool idea and asked for it. They refused to remedy the problem. I also never received the 25 checks they stated would be sent for opening an account. I hardly ever use checks so 25 would have lasted me years. Instead, I had to buy some after waiting a couple months and checking back after the free ones never showed. Finally the last thing I dealt with was that the savings account wasn't free... only for the first year. this wasn't communicated to me either. Overall this is the worst bank I've ever had to deal with. Tried for one year, never again. Too bad they bought out MBNA too as they were a good credit card company before BOA took over.

The only thing I can complain about is when I first went to set up an account, I had to wait 15 minutes.I use my debit card all the time and I've never had an issue. Never had a fee. I use the electronic banking, so I don't pay $5 per month on my account.They even have a terrific app for Android that I use to check my balance and even transfer conveniently from my phone. Honestly, there isn't much more I could ask from a bank except for free money.

However, a technologically-minded person such as myself has greatly benefited from the services they offer in terms of accessibility! Their mobile banking allows me to easily check my balance and usage history with just a simple text message; when I acquired a smartphone, their mobile application was a godsend in terms of accessibility and convenience!

2436,Ryan,2012-07-17,4,"Bank of America has been an overall positive experience for me. The online banking is relatively simple to use and understand, and I have never run into problems with my bank account. However, the fine print and restrictions of an account can be confusing and bothersome. For example, I would be charged extra if I made too many transfers between my accounts (I have a checking and a savings), used a teller for my checking account (but not my savings), and other lengthy-worded consequences. This may just be the case for the specific type of account I chose, but it’s something to keep in mind.

The problem is, phone support has not been so great. Even worse, online support is awful. Still, their checking account and website work well. They have ATMs everywhere, which is a big plus. I've stuck with them so far, but I might make the switch to another bank to get better customer service on the phone. Also, their branches are popular, and I've definitely seen lines at some locations get very long. They're not the best, but probably one of the better of the large banks.

2439,Frank Papageorgio,2012-07-17,2,"I was with Bank of America for about a year as a checking and savings account customer and ended up leaving them over customer service issues at the branches I visit. My main issue was that they wanted to offer me free overdraft protection, to which I said “Sure!” Little did I know they signed me up for a Bank of America credit card I did not ask for with the smallest limit I’ve ever seen, which if I over drafted the balance would be charged to my credit card. As you can imagine, I was very surprised and canceled my accounts with them immediately. While it's partly my fault for assuming that my overdraft would come from my savings account, they also didn't tell me they would be opening a credit card for me.Other than that, the banking and checking were fine just like with any other bank. As long as I maintained a direct deposit checking would remain free, and they offered a comparable interest rate on my savings account. There are always tons of branches, so I had no problem finding one, though overall I’ve found their tellers to be slow in comparison to other banks I’ve been with.If you’re looking for lots of locations for basic savings and checking, the bank is pretty average. It’s possible my customer service issues were isolated to the branch I visited, but that is something to consider as well.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,7,17,2440,1,1
