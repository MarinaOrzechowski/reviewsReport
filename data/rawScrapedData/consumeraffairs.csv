348,Gabriela ,08/08/2020,4,"I had many different types of accounts with the Bank of America since opening my first account in year 2008. To date, all accounts operate and have always operated exactly as advertised. Never seen their website down. Never had any problems with any transactions (plastic card, electronic transfers, checks, etc.). BoA is quick to resolve fraudulent charges. Staff members across multiple branches I visited in those years have been welcoming and professional. I believe I am a tough rater, but I cannot think of anything else to even wish for. Through those years of 100% proven reliability I have gained a great confidence in the bank.",,,consumeraffairs.com
349,JD ,08/07/2020,5,"I have banked with Bank of America (BoA) ever since they were NCNB. I’ve seen the highs and the lows, as they say, with BoA development and my own financial challenges. The one thing I will say is that I’ve always been able to go to a branch, or call a number and have an issue clarified, explained or resolved, usually in my favor. Currently, I am a “Platinum” member customer (never thought I’d see the day), so I enjoy a number of perks. I like that I have BoA AND Merrill Lynch at my fingertips and easily accessible on the BoA app. I study the operations of other financial institutions, and while there’s some innovative ideas they present, such as Capital One’s “cafe” set up, I’ve seen those innovative ideas come and go (Washington National [Wachovia] tried it back in the 2000’s). Slow and steady wins it, for me. That’s what BoA does for me.",,,consumeraffairs.com
350,Eileen ,08/03/2020,4,My only problem with Bank of America is they don't have individual health savings account. My company does not offer this as a benefit but my company's health insurance does qualify under the IRS rules as a high deductible health plan. I would like to open one for myself but BOA does not offer it so I need to go elsewhere to open this type of account; which is a pain since all my banking accounts are with Bank of America.,,,consumeraffairs.com

They said it is shipped and it will take three weeks to deliver. If they already shipped then why three weeks within US. (They never send if you order without tracker.) After a month. I ordered again with tracker (27$ + 11$) then they sent and got it in a week. I end up paying double the amount. It's a scam of checks without tracker.",,,consumeraffairs.com
354,Jeff ,11/25/2020,1,I put in a claim for a clear fraud attempt on my account which had every penny I owned stolen from my account. At first they seemed interested in helping me but after 2 weeks when things started to get complicated they just decided to close my account with the explanation of the have the right to do that with no explanation given. Their people were very unprofessional and just flat out rude. In all my years in business I have never been treated with such disrespect from a business. They should be ashamed of themselves and all the people they represent. The leadership group does not have any clue how poorly they treat their customers and I have reported them for bad business practices.,,,consumeraffairs.com
355,Jamie ,11/10/2020,1,I had a business account with Bank of America for the past 15 year. Now with COVID taking a hit with my business income I am unable to maintain the required amount in the account to avoid their account fees. I called customer service and they don't care. I told them that I will need to find another bank that does not charge fees. They said go ahead. I will now be closing all my accounts with them and moving on to another bank. I think it's so sad for Bank of America to put a $16 fee over a long lasting customer that has been hit with large losses from COVID.,,,consumeraffairs.com
356,Patricia ,11/04/2020,1,"I called to ask if they could reverse a $35 overdraft fee, that was added because of an $11 charge that came out before my money got there and they wouldn't do it because I had one taken off in August. I mean during these times with Covid and being out of work. They couldn't even take this off for me and I have been a good customer for 10 years. I am so upset. It just comes at a bad time I have no money to make it current so they could charge me another fee. I think it's time to consider going to another bank that has a better customer service.",,,consumeraffairs.com
357,Amanda ,10/25/2020,5,"Even though it did take me a while to get what I needed from the automated voice operator, the call wait time was very short. When I talked to an employee about interview questions for my school assignment, she was very supportive and kind. I typically have positive interactions with BOA. The bank is able to support individuals to start out and build a future for themselves. They are fair in their business practices.",,,consumeraffairs.com
358,Edward ,10/24/2020,1,The Bank in my opinion is very tough to work with when it comes to customer service and getting service in a timely manner. I have had to spend much time and speak with many people to get any answer and any need satisfied.,,,consumeraffairs.com
359,Tonya ,10/22/2020,1,"I have handled all of my banking needs with BofA for almost 30 years. After all of this time, I made a mistake thinking one of my direct deposits had already been deposited and wrote a check to my son. He cashed the check and the following day two payments, which were already scheduled, was withdrawn from my account. My direct deposit arrived the following day. Bofa did refund one of the overdraft fees but refused to return the other, citing an inability to override the system (a lame excuse, at best). This is the FIRST time in nearly 30 years that I received an overdraft fee let alone two; however, my good standing meant nothing. ",,,consumeraffairs.com
360,Martha ,10/17/2020,1,"Teller mislead, fail to inform me about my check deposit was going to be on hold. For a whole week. I especially asked her was there going to be a hold and she said no. Now the people on the phone telling me that there’s nothing they can do. And apparently as of today they stopped giving any funds till the money is available. I’m extremely disappointed with them for they are not being truthful to their customers. Now I’m having to deal with pass due bills and no money till then.",,,consumeraffairs.com
361,Shannon ,10/15/2020,1,"I have been trying for 3 months now to resolve an issue with a HELOC. An issue that did not happen on my end, but when BOA's systems changed over. They reported me to the credit agencies (my first EVER). Destroyed my credit score. The one person who actually DID spend time with me (almost 3 months ago) couldn't figure it out. Fast forward 3 months, I cannot access my account - I can't even pay off because nobody can give me an accurate amount. ",,,consumeraffairs.com
362,Frankie ,10/15/2020,1,"Above all else is just bad customer service wait times, having to be on hold for over 4 hours for four days in a row is beyond me. Having to explain to each representative my issue and then to be put on hold for 15-20 minutes for them just to come back and say, ""Sorry I have to transfer you to another department,"" and then for that department just to say, ""Sorry I have to transfer you again,"" after waiting on hold from the last transfer.

363,Joseph ,10/09/2020,2,"I have used the Bank of America in Old Saybrook for several years. I live in the Bank's neighborhood and get a chance to observe it closely (one of the few reasons I went there in the first place, I suppose.) I complained earlier in the Covid crisis, as the Bank was closed (other than an ATM), and because of the unavailability of cash in the ATM. I saw, and had personal experiences, as people walked away disappointed with no cash in their hands because of the empty ATM. A second (drive up ATM) has been added. Now I REGULARLY count a dozen cars in line, waiting for non ATM services, that stretches out to the street. My visit to the drive up teller today took 40 minutes.! (I think there might be another person in there, but only one human at a window. ) I actually saw a man standing in line WITH THE CARS to see a teller, obviously not being able to do his business with the machine!",,,consumeraffairs.com

Ok once would suffice, at this point I'm ready to throw my phone across the room... I have no choice though. I have to file this claim so I cant hang up... So I wait...and wait....and wait..

367,Mary ,10/06/2020,1,"I would never use Bank of America (BOA) again for any product nor service! I was a BOA customer in two areas (a Golden Key International credit card and a mortgage). I was pre-approved for a mortgage, but the customer service was so bad as well as the communications that I ended up having to go through Caliber, another company that also pre-approved me. They were much faster and the customer service was far better than BOA's. They also gave me a lower rate than BOA in the end. It was highly stressful swapping to another lender at the end, and I almost lost my condo because of the horrible BOA service and bad communications (and even misinformation) at times.",,,consumeraffairs.com
368,Harold ,10/05/2020,1,Bank of America does not protect its customers. My most recent experience with him was very poor. Someone managed to hack into our account and send up electronic payment monthly. Several months passed before we caught this. We were assured by our local branch that we would be refunded our money. They recommended that we shut her account down immediately. We did so. We patiently waited on our money to be returned to one of our other accounts. We were told this could take up to six months.,,,consumeraffairs.com

First they said that there would be a temporary hold put on the checks until Midnight that night. This was true, and the funds were cleared by when I paid my rent at 6am upon waking. At 6:34 am I received a message stating that a hold was put on one of the checks, but they put a hold on all five of the checks, and refused to remove them in spite of the fact that it will cause my bills to be shut off.

I just spoke with Bank of America YESTERDAY about a transaction the company were trying to pull out by debit. I did a transaction with my checking account for my rent all trying to process at the same time. Bank of America assure me they would correct it, they even went so far to verify the amount that needed to be stopped and company name. I look this morning. The stopped payment on my rent was credited back onto my account and they allowed the other payment to go through along charged me a 35.00 stop payment fee. When I’m done saying what I need to say to Bank of America this morning and they correct this I’m closing it immediately. I’ll stick with my credit union.

Their slogan is we're in this together. I’ve been without my hard earned money for over two weeks now. Now you’re telling me I have to wait another 7 to 10 business days to get a check in the mail.

376,Hong ,09/12/2020,1,Bank of America charges are actually abusive and extremely high interest charges. I had a negative $70 in my account from autopay that I forgot about and they charged me $350 of overdraft fees. I told the manager that my business has been closed since March due to COVID-19 restrictions and asked him there is anything they can do to help reverse those charges. He said he can not do anything unless it’s fraud related transactions and suggested I open a credit card. He said the overdraft fees is not something new and it is something we all need to get adapted to. He does not care how my business or any businesses have been suffering from COVID-19.,,,consumeraffairs.com
377,Mark ,09/11/2020,1,"If I could give zero stars I would, but it makes me put at least one. After we fell on hard times, we were made aware of the H.A.R.P. program. We used the program to what we were told would bring us current on our payments and put us back in good standing. We were told all missed payments would be tacked onto the end of our loan and we had nothing more to worry about. We were shocked when due to the low interest rate we decided to refinance our home and were informed our home had a lien placed on it by these crooks. Now we have to pay $18000.00 to remove the lien. We were never informed of any lien even after these crooks sold our loan to another mortgage company.

BofA mistakenly rejected our regular July 2020 payment on our home equity line, asserting that it should have been sent to NationStar, where BofA transferred our mortgage a few years ago. This was clearly BofA's error. We have been unable to get BofA to correct its error, despite several letters, calls and online communications. BofA is still holding onto our July payment without applying it to our home equity account and has designated us delinquent borrowers. It is apparent that BofA customer service is designed and intended to discourage anyone from using it. We are in the process of closing all of our accounts to moving them to another bank. And we are supposedly preferred customers. Hah! My recommendation is to avoid BofA like the plague.",,,consumeraffairs.com

Was disconnected from the representative. Called back in to finish setting up these accounts. As expected, reached another representation on the second call.

After >1 hour on the phone, transferred 3 times I finally asked for someone empowered to do something. Transferred again I asked this person to give me a number or something in case we were disconnected. ""We wont get disconnected"" he said as he put me on hold again. Then we were disconnected. Like I said, this is typical with BOA so I finally decided to put it in writing to see if I can help them wake up a bit and address the real issues.

I called in to open an online account and I was told that I could not open an online account because I did not have my checking account number and I was also told that I had 7 days to fund the account and that I had to go in person to do so since I didn’t have my business debit card or my business account number yet.,,,consumeraffairs.com

Ultimately withdrew $1000 from my account, separate from my son's account but connected through my wife... Follow that? Well, I couldn't either! Cost ME $1000.00, they couldn't care less when I told them what they did was illegal and I was closing my account! Rude customer service, not helpful at all!

Shortly, we found out that we can apply for a SBA disaster assistance loan, and started the process with the SBA. During the application process we were told that we need to reopen our business bank account. After calling Bank of America, we were told that it was too late to reopen our account. Consequently, we spoke with the SBA, and they advised that we can open a new account, which we did over the phone with a telephone banker.

Back then, boa charged 8$ to even have an account with them every month. Boa literally makes money off the many fees they charge. Similar to Wells Fargo. These banks are here to make money, not to help you save your money. I’d never use boa or recommend them to anyone. There’s banks that don’t have so many darn fees.

Then the tellers changed and there were further delays. The staff are pretty sour and unhelpful. The reason I visited the branch was because I used their drive-in ATM and it ate my debit card. When you're traveling, this isn't a good thing to happen, because you can't get a replacement from your own bank. Bank of America couldn't (wouldn't?) do anything about it, and they couldn't help me complete the transaction that I had started.

Upon viewing the account online as that is the only way to see the balance, we noticed there were Un-Spent Cash rewards (never expired). Trying to redeem them online was futile, so I called only to be told that there is nothing they can do because the account was closed. I asked for a credit to be issued to the card - sorry no can do. So basically they have stolen a couple hundred from us using the card at their recommended partners/vendors. Once a card is closed by either BOA or the consumer the cash rewards should automatically be applied to the balance of the card or checked issued to consumer for the balance unused cash rewards.

I live in central time and made my payment at 11 pm and it was considered late; Mind you it was still on time where I am at. What kind of freakin gimmick is that? Customer service sucks the worst. I literally was waiting for someone to answer my call to ask about that late payment fee and guess what...47 minutes waiting for an agent to answer and nothing!! BOA you can kiss my butt.

They only signed us up to have money removed from our savings account if our checking went over. Overdraft protection should come standard across the board as a courtesy, and you should have to opt into allowing overdrafts. The standard at this company is the opposite, their goal is to allow everyone to overdraft as quickly as possible, so the company can turn profits and take your money.

I am called a Premium Platinum something, something customer but I am treated in a way my own business would never treat any customer.

They only signed us up to have money removed from our savings account if our checking went over. Overdraft protection should come standard across the board as a courtesy, and you should have to opt into allowing overdrafts. The standard at this company is the opposite, their goal is to allow everyone to overdraft as quickly as possible, so the company can turn profits and take your money.

They only signed us up to have money removed from our savings account if our checking went over. Overdraft protection should come standard across the board as a courtesy, and you should have to opt into allowing overdrafts. The standard at this company is the opposite, their goal is to allow everyone to overdraft as quickly as possible, so the company can turn profits and take your money.

777,mike ,10/07/2019,1,"Since our first month banking with this company, we have had nothing but issues with them. Fees we were never told about are being removed monthly from our account(s). We signed up for overdraft protection, that they offered, but they didn't tell us or let us sign up for the REAL overdraft protection. They only signed us up to have money removed from our savings account if our checking went over. Overdraft protection should come standard across the board as a courtesy, and you should have to opt into allowing overdrafts. The standard at this company is the opposite, their goal is to allow everyone to overdraft as quickly as possible, so the company can turn profits and take your money. They are a for profit organization that could care less about you, the customer, or your money. This is the reason you have to pay them if your account does not have enough money in it monthly.

824,Guillaume ,09/13/2019,1,"Called from New York to try and resolve a simple issue related to my credit card. I was transferred 3 times (talked to 4 agents total). Each time, I had to wait about 5 minutes for the next agent to pick up, reconfirm all of my information, and re-explain the issue. The first three agents were polite but unhelpful/not qualified to help. The last agent was rude in addition to being unhelpful. I hanged up after 45 minutes on the phone, with my issue still unresolved. Will go to an actual BofA location to speak to someone face-to-face. What a lost of time... This is as bad as customer service gets.",,,consumeraffairs.com
825,Caitlyn ,09/13/2019,1,"I opened a checking and savings account online with BOA. Got immediately approved, set up my account, downloaded the app, and deposited money. I received my debit card in the mail and a day later received a letter stating they closed my accounts. I called and they had no real explanation as to why they closed my account. I guess they don't want any new customers. I certainly will never be one.",,,consumeraffairs.com
826,Diane ,09/12/2019,1,"I have banked with BofA for several years. My account was recently locked by Joseph ** in the Fraud Dept. He locked my account this past Monday and I have been unable to pay my property taxes which are due on Friday. I have also been unable to get cash or go into my account in order to begin moving my ""bill pays"" to another bank. I have been more than courteous in trying to resolve this both in person at my branch and with Joseph via phone. I spoke with Scorpio at the 800 number provided on my account yesterday when I tried to access my information online. Joe finally returned my call as I was speaking with Scorpio. Joe instructed me that I needed to go to my branch when they open today which I will before he shuts my account down.",,,consumeraffairs.com
827,J ,09/11/2019,1,"Ok, I am away from the country. My check gets placed on a 10 day hold. They have me a $100 emergency credit until the check clears. NO the $100 gets deducted ASAP the following day and still check still on hold. Called 3 different times explaining the situation in a foreign country, a representative states, ""We did put a travel flag on your account."" So, you know I am away in the country still do not release my funds and say there's no history of me depositing any check from my current employer. How you tend to help people when you hold their money for your benefit. I find this bank so displeasing. I do not understand how they manage to keep their clients.",,,consumeraffairs.com
