I went on their social media and left sent them a message direct private message stating close my account immediately, they responded with this is sensitive information. that was a didn't give me any contact info didn't give me what the next steps were just sensitive information. then I finally set up an appointment to go meet with one of their customer service people I don't know what they're called at the branch, I confirm to this meeting but never showed up and in my notes for them to get prepared for what I was coming in for said close my accounts immediately, they still did not close my account and kept calling me and calling me to try and setup a time to come in and meet them. finally received an email from the lady I was supposed to meet with and she was complaining about me not showing up I stated I have contact you guys several times to close my account you have not I'm now copying in the BBB cuz this is unacceptable practices. my account went negative once already waiting on your team to close it nothing ever happened so now I'm escalating it.

One charge was for $***** from ********, a company that doesn't even service my area, and the other was from ******** for a restaurant named Buona, where I've never eaten in my life, for $*****. I called the company within a couple of days, and by June 9th, there was a credit on my account for these two charges and a fraud investigation had been started. My card was canceled and a new card was sent out to me. On July 8th, 2020 the credits were reversed. The company sent me a letter telling me that the orders from these services came from my device and that they match my previous account activity. I reached out to ******** who confirmed this was fraud, and they refunded me $*****. I also contacted ******** who confirmed that the transaction was fraud, but all they need is for BOA to reach out to them notifying them that a fraud claim was submitted. The bank doesn't want to contact the vendor for some reason, and therefore I'm stuck with the amount of $*****. I am still in possession of the card that was used, so I was not negligent in any way. Somehow these criminals got a hold of my card, and I don't want to finance their food or lifestyle. Bank of America needs to make this right. They have a $0 liability guarantee which should be applied in this scenario. I get an e-mail from Vernon White who never answers his phone or returns my calls to confirm my complaint with the CFPB. This avoidance is totally unethical and a way for BOA to work around the CFPB. At this point this is impacting my credit score, and it's not okay.

My mother recently passed away and I am working on closing my mom's accounts and it have been a nightmare working with BofA. My mother thought she had everything in order for her passing - she had a living trust listing me as her trustee, she included her safety deposit box in the trust, she listed myself and my brother as the beneficiary of her accounts. 

They waited a month to send us the paperwork from their internal estate department. The paperwork didn't have very much information in it other than to go into a branch AND they included 3 other claims along with my mom for other people's estates. My condolences go out to the families of *************, *****************, and ****************. We emailed the estate services department letting them know they had done this so that they could get the claims out to the correct families. But we don't know if this ever happened since we never got a response. This was our first red flag. 

Next we made an appointment to go into our local branch since that is what the paperwork said. When we got there the bank told us we would have to come back in a week because we have to wait 40 days from passing. It would have been nice if the paperwork included that tidbit. 

So we come back after 40 days and they take all the information from us and tell us that a check will be mailed to us in 3-10 business days. Well it is day 8 and the funds are still in my deceased mother's accounts. AND I have been trying to get a hold of Brenda from North Toluca Lake branch to get us into mom's safety deposit box for 2 weeks. I finally talked to her today and she says we need to fill out a small estate affidavit and have it notarized before we can get to the safety deposit box.... so in the giant packet I received from estate services they didn't think to include this form I would need to fill out and at the 2 bank of america meeting they didn't think that was something they should have told me so to condense all this back and forth. 

Not to mention the amount of people I have to talk to and explain that my mom is dead and all the questions that come with it. This whole experience has been a nightmare. My mom has been gone for 2 months now and bank of america hasn't done anything to help us in closing out her accounts.

30,Jennifer C,08/31/2020,1,"BACK OF AMERICA DOESN'T CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS AT ALL. 

I opened an account with Bank of America when I was 18; I'm now 40, so I've been a very loyal customer for over 20 years. In that time, I have never once complained, reported any issues, etc.. However, I was recently a victim of fraud when someone online was able to access my accounts, and long story short, they stole over $5,000 from my Bank Of America checking account. I saw this immediately, and was physically at my nearest branch less than 30 minutes after it happened, and had already called in to report it as well. The money taken from my account was sent to an unknown person via Zelle and Cash App. Bank of America promotes Zelle on their site, and has a relationship with them, so I hoped they would be able to at least stop those transactions from posting since all of the transactions were still in pending status. They did nothing to stop the transactions, and instead told me that they need them to fully process before they can do anything. WHAT?!?! That makes no sense to me at all, but I thought, 'OK, this is their process. They know what they're doing.' I now know that's not the case. 

When I sat down with the bank rep, I was shaking and in tears. I couldn't believe this was happening! I just bought a house, and have a new mortgage to pay, but I was assured that Bank Of America covers you 100% against fraud. FALSE! If you read the fine print, they don't cover you at all against cyber attacks such as this. The woman contacted the fraud department on the phone, and as I sat in that office, I continued receiving texts showing money being pulled from my account. She saw this, and reported it to the person on the phone. I provided them with all of the necessary info, and after freezing/closing my accounts and opening new ones, I left with high hopes of getting my money back once they investigated.

I was told the investigations (there was one for Zelle and another for Cash app) could take up to 90 days. I reported this fraud on August 24th; just 9 days later, I receive an email stating the Cash app investigation was closed. They had determined that I would NOT be getting that money back. I went straight to the local branch, looking for an explanation, as the email gave no details of their reasoning. They again called the fraud department, and the man on the phone essentially called me a liar. He said that with fraud, they would NORMALLY see more transaction attempts after the account is frozen/closed, but since they didn't see this happening, it MUST be fraud on my part; they must have KNOWN the account was frozen! I explained to him that they did in fact make another attempt and Cash app declined it because they apparently recognized it as being suspicious. I had proof of this, which I provided to the bank rep to submit. I understand that many things tend to follow patterns, but to tell me my money is just gone simply because something out of what they consider the norm took place, I was devastated. Did they even look at anything else? Did they take into consideration that I was there within minutes of this happening, literally begging them to do whatever they could to stop those from fully processing? Did they look at the fact that the Bank Of America rep saw the texts coming through on my phone stating money was still being taken from my account? Does the fact that I have more money in there now than I have in my 20 loyal years with them not tell them anything? If I were going to commit fraud, wouldn't I have tried that when I only had a few hundred in my account and was struggling? No, they don't care about any of that. All they look for is ANY reason to deny your claim, and to call you a liar and a thief. 

They have re-opened that investigation in light of some additional things I was able to supply (which I think should have been asked for on day 1), and I am currently waiting for the results of both, but those high hopes I had at the beginning are gone. I have zero faith in this bank to actually look at everything I've submitted, and to try to understand how it feels to have your hard earned money just taken from you. At this point, I've reported this to my local police department, and have spent countless hours on the phone with anyone who will listen. Even the officer that took my report said, 'I can't believe Bank Of America isn't doing anything more to help you'. He told me that he wasn't trying to give me financial advice, but that he'd never do business with them again if he were me. Yes, officer, I would say you're 100% correct on that. 

Ultimately, being a ""valued"" platinum rewards customer, and being with this institution for over 20 years doesn't mean squat to them. I'm not a millionaire, but I do have a decent amount of money in my accounts. They've certainly made much more in interest off my money than was stolen from me, but that also doesn't matter.

I do hope that the results of that new investigation will be different, and that I'll receive good news on the Zelle transactions, but I'm not confident in this at all. I haven't pulled my money out yet because I feel like they're definitely not going to try to help me if they have nothing to gain from it. I will absolutely be taking my business elsewhere though if they come back with the same response. This means spending several more hours opening a new account with another bank, going through every bill I pay with my bank account one at a time to cancel autopays and set up new ones, and contacting my employer once again to have them change my direct deposit information. It's a huge inconvenience, but I don't feel safe with Bank Of America, and I no longer trust them. 

If anyone has taken the time to read this entire review, I urge you to take your business and your money elsewhere. Find a smaller bank/credit union that treats you with respect, and actually sees you as a human being, because I would never want anyone to feel like I do now. I feel helpless and defeated. Bank Of America, I wish you would treat others as you would have them treat you, but that's clearly asking too much. 

In the end, Bank Of America is too big to care about one little customer like me (or you!). We're just a bank account number to them, a source of interest for them to profit from, and nothing more. ",Bank of America Mortgages,bbb.org,female,2,False

48,Michael S,02/23/2020,2,"Bank of America's mortgage branch has been in a steady decline for many months.

In March 2020, we received notification from our town that we were delinquent on our sewer tax from the previous year. This didn't make sense, as we have an escrow account for our mortgage; it is the bank's responsibility to pay ALL city taxes, and BofA makes a nice fee from us to ensure timely payment from our escrow account. My wife and I said, ""What the heck do we have an escrow account for if the bank can't even pay your taxes on time?"" We contacted a BofA representative, described our case, and even sent a lengthy email to her describing their mistake. After our call, WE NEVER HEARD FROM THE WOMAN AGAIN, she repeatedly ignored subsequent communications.

Now, here we are in August 2020, and BofA is 'upgrading' their mortgage website. The upgrade has been nothing short of a disaster. We noticed an egregious error on our most recent mortgage statement where the bank was charging over $8k for a 'county tax'. County tax?? Where we live, our taxes go to the CITY,there is no 'county tax'

After a 90 minute wait to speak with a customer support representative, I was told that the new BofA mortgage 'upgrade' had been a huge source of issues, thousands of other customers have seen similar erroneous/inaccurate charges to their account. The representative was brand new to the job, and the system is new, so he put me on hold 3 more times. I was then transferred to a more experienced rep, who again put me on hold, and then shortly after terminated the call. He hung up on me!

We have been customers with BofA for 20 years; I have a mortgage through them in the mid 6 figure range. I have never felt so neglected as a customer after this experience. 2 hour wait, and then hung up on. When time and conditions permit, we will be moving ALL of our mortgage and cash accounts out of BofA. We don't feel comfortable dealing with an institution that has such awful customer service, NOT to mention the privacy and data security concerns of this 'system upgrade'; it seems to me charges from one customer's mortgage are being applied to another customer's account!

In Nov 2019, we rented a car for our wedding anniversary for the posted amount on your travel rewards site and had a $0 balance remaining. We have documentation that proves that. Five months later, in March 2020, we received a bill saying that we owed BoA $317 more due to what we've now been told is an issue between Expedia, Enterprise and BoA. BoA appears to have posted the wrong amount on the car rental price and is trying to shove the excess bill on us instead of paying Expedia due to BoA's error -- essentially charging us $550 for a 2-day car rental, a price we'd never have agreed to had we known. We've filed complaints repeatedly and called all parties. My husband has been on the phone with BoA intermittently since we received that bill, literally spending DAYS on your customer service line by phone only to have reps pass the buck and transfer him between lines. The reps who have actually been helpful aren't enabled to make refunds on their own and have to refer us to the travel center, who is apparently horrendously incompetent. We were given direct phone lines and email addresses to reach out to, only to find a week later that the phone numbers have been redirected and no one responds to email. Four months after that bill was issued, BofA says they've arranged for Enterprise to refund the amount charged; that was due to be posted within 10 business days. It's now been 16 days and BofA has completely gone silent.

67,Rhonda S,10/30/2015,1,"Yesterday, my fiancee received his annuity check from Mass Mutual. He decided that it was easier to just go straight to the Bank of America to cash it then turn around and deposit it into our own account at another bank. And since that is who Mass Mutual banks with and where it was issued from, it should be a pretty straight forward transaction. NOPE. NOT EVEN CLOSE. The bank employee pretty much gave him the run-around and said that there was nothing that he could do for him since he was not an account holder with them. But that he could use the check as a deposit in order to open up an account. All that the teller had to do was go on his computer to verify that the funds were in Mass Mutual's account then issue him a cashier's check for remaining total (minus check cashing and cashier's check fees). So bottom line was this: if you are not an account holder at BOA, they will not cash a check for you even if the check issuer is a BOA account holder BUT if you open an account with them then they will go through the motions of verifying funds for the check. 
As for the check, we went to our own bank and had no problems. Our banking teller called BOA and verified that funds were available, deposited the check into our account, issued us a portion of it up front and the rest would be available the next business day.

I bank with 5/3 regarding ** checking account.  ** auto loan is with Bank Of America.  I wanted to setup auto bill pay on their website which I did.  Since I am not a Bank Of America checking customer any payment that I make over the payment amount is NOT applied as a curtailment.  The customer service representative stated that any overage payment I made went towards next months payment and principal.  Seems like a conflict of interest or just unethical to only accept curtailment payments from Bank of America customers.  To be fair, they did offer to mail out a paper request to return a check to setup an extra payment for principal however...** wife and I have separate checking accounts and her name is on the auto loan so they won't accept this from ** checking account.

My boss said ""I have never had any checks being returned and that's how I pay all of my emplooyees and never have an issue.

I applied for accounts online because I had been sick and needed a way for family to send me money for my bills. I answered the security questions and then transferred $25.00 to a checking account. On Saturday I tried to access my account online via the app and was told my account was locked. Then the next day I received a debit card and tried to activate it but the automated system said there was no account found. This whole time I couldn't contact BOA because they're not opened on the weekends so I had to wait until Monday. Once I contact them on Monday, April 6th, I was informed by a CSR the accounts had been closed because they could not verify information. I asked about the money and he said it was sent out via check on April 1st. No one contacted me from BOA to verify information or to inform me my account had been closed and a check had been sent. Then I asked the CSR how do I file a complaint to which he replied to me that he didn't know how to. I had to have him escalate me to a supervisor to file a complaint to which she didn't apologize or show any form of empathy for the situation I was in. Just silence and typing then asked me if there was anything else. That's it! This is so irresponsible of BOA to just close accounts without informing people.

108,Sandy,05/31/2020,1,"As, a small business owner severely impacted by Covid-19, we have been frantically awaiting PPP loans to be rolled out. 

We have banked with Bank of America since 1992, for personal checking accounts, savings, personal credit cards, merchant services and Business Checking Accounts. 

After anxiously awaiting this day, to our surprise, when we tried to apply, we read the horrifying words, ""DO NOT QUALIFY to apply.""

In searching why, we found that having banked with them for all the reasons listed above, is not enough. We ALSO NEED a pre-existing business line of credit with them, in order to qualify to apply for the PPP loan. 

We have never had a need for a business line of credit, so never opened one of these accounts with them. Now, in time of need, we cannot even count on our bank, that we have been loyal to all these years, to help us apply for the PPP loan, simply because we never previously had a need for a business line of credit?

What are we left to do here? We are in dire need of this loan, as our business and personal livelihood is now in immediate jeopardy. 

Out of desperation, we immediately contacted other major banks such as Chase Bank and CitiBank to find out if we can apply with them, hoping that since we have personal credit  lines with them we could somehow qualify, BUT were told that because we do not have a business checking account with them we do not qualify. 

These other banks, such as***************** have basic requirements to apply for this PPP loans- a business checking account would suffice.

 It just so happens to be that we do seemingly wrongfully chose to our long-time banking with Bank of America, that has more stringent criteria to apply, in this time of need!

It is a government loan, simply funded through BofA, it should be unlawful this bank put such requirements, to apply for it. 

In reading other reviews, it looks like many of us are dealing with the same issue here. We need to stand together and voice our concerns. All, please contact Governor Newsom's office website, White House website and/or local media websites via contact us forms to express your concerns. Let's make this a problem enough, to produce change!

These requirements MUST  change, before many business owners, banking with this unethical bank, go under.

On ******** - I was fully approved for a bank loan for a car and received an email to call and finalize my details. The day my car arrived, 14 days after the initial approval, I called B of A to finalize my details.

They asked for my social oh, they asked for my address, they asked for my birthday. Said thank you. Then... She asked me if I had dual residency in two residences. I said no. She said okay we are declining your application because we cannot verify your address in our third party system. I asked her if there was another way to verify, she said no. I asked if the address in their system was my previous address, and she verified that it was. I asked if I could have the name of the system they were using, she said no. I told her the system they were using has outdated information, I then asked how long it takes for information to update. She said she didn't know. It's been 3 months since I changed my address, actually closer to about a 100-105 days. 

I asked to speak with a supervisor - they take 2 days to call you back if at all. There's no way to dispute a declined application, or incorrect information, or give them updated information, nor is there a way to contact their third party system and make sure that they're providing correct information.

when I told the woman on the phone that she was being rude and not providing me any method of resolution, she told me she was sorry that I felt that way.

America is a multi billion trillion dollar company, I cannot believe that they think that going cheap on a third-party verification system is the right way to do business.

142,alexandria q,07/24/2020,1,"I remember being young and naive, opening up my first debit card with Bank of America as a teenager. Excited as all get out. I've been with Bank of America for a long time--about 14 years. My parents have been with Bank of America for over 30, before it was even called that (they said it had a different name).

 

Growing up I was taught to trust adults, to believe what people say. As I have gotten older, my upbringing influenced my decision-making.

 

Last year, I opened up my first Business Checking account with Bank of America as well as an Account that I was told could earn my business Travel Awards. The idea of working my tail off and fighting to make my business a success, and feeling like my bank had my back felt like the true American Dream. I was going to make it happen. If I failed, I would try harder.

 

Late last year, a teller at a gas station intentionally did not give me back my card. She swiped it for the person behind me, and he stole it. I wasn't aware I didn't have it till I left, going to the bank to deposit checks. 

 

Within 10 minutes, I realized I didn't have it. It was too late. I had left my phone at home, and it took an eternity to get through Bank of America's automated system to get to an actual human being to freeze my card. By then, quite a sum had been spent. 

 

But Bank of America had me. The lady was calm and sweet on the phone as I sobbed. She was reassuring. 

 

The money was back within my account as a credit and a temporary card issued as well as a permanent within days. An investigation was opened in my county. I was so happy that Bank of America was willing to work with me to get my hard earned money back. I worked with them and the police as much as I could to track the person who stole my card down (who happened to be part of a crime ring, of course). 

 

Turns out justice isn't so just. I won't go into that part.

 

I budget my money on another app not connected to Bank of America, as theirs is inadequate for my needs. I keep receipts and log all my purchases to the ""T."" Routinely, I manually log and track and compute things by hand with calculator.

 

Up until my card got stolen, all my numbers matched. 

 

Afterward, money started to ""magically"" disappear from my account. I thought I was losing my mind. I spent countless hours rechecking my calculations, only to continue to get higher numbers in my accounts (I have multiple accounts). I went to Bank of America reps for help, only for them to tell me that it must have been a problem with my numbers or algorithms in the app. I believed them. God, why did I believe them?

 

By the end of November, I ended up have a discrepancy of almost $300, close to the amount that was stolen from my credit card. So, did Bank of America really cover me for my loses? Or did they lie to me? 

 

I decided to go to a specialist I trusted, and have her do an audit. I told her in faith, everything. I prayed. The audit started. 

 

Bank of America closed it within days and gave me no details. 

 

I was too overwhelmed to do anything. I just quit. I just let them have it at that point, praying to the heavens that this wouldn't happen again. I logged the huge account balance deficit, and fought my way through the hectic holidays.

 

Fast forward to yesterday. Minding my business, doing my business, I was manually logging bills again by hand and in the app. Everything matched. I breathed a massive sigh of relief and was about to go about my day.

 

And it happened. RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES. 

 

I watched as I switched screens in my banking app and my account balance dropped $30. Like. MAGIC. INSTANTLY. No transactions were made. No pending transactions. No transfers. NO-THING. 

 

I almost went nuts. Then you know what I realized?

 

A trillion dollar corporation cares less about you. I mean *laughs*, look at these automated responses on this page!! It's pathetic! All about appearance but it comes off as curt. They'll do what it takes to keep you and your money, even if it means lying--a crusty corrupt capitalistic corporation at its best.

 

*hand clap* I have to give it to you though... Well done Bank of America! You made it to the top! And if it isn't obvious to anyone who reads this review how you did it (and trust me it wasn't completely honest business practices) my God are they blind like I was. Almost all top dogs will always prey upon and sacrifice the weak. 

 

Power. At all cost. Money. At all costs. 

 

Business can be a beautiful thing if you keep in mind that people are behind it and a business works for people, not for the betterment of itself.

Overall, my experience with them as a creditor has been typical, save for one aspect: their poor customer service when calling in. I was prompted to close my checking and savings accounts with them due to this issue, as the bank simply was unwilling to stand by me as a customer when I disputed a charge that I should have been compensated for based on the circumstances, and this very same issue with their service standards is now prompting me to cut all three of my cards and never use the accounts again. All I wanted done was to have all three cards on a matching billing cycle to make payments easier for me. For some strange reason, their customer service reps refused to do so. I called on various occasions during the year about it and received the same poor result-the reps refused to update my billing cycle on just one card. When I kept persisting as to why, the latest rep simply transferred me to the collections department, as if I had or was going to pay late, though the bill was not even close to being due and would assuredly be paid in full! This kind of assumption is simply sad and shows how they feel about the majority of their account holders-delinquencies waiting to happen. I promptly explained this is not a collections matter and was given more of the same run around by two other reps transferring me here and there, doing basically nothing to really solve the issue nor explaining the reasons behind why the request could not be satisfied in any way that could be described as excellent service, something I've too often heard their reps describe as their aim. Sadly, this excellent service is just puff and smoke, a dream. Asking for a simple billing cycle change is such a basic and elementary request.

Bank of America (BoA) staff mishandled and miscommunicated handlings of reimbursement of $10k+ owed to me. This involved 4 customer service representatives, two customer service managers and an AVP of customer service.

I requested reimbursement of funds mid November. I was told that I would have it within 2-5 business days to the bank account of my choosing.

9 days passed and the fund were not deposited in the designated bank account. I contact BoA and the customer service representative mentioned that I would not have it for two billing cycles because the first representative processed it incorrectly. I requested that it be fixed, as I needed fund for bills. They enrolled a manager, who then said it would be corrected and I would be have funds in 48 hours.

2 days later the funds were shown to be removed from BOA and sent somewhere but it was not in the designated bank account. I contacted the other bank a day later and they confirmed that BoA sent nothing. I emailed and called the customer service manager that was handling the matter and asked for him to confirm it went to the designated account and when I will have it. He said I should have it.

3 more days passed, I still did not have my funds from BoA in my designated bank account. I contact the manager again and he said he would look into it and ask the escalation team and get back to me but he would be able to tell me that day. So I called the customer service number and got another customer service representative and their manager to look into where my money went. They said it went to the designated account and should be there in 3 days, that the other manager did not expedite the reimbursement.

3 more days pass (20 days from my original request) and I still do not have my $10k+. I keep emailing and calling the customer service manager that was originally supposed to resolve it. After several attempts he finally emails me back and says that he's still waiting to hear from the escalation team. I ask him if he has tried to call that team, or if there is a supervisor he can get help from - I got no response.

At this point my other creditor's bills are starting to bounce. I decided to call the customer service number again because the manager was not providing the information I needed and had no sense of urgency on the matter.

Once I got a hold of another customer service representative, I explained the situation and that I had already filed 2 complaints, and that I need to speak with someone higher than the customer service manager that was not acting effectively. She went to send me right back to that same manager. I pushed to talk with someone higher. 

I finally got an AVP on the line, which told me that my funds left their bank 2 days after my second request, and was sent to a creditor other than the designated bank that BoA kept telling me on a recorded line and via email that my money would go to and went to. He said that I'd need to contact the creditor to get my funds back and that BoA did make some errors and it was a coaching opportunity for them. But basically, now they can't help me - I have to contact the creditor?!?

I look at the creditor account and no payment for $10k+ is made to my account. I call the creditor and they could not locate it off the bat. The money is in limbo. I have opened a service investigation ticket with the creditor and will not hear back for at least 2 days. In the meantime, steps I took to clean up my credit are now ruining my credit due to BoA's mis-handling/miscommunication, etc. 

This is more than a ""coaching opportunity"" for BoA. I have worked in finance for 20+ years (Credit Unions, Banks and Mortgage) and this is unacceptable.

I made a business deposit at an ATM at 3:30 yesterday. The machine froze. I called the # on the machine (REMOVED BY BBB), was on hold for about 5 minutes, and gave the machine # (REMOVED BY BBB). I explained it was a business account and business checks. The machine was rebooted. I was told that the card may eject during the re-boot process (approximately 5 minutes), and was transferred to another customer service dept. while waiting. But, the card did not eject. I waited about 10 minutes, and the machine rebooted and was back online. However, ATM customer service had already transferred me to another customer service dept, so I left, as I was now late for an appointment. The appointment was to deliver my co-worker's donations to an animal shelter, and it was closing. 


I held for about 15 -20- minutes and I was told they were personal accounts and couldn't help me and transferred me to business customer service. The menu referenced ACH and nothing else, so I held, as I was driving. This wait was also about 20 minutes. This department verified my identity, told me they only handle back end ACH claims and said they would transfer me to business customer service. I asked if I would have to go through the same process of verifying identity (I was driving, so difficult) and they said I would not, and that I would not have to verify identity, and would be directly transferred.


Of course, this did not happen. After a 40 minute wait, someone came on the line, supposedly to help. But, at this point, I just arrived at the shelter appointment. I asked them to hold, because I could not start over again.


So, this person asked for my identify to be verified again, heard the story AGAIN, and told me they would submit the claim and a complaint on my behalf. Jeannie gave me the service request #: REMOVED BY BBB and told me to call REMOVED BY BBB to follow up on both the deposit and the card. She said these claims are expedited and taken seriously. She said she could re-issue the card, but there is a $15 fee that I would just need to call and dispute. Really? No thanks. I have spent more time on BoA's faulty equipment and incompetent personnel than on my own business today.

This morning, I received an email that there is a message on my account. This message said the issue was closed, but no detail. It said to call ************** for details. I called. They said they could not help with this type of claim. I have been on hold now for 17 minutes to REMOVED BY BBB. Seriously?!?!?!


I realize BoA is a large organization and does not care at all about my business, but this is truly unbelievable. Also, that ATM is out of commission about 50% of the time and should be replaced. I cannot wait to switch to another bank as soon as I have time. I have 2 personal accounts, one for 30 years) and two business accounts that process 2.5M a year, and I realize that is small to BoA, and that no one there cares. But I am a small, woman-owned business and 24 people count on these deposits to be paid.


Still on the phone after 36 minutes and have been told that no claim was filed. **** 


Was told the card would be re-issued and that the checks would be investigated within the next few days. I said that was unacceptable and needed to happen NOW. Supposedly, it is now expedited again and I should hear back. Can't believe I actually had to ask for it to be expedited. That should have been offered up front.


I said I don't believe I will hear back and was given the deposit specialist # to call if I don't. REMOVED BY BBB We'll see. I don't have high hopes.


If I ran my business the BoA does, I would be out of business. And, I may be driven out of business by BoA not depositing my checks and taking up 5 hours of my time for a machine that they should not even have in operation. About 50-75% of the time, when I go to that location, there is a repairman working on the ATM. I have tried going into the banking center and have been told to go the machine as it is faster and in a condescending way, told how to use the machine. 


So, BoA, do you have a recommendation for a good bank that cares about their small, women-owned businesses?

December 4
Well, here we are the next day, and still no resolution, as promised.  I am on a 29-minute hold with the deposit specialist line: REMOVED BY BBB.

My personal bank said there was no such attempt to deduct a payment from Bank of America. The next day Bank of America charged my a return check fee, but could not give me a reason as to why. My personal bank account had more than enough funds for the payment and again after calling my bank they said no such attempt from Bank of America was made for the payment. 

I was told by Bank of America there was nothing they would be willing to do about the fee. They refused to take any blame or investigate why their website and iPhone app were saying payments were being accepted but then being reversed. I have no recourse of action because my personal bank has no record of the payment being attempted to be deducted from my bank account and Bank of America refuses to tell my anything other than they will charge me a fee. 

Their customer service will not tell you the truth or be knowledgeable enough to do anything other than tell you what you can see on the website yourself.

Then the next month i get a bill for 4500 dollars I called and I  asked why am I being charged this I just recently paid this and cleared the balance and THEIR EXCUSE was they are PREVIOUS CHARGES I tried to explain I haven't used my card in over 3 months and cleared the previous balance . They did not care at all nor did they try and assist me in trying to solve this issue . They are just trying to strong arm me into paying another 4500 dollars.

I called Bank of America and talked to four different representatives before a very hateful person came on the phone and basically demanded that I go to the nearest Bank of America branch (2 hours from me, so a 4 hour drive total) and verify my identity with two forms of ID. First of all, you allowed a complete stranger to change my passcode this morning! That's not MY fault. It's your security's fault.

She refused to close the account and still, even after hearing that I am severely disabled and unable to go in person to verify my identity, refused to close the account. That's terrifying. It's a simple matter of because of your allowing someone to change my passcode, someone who wasn't me, now you're saying that I have to drive 4 hours so that I can do business with you? NO THANKS.

I have been attempting to get a Power of Attorney added on my uncle's BOA account for five weeks.  I have been to two different branches (thinking that perhaps) it was just the one branch that had unprofessional employees.  Wrong.  Must be company wide.  The first individual did not take my contact information, and would neve return my voice mails.  He only completed a portion of what I needed done.  The management at that office was just as bad, and would not provide me with a payoff, so I had to wait in line twice and the second time write a check for the SIX CENT payoff. 

Now, I am struggling to get the POA taken care of again (I went to a different office) and encountered the same horrible customer service.  Again no one calls me back.  When I call the 800 number I am told that information has been mailed to me, but they can't tell me where.  When I ask to speak to a manager it does not happen.

My uncle also had an account at *********** (I'm not a customer there either) but the experience was totally professional and easy.

This should make me the ideal, responsible, trustworthy client. On August 23, 2019 I deposited a $20,000 check from ***** bank into my business account. I had been transferring money into that same ***** account for months for business, however that was the first check I had received from the same account. I asked when the funds would be available and after checking with the manager, the teller told me the funds would be available the next day. They were not. When I called to question when the funds would be available I was told it was being held by ""Risk Management."" They said none of the funds would be available until September 4rd, a full seven business days after the deposit. They said they believed the check would be returned and a letter had been sent to me stating that fact. The check cleared the payor's account and was deducted on August 26th. I waited until August 28th to call the bank again about my funds. I told them the funds from the check in question were removed from the ***** account on August 26th and I would like the hold removed and the funds put into my account. Customer service said no, they didn't have the funds yet and Risk Management would not budge, ""and by law, we can hold funds for as long as 7 to 10 days."" I asked to speak to risk management and was refused, they do not speak to customers!?! You may only communicate through customer service! Yesterday, I finally received the letter from Bank of America and it did in fact say ""A hold was placed on your check because check specific information indicates item may be returned."" I called B of A yet again and told them the check had been paid and asked why I couldn't have my money. They said that just because the money had been deducted from the ***** account didn't mean that B of A had the actual funds from the check yet and no I couldn't have the money until September 3rd, again repeating the mantra ""and by law, we can hold funds for as long as 7 to 10 days."" Frustrated, I called my daughter-in-law, a manager for ***** for over 15 years and explained what was going on. She said ""B of A is just jerking you around, of course they have the money."" She suggested I take a copy of the front and back of the check that had cleared along with a screen shot of the account showing the deduction of the check and physically go to the bank, speak with a manager, show them the proof and have them handle it. I went to B of A with proof in hand. They insisted that B of A did not have the funds and went so far as to say that I had no idea how banking works. ""The check clearing and money has to go through the Federal Reserve and they put money in a truck and drive it to the bank."" Really?? In this digital age?? I insisted (as I was told by my daughter-in-law) that when the money is deducted from one bank it goes onto the books of the other bank. They said no, ***** still has the funds and repeated the mantra ""and by law, we can hold funds for as long as 7 to 10 days."" So I went home and called ***** and relayed what B of A said about ***** deducting the funds from their clients account and still holding the money. She said that was untrue, when a check is paid the money is gone from ****** So I called Bank of America again and I was told all of the same nonsense, ""B of A does not have the funds and by law, we can hold funds for as long as 7 to 10 days."" I told her that ""the funds are not magically floating in the air, they are on SOMEONE'S books. I can't use them, the writer of the check can't use them - the money is on B of A's books and I want them in my account."" She insisted they were not on B of A's books so I asked her to send me that in writing. She said no, they had sent me a letter and that was all I would receive. I said, the letter was referencing August 23rd when they in fact didn't have the funds, it's August 29th now and everyone keeps saying that B of A doesn't have the funds and I want that in writing. Again, she refused and told me my funds would be available September 4rd no matter what.

I wanted an account separate from my primary checking because of the amount of money people were paying me for the Airlines and Tour company. This year was the first year I actively used the account. About a month after I got back from Israel I begin to get harassing phone calls from BOA in regard to the account. After it was investigated it was learned BOA set the account profile up wrong.

Without notifying me BOA closed this account without notifying me in advance took control of the funds in the account. After finally getting someone on the phone they stated they could not up date my daughters profile since she was also on the account.

Some of you may love Bank of America, for you I am happy.

I on the other hand think they are completely and utterly worthless.

After depositing my check this last Friday Saturday I wake up to see if it's cleared, it had.

This morning I wake up to find out they've pulled it back out of my account putting me in the hole quite a bit! So I call to find out what happened as I know on our companies end it's already been removed from the account.
They processed to tell me that because they've never seen me deposit a check from Wells Fargo they decided to protect themselves and put a hold on my check until September 4th which is nearly two weeks from the time I deposited it.
So needless to say the very minute I can close my account and move on to another banking facility that actually knows how to do Banking and treat people right I will do so.

So if you have a Bank of America account be forewarned that when you deposit your check days later they can remove it even after you pay bills and have automatic withdrawals coming out, sure they will refund the $35 transaction fee per bounce but that doesn't change the fact that bills will be late and fees will be assessed by those companies not too sure if they're going to be refunding ** those amounts as well.

205,DELCIO S,12/01/2020,1,"Bank of America has been the worst bank I have even encountered. They pre-approved a client of mines for an amount she didn't qualify for, setting up the client for failure, and loosing her deposit. The loan officer who was handling the file pre approved my client for an amount based on her tax returns and pay statements. She put in an offer, got her offer accepted and went through all the process. Paid for a home inspection, they made her order an appraisal and also made her get an insurance binder for the property. Everything was going smooth until it was a couple of weeks before closing. Then the nightmare and games started. They kept delaying everything, my client and my self was trying to call and email the loan officer daily. He started ignoring everyone and would not provide a concrete answer. My client then reached out to the loan processor who kept giving my client a bunch of excuses. She even said once that the underwriter called out sick and that they won't be able to give my client an answer for a few more days. It's ludicrous that a big bank like BofA has only one underwriter handling all the files. They made my client run around getting paper work that the loan officer never sent to the loan processor. When she sent in the paper work then underwriters would say they can't accept it. My client is an independent contractor and has no employer who could verify her employment and income. I would imagine that a bank would use common sense and look at the tax returns, pay statements to verify a customers employment. It got to the point that the seller of the house refused to sign any extensions because BofA was always taking forever to reply back and give us a concrete answer. We informed them that the house went back on the market and that we were way behind on the deadlines. They didn't care at all, instead of expediting the file they just kept on adding days, weeks of delays. My client sent them a letter they requested and the loan officer told my client it would take up to 5 days to review the letter. Absolutely ridiculous, why would it take 5 days to review a letter? Knowing that the file was way behind. It got to the point that my client started requesting something, either a commitment letter of a letter of denial. The loan processor kept ignoring her request and kept on asking for more paperwork which my client had already sent to them. It's almost like they figured they made a mistake and they were trying to stall things and find a way to deny the loan. After almost 3 weeks they finally decided to deny the loan saying that my client had too much debt which she does not and that they could not verify her income, which was all on paper on her tax returns. My client is so stressed out from this ordeal that she has given up the idea of buying a home and also faces loosing her deposit due to BofA's mistake. I would not wish this type of thing to happen to anyone, thus I would suggest anyone who's thinking about buying a home to stay away from BofA. They will make your life a misery.

Bank Of America has started a ""get to know your customer"" campaign. unfortunately this campaign may kill their business. 

My account was COMPLETELY FROZEN with both outgoing and incoming payments halted because they ""needed to confirm my contact information was up to date"". Contact information included my name, address, phone number and email. I was NOT alerted by BOA that my account was pending being frozen, nor when they actually froze all my funds. I had to discover my payments and ACH were not incoming or outgoing from other providers (i.e. my employer, Mortgage company, and car loan company). 

Today (8/8/2019) after waiting an hour on hold to understand what was going on, i was told my account was frozen on 8/3/2019. Again, i did NOT receive any communication from BOA (mail, email, phone, online document center,pop-up on my online account etc). In order to ""unfreeze"" my account, i had to verify (all were correct) my contact information. After verifying, the customer service rep told me my funds would not be available until the next day- meaning I do not have access to my money. The ""manager"" who i spoke to said this has been occurring often with their clients, and have had issues daily. WAKE UP CORPORATE OPERATIONS TEAM AT BANK OF AMERICA- THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE FIXED IMMEDIATELY!! 

I now have past due bills, late fees, and risk of negative notes against my credit due to this issue. i was told they will ""mail me a letter saying the account is in good standing"", which then i am responsible for sending to other providers where my account (which has plenty of funds) has bounced.

(Moved my regular activity to a different card that offered far superior rewards - BoA can't compete!)

They don't have humans attempt to notify customers before they drop a bomb on their credit score!  They further justified their actions by siting a regulation that requires them to treat all customers in the same (poor) fashion, so if they called me, they would have to call all their customers before they damaged their credit.

On the surface it's not a big issue, but the fact that it's on going and the response I am getting from ""customer service""  makes it a PROBLEM... 

This is the only credit card company we have or ever had that you have to call in the get a pay off. I was made aware of this when I paid off my first balance. The very next day I was hit with interest on a zero balance. I call the customer service line and they told me to call in to get a pay off before I pay of the balance each and every time. Well, as inconvenient as that is; having to wait on hold 10 to 20 min to get a pay off, but I digressed. 

The next time I was ready to pay off the balance I called in. as instructed. After about a 15 min wait time to talk to a live person, I told the agent I would like to get my pay off balance. She told me what it was and I immediately paid what she told me to pay. The very next day, I have interest charges on my card (smh). I called in to see why this had occurred. The reason the agent gave me was ""oh, that's just an estimate.""  

OK, let me get this straight: it's just an estimate what I see as my balance online AND it's just an estimate when I do what you tell me do, by calling in to get a PAY OFF?? REALLY?? So now I have wasted approximately an hour of my life having to call in twice just to pay off my balance... This is unacceptable Bank of America! And yes they do have the call back service, but you still have to be on stand by to wait for them to call you back. I'm trying to take away every excuse they can come up with, because these companies are good at making excuses and not so much with coming up with solutions.

The only solution they gave me was to pay off the balance on the due date every time, but something tells me that they would still hit me with interest because it's accrued daily.  Plus depending on the amount I charge, I may not be able to pay off the balance every time. I just don't know how they don't see this as an inconvenience to the consumer or if they even care. They will allow you to file a complaint. When you inquire about a follow up, they tell you that there will be no follow up. UNBELIEVABLE!

Well under the old account I had opened a savings account in which they drafted $25/month from my checking and put it into my savings and this was done do avoid monthly service fees.


We had to go into a branch where we live to get the new account opened which was not a problem.  We asked them at the branch if this would cause any problems with our savings account a the way it was setup to avoid monthly fees and we were assured it would all be moved to the new account and all would function the same.  Come April I check the savings account and see that we are being charged fees and nothing is being drafted.  I call and speak to a representative who advises that she would talk to a supervisor to see what they can do.  After a wait she gets back on and advises that we were grandfathered into the $25/month draft to prevent service fees and that they would fix it and refund the fees.

Now its June, we are still being charged monthly service fees and are now told we must comply with the new rules for the savings account.

Mind you it was never an issue until our checking account got compromised and we had to open a new one.

Some words of warning on mobile banking (please read)... On 9/11/18 I deposited a check given to me by my old tenant from his ********** account. In May 2019 I received a text from my tenant indicating that the check was redeposited. I checked in my account in Bank of America and with my bookkeeper and the check was not deposited into any of my accounts. It was no where but there was a deduction in my account in the amount of $2000. Bank of America had taken the money out of my account and returned it to my old tenant. I called them and they said ***** told them to and since the check was deposited twice they had to take it. Of course I argued and tried to find out who deposited it. They said the only person who could trace the check was the old tenant. I went to ***** who told me the same thing. I called my old tenant who luckily is a nice guy. He called his bank and they told him they didn't know and he got his money back and that was that. I called the Milford Police Department and kudos to them the officer that came to my office (******) took the information and went to BOA who said they couldn't help and then to *****. ***** said the money was deposited at 2:29 am on 5/7 into a bank account that wasn't mine. The check was made out to me and said ""FOR DEPOSIT ONLY"" on the back. ***** said the hard check took precedence over the mobile always even though it was EXPIRED and not deposited by me or into my account. The only person who could do anything about this was my old tenant who needed to file a fraud investigation that then needed to be investigated and the two of us would sign affidavits. At this date, 6/17 I am still out of $2000. My old tenant awaits paperwork from ***** that was sent in the MAIL. The check I now assume was taken out of my car where I was parked in a NYC parking lot.

To whom it may concern, 
I recently had to interact with your claims department / customer service department.  It has bee far from pleasant experience.  
I have had a Bank of America Auto loan Since 2015 and on 9/13/2018 was rear ended while sitting a light and my vehicle was totaled.  To make a long story short, I was told by Allstate on October 11th that they were paying off the vehicle and, as a result,  I did not make the October 28th payment.  
I called Bank of America on November 11th to confirm they had received the payment and they claimed they had not however Allstate confirmed the payment was sent.  
I received confirmation on Nov 27th that the loan was paid in full.  
Although the payment has now been received by Bank of America, they have chosen to list a late payment on my credit report.  December 7th my score dropped 128 points based on my Transunion report.  I called Bank of America and Allstate on Friday the 7th in a panic as I have current plans that require my credit.   Allstate apologized and also contacted Bank of America on my behalf and via a conference call with me on the line to help explain the issue.  I attempted to explain this is based on inaccurate information and was asking for Bank of America to assist me and adjust the payment history to reflect the final payment has been received and remove the only late payment on my credit history.     I spoke with Vxxxxy ........ who was rude, condescending and had a very confrontational approach.  I was shocked at the way she chose to approach the situation.  I requested her supervisor's contact information and then contacted her supervisor Cxxxxe M. on December 10th 2018 as directed.    That was also a very unpleasant experience and I am truly disappointed.  I would have gladly paid the one (1) remaining payment to not have my credit impacted this way and to treat me the way they did was completely unacceptable.  
I have contacted Bank of America through email via contact us on their website and was called back by Kxxxxa A.  She conducted herself more professional than the previous two (2) however could not do anything.  She made me feel as if my situation was unimportant and then pawned me off the best she could to get off the phone.  I asked to speak to a supervisor and apparently they do not have supervisors that you can speak to.  She instructed me to call back and ask for her supervisor Cxxxxxa H, or her supervisor's supervisor Cxxxxxa S.  All of which have the same title of supervisor and do not have direct lines, emails, or extensions.  I need to call the 800 number and ask for them?  Sounds like I am being put off.

So right away I called the bank and reopened the claim.
I was told by the Bank representative that she would re-opened the claim and she doesn`t know why was denied the first time giving all the information provided.
This time I had no response from BOA for over 60 days .

They told me my claim was closed because FTC had only issued a temporary restraining order and they needed proof that the company in question is permanently shut down.
I called both the State and the FTC leading attorneys to see what is the status on the case.
I was told that the case was close and the company was shut down for good.
I was then told to have BOA call the attorney  s  office or the FTC to confirm that information or request more information regarding the case if needed.
BOA straight up refused to do that and insisted on having an official statement that the company in question was in fact a fraudulent and is no longer operating.

317,P Baer,08/16/2013,1,"I ordered an airline ticket online. When I filled out the credit card information to finalize the purchase, I made a mistake on the expiration date. I submitted the information for purchase. 

The computer screen said the ""credit card did not go through."" Of course I didn't know why until I went back and double checked my entries. That's when I discovered my error.

However, Bank of America (BOA), immediately blocked the card. And I could not make further purchases with the card.

They give me only one chance to get the expiration date correct. After that BOA blocked the card. And they did not tell me why. All my work of putting my name and the names of my fellow passengers, our addresses, our birth dates, our TSA precheck numbers, etc., etc was lost. Airline tickets are time sensitive.. Don't have the data correct and the ticket is zeroed out.

My personal computer gives you three tries to get your password right. 

One strike and you are out with the American Express credit card. That is a ridiculous policy.  

I had to call BOA to find out why my card was blocked. Waited 15 minutes to get a person to talk to. Another 3 minutes for them to verify that I was the real owner of the card.

I received a charge from **** magazine of $75.XX yearly subscription in August, which is higher than $49 stated in its magazine. I called **** customer service to cancel the unreasonable charge right away. Due to their management transition, the customer service line couldn't locate my subscription to cancel it. Therefore I called BOA to dispute this charge. BOA asked me to upload information on line in a timely manner. I uploaded the magazine page to show the credit card charged more than the magazine stated. To my surprise, BOA denied my dispute. I called BOA customer service immediately. The customer service representative promised me no worries, the charge will be resolved. No more action is needed. To my further surprise, I received another letter from BOA shortly to ask me for more information to support the dispute within a very short time frame. I was forced to call **** magazine again and again but due to their management transition issue, I can't get a cancellation letter within 4 - 8 weeks, which is longer than BOA's window. It means I'll be forced to pay the charge before the due date to avoid a late fee. I feel BOA does nothing to help except pushing customers to provide evidence. I won't contact BOA if I can resolve the issue between me and vendor. BOA, as an intermediary between the customer and the vendor, should refuse the charge from the vendor. I told customer representatives I'm willing to pay it if it's a reasonable charge. Unfortunately **** magazine is in horrible transition and wouldn't deal well with customers. BOA should stand by the customer's side to stop the unhealthy relationship with the bad vendor so that customer can use BOA's service to build a better relationship with other vendors. I'm very disappointed that BOA just keeps asking customer providing information in a very short time frame, in more demanding ways (from upload to on line banking to Fax or mail information to its *********). BOA is getting more and more unfriendly to its customers. It's not an amount I can't afford. But I'm very unsatisfied with BOA's attitude toward customer's dispute.

324,Trying2HelpAllConsumers,02/27/2013,1,"I affirm that every word written is true.  I willingly agreed to an online credit card at checkout from a website that I was booking travel in exchange for a discount off the fair and travel incentives. The credit was approved and charged immediately.  The amount charged was $128.50.  I affirm that I never received card within the mail. I received from them mail that looked like junk mail without anything identifying them as Bank of America. All of those mails were never opened and tossed with the other junk mail.  Recently, I received a mail from them CLEARLY IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES using their NAME/LOGO stating that I owed them $256.99. I thought it to be spam until I called and became upset because I did not see any bills with a sender from Bank of America but received the collection notice with them being the sender.  Do note, at all times until I received the collection notice, that I didn't know who backed the online credit received when I was paying for my airlines ticket, nor did I know who to call, nor did I know that I was being billed because all looked like junk mail.  The matter was escalated and I agreed to pay the bill.  The manager told me that the bill was now $354.00 even from 3 months of not paying on the card.  Without hesitation, I paid the bill the same day that I received a clear NOTICE of a bill at one of their banking centers.  After I paid the bill, I was told that the account was already closed many days before I even received the mail. This puzzled me because I asked them to closed the account during the conversation, yet NO ONE TOLD ME THAT THE ACCOUNT WAS ALREADY CLOSED.  I am like wow!!!! How can they charge me late payments fees of $101.00, interest, and an additional  $97.01 dollars when they knew the account was closed.  So, in total, I was charged an additional $225.50.  I had to contact the credit bureau  to lodge a dispute after I paid the $354.00 in order to remove the late payment history.  I called back to the bank. The automated system said that I had a credit of $156.00.  I didn't need a credit on a closed account and it was $69.50 short from the $225.50 ($156.00 + $69.50 = $225).  At worse, it should have been an additional $10.50 more because the annual fee was $59.00.  My account was sealed such that I had to authorize the person to look at it after they sent me a text message. After he opened the account, his demeanor changed as he stated that he was reading the notes. I clearly stated that I was now recording the call.  I requested for  the monies owed to me to be sent to me after the bank employee confirmed that their system did not indicate that a refund was being sent out. I then asked for a  Letter of Satisfaction, which was already requested on the day the account was satisfied.  He said it be scheduled to go out.  I ask for written confirmation that the credit bureau was updated and he got short on the phone, but, said it was updated. It is MY BELIEF that it was updated ONLY because I initiated the action.  I then asked why was I charged more money on a closed account that was already sent to collection when I the consumer wasn't informed that it was closed.  He refused to answer and stayed silent the entire time .... the call held an additional 2 minutes and 12 seconds without him saying anything.  I wasn't put on hold.  I then recorded myself noting that the Bank of America employee refused to disclosed why $97.01 was added to a closed account within their collections department when the customer called to pay the balance of $256.99 .  I just wanted an explanation, even if it was, we are charging you interest for the first month and the annual credit card fee.... but, I didn't even get an explanation.  To add icing on the cake, I received on the same day of my final call with Bank of America (10-04-2018) another unidentified piece of mail from them exclusively going over late payment fees that will be charged, despite the card being closed already.  That was sent to satisfy  the CFCB on a complaint I made against them.

Either way, not only incorrectly incurred balances have occurred, but, when attempting to address the issue, the overall service has greatly diminished.

I applied for the Bank of America master card (the one with 0% apr for 15 months), and was only approved for $2,900. My old credit card had a limit of $7,000 on it, and I have always paid my bill on time, and had a good balance/credit limit ratio. Plus my fico credit score is 738. I needed at least $9,700 on the new credit card total to be able to do the full balance transfer I needed to do. I was approved for an additional $1,900 on my old BOA credit card, which allowed for everything to work perfectly. I then transferred $7,000 over to the new credit card making my credit line, $9,900, and my old credit card line was then $1,900. This showed on my account for two days, and then the $1,900 disappeared without anyone reaching out to me. I had already made the balance transfer when I was approved for the credit limit increase. Now I am left with being unable to do the full balance transfer, which was the whole point of opening on this card. I have spend a total of almost 6 hours on the phone with different representatives, I have the phone records to prove it. Most of them couldn't care less to help me or do their job.

With hundreds of thousands of customers if not millions feeding its greed with monthly maintenance fees and late charges with no one but mere pawns to utter company policy type language after ""Bank Hours"" when of course time matters the most, the machine of a business entity rolls on ignorantly avoiding responsibly bc they can with fine print, while penelizing every mishap that could be created or imagined with FEES.  How about We customers charge you a late fee.  The biggest issue I'd say is inevidable legal theft.  How can it be possible that in the 21st century the largest bank can hold a check deposited into an atm for 10 business days or more to ""verify"" it's legitimacy before clearing it for their own customer.  Most costumers have bills that are due weekly, monthly, dayly whom also have penalties for those companies if not payed on time let alone credit rating contingencies and more.  This proves that time is far more valuable than money and this particular bank seizes your check if deposited into an atm, then spits out a reciept / notice that says it will hold the check until the following month with a set date before releasing funds to your account 10 business days or more. This is the customers' money not yours! Customers are forced by availability and compliance into keeping funds at a more common bank in checking accounts in order to pay bills and conduct business transactions in some form other than cash for all types of crucial reasons. It's a domino effect and once your bank sits on their thumbs and says processing everything is left to speculation because Bank of America employees can't disclose the progression of the processing time period.  Bank of America! Stop excusing your legal theft with fine print! Make a call the following business day to the bank of record and verify the funds if you're so concerned as to the ligitimacy of any particular check deposit. DON't TAKE 2 WEEKS TO VARIFY CHECKS WHERE EVER THEY ARE DEPOSITED; WHETHER IN PERSON OR ATM!!!  THE CUSTOMERS OR ""MASSES"" OR ""NUMBERS"" IS SURELY HOW MOST OF BANK CUSTOMERS FEEL THEY ARE , HAVE BILLS TO PAY AND NONE OF US ARE GETTING RICH AS FAST AS YOUR ENDLESS FEES ARE MAKING YOUR ENTITY PER DAY MORE WEALTHY THAN IM SURE MOST COULD EVEN COMPREHEND!!!!!

My escrow account was review at the beginning of 2018.   I contacted Bank of American in January and February 2018 and was informed that I didn't have a short fall in my escrow account for 2018.  All of my obligations were paid for 2018 from my current escrow account.   The account as of today, April 12, 2018, doesn't have a short fall.  All require payment from the account will be paid.

I called Bank of American to find out why I received a letter about 2019 when we are still in 2018.  I spoke to a rep, in Phoenix, he informed me that my account was evaluated again using the projected insurance and tax amounts for 2019 and they arrived at this amount.  I asked the rep, was my current escrow account short.  He said no, the account was current.  I asked him how this assessment could be done again in this year when Bank of American has not received any bills for 2019.  

I told the rep, if I paid this amount that was cause me escrow account to have an overage and that I didn't think that was legal.  How can I be expected to pay for a 2019 escrow short fall when the bills have not been submitted to Bank of America for 2019.  The rep transferred me to a manager, and we had the same discussion.   She informed me that there was nothing she could do.  She filed a complaint for me with the bank.
This is in my view, on the situation. It is a form of extortion because I am being forced to pay a debt that has not happened.   Bank of America doesn't have any bills to pay regarding my account for 2019.  They will hold my funds and millions of other customers as an asset to make loans and draw interest to increase their profits.

When I arrived at the arena, we were told there was a huge ticket scandal(about 400 people) and they gave us a letter to give to my bank to get a refund. The letter stated the tickets were fraudulent. A few days later I send my letter the the claims department via mail, and the charge drops off. I thought I was in the clear. 2 months later, the charge is back. I take my letter to the bank and have them fax it to the claims department to ensure they receive it. They gave me the receipt of the successful fax and tell me it should be in my account soon and sorry for the inconvenience. Another month goes by and I receive ANOTHER letter saying my claim is closed because they never received proof even though it was faxed from the branch on Canton hwy. I returned to this branch and the associate I deal with is extremely rude, and basically tells me there is nothing they can do but they will stand by while I get on the phone with the claims department. After being on hold for 45 minutes, I get on the phone with a supervisor that wants the fax sent straight to him so he can make sure it's taken care of. I thought this was finally being handled. They send the fax and I'm told he will call me back tomorrow to follow up. I received another successful fax receipt. 4 days go by and I get no phone call. So I call the claim center again, they state they have no records of me calling, sending or filing anything. ALSO, the claim is now too old to be reopened. So now I am out 200 dollars because my bank can't seem to send a fax and failed to have any sort of customer service.

I enquired about mobile deposits clearance time and Bank of America's reply was 1 business day so I went ahead to deposit the check on the phone app and even a technician guided me and assured of the promptly time it would take for the funds to be realised. Next day I checked the status and the check would not be realised until 10 days later. I called technical support a few times and they say that I could either expedite or cancel the deposit if I take the original check in person to one branch but technical support is unable to cancel over the phone. Once again I trust and take Bank of America's word for granted and I showed up in person to the Hollywood Branch where an associate tells me that there is nothing they can do even if I show up with the check- all that it is done is to connect me to customer service. I wait on the phone for 16 minutes and I explained that I am at the Hollywood location but they refuse to help me and the woman on the phone refuses to cancel the deposit- then a bank manager also refuses to cancel the deposit or expedite it since I have the original check.
The check was legitimate from a good company and Bank of America's practices were misleading for there was a discrepancy of information among its members. This is unaceptable for the check should have never been put on hold for so long. Bank of America should shape up itself and it should cultivate the habit of not telling lies in order to misguide and mislead the customer.

We have a very horrible experience with BOA home loan.  Recently we have applied for a home loan from BOA.  The first contact with the loan officer did not show up the next day based on our appointment.  We did not receive any phone call or email from the loan officer.  The branch manager referred us to a different loan officer at other location.   Our loan amount is 36% of condo purchase price.  We put 64% down payment for the condo.

We have submitted all the required documents: tax return for 2015 and 2016 tax year, detail investment portfolio from two investment bankers. last two years saving and checking accounts details, annuity contract statement, credit reports, condo purchase escrow contract information, and condo buying contract.  Our credits show we are over 800 score. At the end, they still said those documents are not enough. Furthermore they want to know our spending pattern. They even question our son's property and all our 30 years residential properties history. They asked when and why we sold the properties in the past 30 years. Also, they question us why we spent $2,000 and $3,000  the two months ago.  I think BOA has violated  our privacy law and treated us like a criminal.

Unfortunately, the payment was sent to the wrong address. I contacted Bank of America, and changed the address & asked them to reissue another check. Sadly, the change was never updated and an additional check was issued to another wrong address. After communicating with the preschool, two weeks later, the checks had still not arrived. Another check was issued, this time with the correct address, but it was expected to arrive a month after the payment due date. I requested another check be mailed using overnight service & a refund of a $50 late fee was issued by the bank, since the preschool was no longer patiently waiting for their payment. The check arrived the following day, so I thought my concerns with Bank of America were resolved. Unfortunately, a week later, my online bill pay account experienced some dramatic failures. I have alerts set up on my account, to be sent to the same email address that has been active on my account since I opened it 15 years ago. The alerts are for when money is transferred into my account & when my account is overdrawn. I did not receive any of those alerts to my email. This is the first time this has ever happened. I was charged $70 for overdrawn items. After contacting Bank of America and speaking with two supervisors, they were only willing to refund one overdrawn fee, despite making false statements about the accuracy of my email address and the accuracy of the alerts set up on the accounts. They claimed that alerts that had been set up on my account for many years were not active, despite receiving one through my mobile app the morning of the dispute. I’m concerned that the overall accuracy of my account has been compromised. There unwillingness to refund the charges, when obviously strange and unaccounted for discrepancies happened, is not only disappointing and upsetting, but the lack of accountability from Bank of America is shameful. I was charged late fees for discrepancies solely related to bank errors. They claim that since the bills were paid in full, with no late fees (this time) that they were not willing to issue any further refunds.

We have had several incidents where Money was overdrafted due to processing then fixed and having to fight them for their automated crap. Due to them not giving money on direct deposits from Amazon for a day or so we would wind up missing bills. They would tell us we could do nothing but wait for them to resolve disputed charges where some reason it was rang up twice for food. We would pay a 5 dollar safe checking fee on my account not my husbands to never have to worry about overdrafts and they would still do overdrafts. We called on multiple days, sat with several physical Tellers, managers, and supervisors, and even made them get on a three way merge call with my grandmother's bank for the current check having issues through them which is one of those checks you have to buy with money and is considered cash. It is very dissatisfying that our honeymoon was cut short due to the bank being unjust and not resolving or being able to verify over the phone when they had all these simple solutions they should have been able to do without their clunky software and locks. We did talk to several other banks who said that they can do that since each bank has its own policies but most banks would have had the money resolved since its been technically 4 days now.

It's not the best, but it's not the worst either. Customer service is usually fine, it really depends on who you get. Some are great, some are not. I remember one manager telling me that I had to have a ""consular"" ID, when my country does not even have consular ID's. The manager swore they did. Perhaps he was confused with another country. He was super rude to me. That was the last straw for me. I closed my account and went to another bank that has much better service, and ATM's everywhere. Another thing is that Bank of America has very few ATM's so you will find yourself having to withdraw money at other banks, which will cost you a lot in fees.",Bank of America Savings,depositaccounts.com,male,4,False

And honestly if we could have used Bank of America without having to use tellers, we might have kept our accounts with them. Every time we went in to make a deposit or withdrawal they would ask us if we wanted to sign up for a credit card or upgrade our account or something else every time! And we would kindly decline every time. And 2 weeks later it was the same story. Can you just put a note in our account that we're not interested??? No, they didn't. Every time we went we were asked over and over again. We liked the rates we had with our savings and checking accounts. We also liked how great it was that they had locations everywhere. We had a branch close to our home and all over the city that we lived close to, so it was always accessible if we needed it.

The customer service that I received from the employee was very good. She actually called and checked on what I thought of my banking service a few weeks later.

I've been banking with them since I was 16 and haven't closed my checking account because of comfort and familiarity I suppose. My main complaint with BOA is that a few years ago, I needed a new debit card for my account that I'd had for more than ten years and was told that I had hit a ""lifetime card replacement maximum"" and would need to close the account and open a new one, which is what I did.

It is a simple click of the button. I get alerts when my accounts are low, when my card is used, or when a bill is due. It is so very convenient. The downside to Bank of America is the fees. You must know how much money you need to keep in each type of account, or else you will get fees at the end of the month. Another problem is the low interest rates on the savings account.

I have a money market, savings and a checking account. My checking account I have no complaints with, its very simple to use and the fees are non existent as long as you have a direct deposit tied to it. The savings account works well but the interest rate is so low that its almost pointless. Its basically a tenth of a percent which is unheard of nowadays. The money market has a slightly higher interest rate but there is a limit to transfers from the account, only 5 times a month and then you start incurring a fee. I believe I should be allowed to make a few more transfers but overall im ok with this limit. The app works great for bank of america and I dont have any complaints about it. The ability to deposit checks from the app is amazing and makes me feel like im in the future.

I am constantly ""in"" my app/online banking website, and there are several features I find excellent. I like the ""keep the change"" feature that transfers any cents on a debit card transaction into my savings account. The pennies do add up, and honestly I don't really miss them leaving my checking account.
Another feature I find OUTSTANDING is the online bill pay. I am able to prepay my bills and schedule when I want the money to come out of my account. It doesn't ""pend"" prior to delivery. I made a HUGE mistake in the joint account at Wells Fargo (that I share with my husband) and prepaid some online bills....scheduling them for three days in advance. By doing this I completely bounced the account! I couldn't believe it. That never happens at BOA, I know what is going out and when the money is coming out.

At this time they offered a student checking along with a student savings. To preface this, I chose Bank of America because this is where my parents were banking. Upon getting my first job, I opened up the student checking and savings. I learned that for these accounts, there were no monthly charges attached. One didn't have to keep a minimum balance in the account, nor did one have to have direct deposit in order to bypass this. Instead it was pretty simple. Fast forward a few months and a few dollars saved, I wanted to take money from my savings, and transfer to my checking. I learned that there was a certain amount of transfers between my accounts per month, or I'd be charged. At this time it wasn't an issue, as it was supposed to be a one time thing. After a few more months, I wasn't making as much, and was needing to transfer money from my accounts. I quickly surpassed my allowed amount, and began to incur monthly charges. I wasn't very fond of this, and eventually moved myself over to TD Bank. Because this isn't about TD Bank, I'll skip the jargon, and simply state that I wasn't happy with them, and moved back to Bank of America. This time I was not a student, and had to open regular type accounts. At first I didn't open a savings, because I knew the limits behind that.

Bank of America noticed that this is not usual for me and subsequently gave me a call. However, I missed this call and prompted the fraud detection in app. It allowed me to submit every fraudulent transaction and receive my money back quickly.

The year was 2012. I was unable to complete the checking account application online, and the application directed me to go to one of the bank locations. Upon arriving, I was told I could indeed get the free checking account with no monthly services fees regardless of the account balance, but that it was conditional. I had to opt into e-statements, with the understanding that if I ever went into the bank to have a teller perform any type of bank service for me, there would be a charge. Since I was having a hard time finding a totally free checking account, and since I like to do many things online anyway, I decided to try it. I was also given access to a free Merrill Lynch brokerage account. I set up the account and have gone in and picked stocks to watch, but have not purchased any. I also tried out a CD account, but soon found out that the interest was so small, it wasn't worth the time. I ended the CD and had to pay a small fee that was larger than the interest earned. That was disappointing, but bad rates on accounts accruing interest were commonplace. It wasn't exactly the banks fault. Overall, I've had a good experience.

91, Turveya,12/19/2019,5,"Bank of American Mobile Banking The thing I like about banking with Bank of America is that they have a mobile app available. But this isn't just some crummy app that you don't really use. Instead, I use it for pretty much everything, even making deposits. The app is incredibly easy to navigate which is great because I wouldn't use the app if it weren't. But my favorite thing about it is that I get to deposit my paychecks from pretty much anywhere. I get paper checks from my job, and going to the bank to deposit funds twice a month can be a bit tedious. After all, I don't think anyone enjoys waiting in line at the bank. So when I get a check, I simply log into the app, take a quick photo of each side of the check and choose which account to put it in. The funds are technically added the same business day, though you cannot access them for debit card transactions until the following day. This is especially nice because I have learned that when taking a check into the bank for deposit it takes an extra day for the funds to be added which can be really frustrating. Oh! and did I mention that you can choose to use your fingerprint to login to the account so you don't have to worry about remembering the password? I have at least 50 passwords for various sites so being able to login with the fingerprint is really awesome because it's so easy. I also noticed that earlier this week the app has made it to where you don't have to even login to view your balance. You simply open the app and hit balance. Obviously if you want more information you are going to have to login, but it's nice to be able to access balance information so quickly and easily. I only have a couple small issues with this bank. For one I don't like that every method of depositing money seems to take a different amount of time to post. You depost through the app it posts the same day but isn't available for purchases till the next. You deposit at the atm $300 is available immediately. You deposit with a person at the counter your funds won't post until the following day and won't be available to make purchases until the second day. This can be extremely confusing and it took me at least 6 months before I figured out the various rules. I mean it is my money, so it can get frustrating when you have to wait a day or even two to be able to access that money. My other issue with banking at Bank of America is that the customer service is kind of hit and miss. It seems to be based on who you happen upon. Some customer service reps are great others are awful. In fact when I have had issues with my account I have been known to get one bad customer service rep, hang up and call back, and then get a great customer service rep who is more than happy to help me out. Though even this can be frustrating because once you hang up it take a while of suffering through the automated phone line before you can reach another rep.

As for the accounts themselves, as long as you do not overdraft, there are little to no fees associated. Transactions are recorded promptly and can be made easy at ATMs, online, or in person at the bank. Interest earned on savings tends to be low. As in all banks, the major drawback in my opinion is having to deal with automated phone services if there is an issue. Eventually you can talk to an assistant, but it takes some tactful maneuvering to do so. In the case an overdraft does occur, you can sometimes explain the reasoning to a bank worker and they will credit you for it.

96, TLaw,12/16/2019,3,"Bank a 'Merica (Go Freedom!) I joined Bank of America in 2015. My old bank, Union Bank of California, closed its branch in my town, and the only other option was BOA. I hadn't heard good things about them. Friends reported that they (BOA) were impersonal, over-corporate, and indifferent in their customer service. Most of that has turned out to be untrue. In fact, their customer service has been unusually friendly, considering how awful customer service can be. I had an issue with mobile banking, for example. The woman I spoke to at the BOA service center (phone service) walked me through the problem patiently, even when I didn't have the right language to explain the problem. She explained that a default setting in my account was causing the app feature to not work (it was more complicated than that, but you get the idea), and was able to correct the snafu lickity-split. Then she asked if I was having a nice day and whether I thought the Broncos were going to win the Super Bowl (it was around Super Bowl time). I'm not a big fan of BOA's online banking system.

 Within the next three months of using the account, I did not meet the minimum deposit amount.

Some of the good features that they have is the ability to cash a check through their atm it is a really painless and simple process and now you can also cash checks from your phone.

I have 2 bank accounts. 1 with BofA that I opened when I worked for them in 1999 and last year I opened an account with SunTrust thinking that I may eventually change banks (a real pain in the ass because of BillPay/Automatic BillPay.) and move away from BofA all together. I move money back and forth between the accounts as needed... Mostly to SunTrust since my plan was to eventually make them my only bank. Without fail SunTrust will hold my funds for 3 days before I have full access to them, which has caused me so overdraw a couple of times (at a $35 charge from SunTrust), or had online BillPay refused for insufficient funds, causing me more fees and late fees from those I am trying to pay. Yes, I know that banking laws say that it ""could take up to 3 days"" for funds to move between banks. Using electronic transfer I can push money from BofA to SunTrust or can pull from BofA from SunTrust. It doesn't matter which way I do it, SunTrust doesn't make the funds available for 3 days. HOWEVER, BofA shows the funds as gone the day of the transfer. To get around this I have found that I get faster access to my money (or at least part of it) if I actually write a check to myself from BofA and deposit it into SunTrust. Even with that, SunTrust puts a hold on part of my funds, even though BofA has already sent the funds to SunTrust. How do I know? The electronic image of my check is available online at BofA the very next day. If I do the reverse and move money from SunTrust to BofA, SunTrust does not release the funds for 3 days but BofA (after verifying the funds are there) makes the money available to me same day. What do I pay for this wonderful service? At SunTrust - $7.50/month unless I run 10 transactions through the account. At BofA? $0.00 with no stipulations. Totally FREE checking. Comparing the Mobile Banking Apps BofA is great at automatically capturing my check images.

The time when we went to the bank to open an account, the person who took care of us was very helpfull and nice, to point that we haven't had any need to go back or call for information. Even when we went abroad, and in some store, they charged us three times the same amount, the Bank locked our account, as a measure of security. We liked that. And when we called the Bank, because our card was blocked, they were very helpfull giving us assitance. We like their on line programs too, very easy to access and to use.

They are so money hungry they charge you for every little unreasonable thing, and I'm not just talking about OD fees (I opted out of those and use my account wisely). If you are an unhappy customer, they dont care about anything you have to say. They'll just close your account and not even ask why you're unhappy. ONLY ONE EXAMPLE: I had missed two CC payments on ANOTHER CC UNRELATED to BOA (while I made sure to make BOA CC payments on time and more than minimum) and the CC department decided to take the liberty and lower my CC limit based on the two other late payments. WTH??? If I'm current with you and you are getting what is owed to YOU, what difference does it make? When I went in to close both my bank account and my credit card (like I needed the extra ""burden"" of another card) they didn't even bother to ask me why I wanted to close my account to try to keep my business. Maybe had they done so, it would have calmed me down and I would have stayed with them. The fact that they did not do so just goes to show that they have poor customer service and dont care a bit about the customer. My payment history on ALL of my cards, bills and payment schedules are all current, on time and never late, so the ONE time I was having financial problems with ANOTHER institution (nothing to do with BOA) they decided to cut my limit. I have plenty of ""good credit"" cards that I didnt need another one...the only reason I got this one was because it was a promo offer and for a separate business account that I hadn't used for business in awhile anyway, so it's not like it hurt me one bit to close that account. They only stabbed themselves in the foot and now will not see another hard, earned penny of mine go into their institution. My advice? Shop around. There are plenty of other big banks that would love your business and make sure you are happy (within reason) before closing a perfectly fine account.

When I went to him in person he was not helpful either. It felt like he was answering my questions, but really wasn't answering them. However, he did submit the necessary paperwork to Charles Schwab to initiate the transfer. One day I received a call from Charles Schwab that they couldn't accept third party paperwork. So I went to Bank America again to ask for an account number. Luckily, the previous Financial Advisor was moved to a different location. The new advisor was able to answer my questions and give me the information I needed, which was the account number.

I only found out about the check because the new Financial Advisor was able to give me the necessary information and I called Charles Schwab to update them. When I received the check taxes were taken out, which was different from the usual direct rollovers. As a result, I had to open an IRA account that reflected this or I would be taxed again.

The first visit to open the accounts took only about 30 minutes and I was given all the information I needed to make a decision easily regarding the specific type of accounts I wanted to open. The banker answered many questions while entering my information.    The second visit was due to an issue with the email address associated with the accounts which I discovered after registering with the bank's website.

Since I tend to travel quite a bit for work as well as pleasure, access becomes a problem with many of the smaller banks. This is generally not a problem for BoA.  Bank of America charges fees for everything however. If I happen to be somewhere where there is not a local ATM, use of another ATM results in several dollars in fees for each transaction. Credit card fees are high. Overdraft protection is available and you can link a credit card to your checking account to prevent overdraft fees. Unfortunately, if you use the overdraft protection you are charged a significant fee. If there were 2 pending transactions in your account they will transfer money to cover the first and charge a fee then transfer money to cover the second and charge another fee.  They allow mobile deposit now which is a wonderful convenience, but it takes several banking days for funds to be available. Getting an ""acceptable"" picture of a check can be challenging but otherwise the mobile deposit process is easy. Unfortunately funds are delayed in getting to my account. For my last deposit, that meant funds were not available for 6 calendar days and my account was then ""overdrawn"" when my bills were paid despite the fact that I had deposited over $2000. I was then charged overdraft fees for the account and over draft coverage fees for each transaction. This means that near the end of the month when my mortgage is due, I need to drive to the bank to deposit my check instead of using the mobile deposit feature.

Finally, I have told B of A that I do not want a particular credit card that they have pushed on me several times. They don't get it - so I avoid doing business in the branch.

171, DevonM,09/15/2020,3,"The Best is Truly The Worst to Me I was a member of Bank of America for about 3 - 4 years. Customer Service was spot on, most of the time. What I couldn't understand were the fees for every minute thing, and most of the fees were ambushes; meaning, you weren't warned before hand by the agents whom displayed such awesome customer service. This is a red flag to me. If you're smiling, I assume that you're trustworthy. But in the end it just seems like they're good at creating friendly environments for profit. There was no other bank that took $8 per month out of my account. This was for ""maintenance fees"" as they say, but I wasn't made aware of this. Then, there was a document that I read that said this fee would be removed whenever there wasn't at least 125 in my account. This wasn't made aware to me. After looking through documents of my own free will, and not after being recommended to do so, i discovered this. The bank has set a fee for just about every service that a you could think of, and in most cases wouldn't be a charge at another bank. My suggestion is go elsewhere if you want a bank that will HOLD your money, and not extort you legally, through contracts and misunderstanding. The banks name should be changed, as it gives the country a bad name.",Bank of America Personal Loans,depositaccounts.com,male,1,False

I signed up for a student checking account at that time and had a savings account along with it.

The next day, I found multiple $35 fee charges to my account due to insufficient funds.  On the bright side, I got my first CC from BOA back in December of 2012 with a $300 limit.

He would not deposit my check directly if I banked elsewhere because he would have to pay a fee. That should have told me there all I needed to know about Bank of America, but I acquiesced for his sake. When I quit him, I decided it was easier to keep the account and bank locally. In that time, I watched my account be charged for balance transfers at an exorbitant rate, charged a service fee when I didn't have two direct deposits made in the month that I was transitioning between jobs and other small fees here and there. Additionally, there was never a sense of friendliness or care on behalf of the employees. The convenience factor of the ATMs was the only reason I continued to keep the account, and in time, I decided to just close it all together. Apparently, others did the same because now B of A is no longer even located in that building and I believe no longer in that city except for an ATM.

My gripe is with the mortgage department in some invisible place where you can never speak to the same person twice. This started in July when I received a letter asking for verification of homeowner's insurance. If I had none, they would begin charging me about $2400 for coverage (about triple what I actually do pay) I promptly mailed all the information to the designated location. A month later, I received the same letter. After calling them, they said they never got the information. I then FAXED it to them. A month later, another letter! I gave them my agent's name and number for them to call for the info, which he did. A month later, the same letter! Again a call to another person and again a call to the agent. This week I received a letter telling me when they would start charging my account for the insurance. Aaaarggghhhh! This time I brought the insurance info to my local BOA branch and they FAXED it. I am now awaiting confirmation that they received it and the nightmare ends. Oh, until July when the cycle will start again.At best, they are totally incompetent.

231, vwang,06/18/2012,1,"Greedy Corporate Bank With Poor Customer Service, Focused On Profit Margins Not Their Customers I understand how difficult customer service and banking can be. In my industry, I have lots of experience working with banks and various other service industries. However, I have never, in my life, hung up on any customer service folk. At Bank of America (BofA), I've hung up on 3. Let me summarize my worst 3 experiences with this bank. 1) In 2010, I went to dinner at a Sushi Restaurant. When putting in my tip, the restaurant accidentally inputted too many numbers into the credit card till, and instead of a $45 transaction, my bill was a $45,908.54 transaction. BofA CLEARED this transaction and then spent over a week to reverse the money. At age 23, I did not have anywhere near this amount of money in my account and so I incurred, without doubt, a number of overdraft fees (this was before I finally realized a $45K+ transaction had cleared). Since it took them over a week to reverse the transaction, I was without money for a week. Furthermore, when I had called Customer Service to disput this transaction, the man on the phone asked me if I was trying to buy the restaurant. This was a serious question. Next, instead of reversing all of my overdraft fees, he only reversed half of them. I am not quite sure what his logic was here. 2) Recently, I had to write a few post-dated checks for a house rental. The rental company had deposited them all at once -- something they've done for the past few years. Every other bank would hold onto the checks and deposit the check according to the date listed. BofA cashed all checks immediately, and then started ringing in the overdraft fees. I called them again to disput this. The lady on the phone told me that BofA has no policy to cash checks according to the date listed on the check. In fact, if the check was post dated 6 months (or similarly, 3 years old or dateless), BofA would STILL clear the check. This hardly seems like a good security measure for your bank to have. Let alone a bank as big as BofA. In this instance, while the post-dated check clearing annoyed me, what upset me the most was how the customer service rep handled the issue. In summary, she had basically told me that: this wasn't her problem, it wasn't the bank's problem, and it was my problem to figure out. In fact, I believe she asked me the very question ""well, what do you want me to do? There's no way I'm reversing the overdraft fees and there's nothing else to do."" 3) BofA likes flagging the most random transactions on your account as ""fraud"" and putting a freeze on your account without warning. One or two random freezes without warning, I can understand. The bank is just trying to protect your account and is freezing your card for security measures. However, it gets extremely frustrating and annoying when this happens 4, 5, 6 times... and all, again, without warning. No email or phone call until the next day. By then, you are already aware your account has been freezed, because you were at dinner or out grocery shopping and your card was (embarassingly) declined, and you have no idea why. For these reasons, as soon as I can, I will be switching banks to one that cares about their customers before their shareholders. A company that puts their shareholders and board members before the core of their business (their customers) will, inevitably, fail, and I hope the rest of America will see this soon.",Bank of America Checking,depositaccounts.com,female,5,False

The dentist, Montano, at BioDental Studio quoted me $130 and charged me $570 for sedation. Then, while I was sedated, he drilled 10 of my teeth without even a consultation with me on a treatment plan. When I complained to B of A, they told me that I had to get an expert opinion, which I did. About a week after filing my dispute, I get a call from B of A stating that they can not ask for money back on quality of work rendered in a foreign country. Why didn't they tell me that before I went to the trouble and expense of getting an expert opinion from another dentist? Instead, I receive a letter telling me that after all, merchants have a right to get paid for services rendered. That's like adding insult to injury, which really made me mad. Never mind, that this bank is not there when you need them, but to have the galls to tell me that I should understand that after all, merchants have a right to get paid for services rendered. Are you crazy, not for purposely bilking the client from $130 quote to $570 and not for drilling my teeth without my permission. The worst part is, the fillings were done so poorly that they trap food between my teeth causing more cavities. I initially went there to get an implant, now I need two more. Four of the fillings that Montano put in have already fallen out leaving huge holes, where I use to only have sensitivity. The first implant was charged to my Chase Freedom card. When I told Chase what happened, Chase went into action. They were extremely supportive and even when I was a few days late gathering all the information from the expert witness, within one week of filing my claim, my money including transaction fee was placed back into my account and when the merchant did not respond after two billing cycles, the case was closed with all the money returned to me.

The first time was when the bank erroneously charged me a service fee for three months running that caused an NSF (they had, for three months running told me that the fee would be refunded - it hadn't). The NSF was partly my fault - I had missed accounting for one direct debit. However, instead of charging me an NSF fee for the direct debit, they honored the DD, which hit the account after four small transactions, and hit me with NSF fees on the four smaller transactions. When we questioned this, the customer service rep spoke to us as if we were worthless deadbeats (I hadn't had an NSF in the previous 25 years).  They have just done exactly the same thing again. My bad for the one NSF. Their bad for deliberately turning it into four fees. I've just scheduled all my bills to be paid Monday, and will be closing my account on Tuesday.

Yet, as any of you have ever tried to get a mortgage from them lately know, they now treat their customers and potential customers as if THEY were the crooks! We are trying to get a mortgage and have credit scores of over 800, own a home that is paid off, have solid work histories for over 30 years, pay off our credit card in full each month and only have a car payment each month. We've never filed bankruptcy or had a judgment against us. We collect rent on our paid off home and are in the process of buying another home in Florida. We put down 25% as the down payment and the Loan-to-Value ratio is only 75%. But BOA is treating us like we are trying to rob them of the $135K instead of borrowing it.

Over the majority of the years, I've experienced great customer service and highly recommended the bank to others. I have had numerous car loans, equipment loans, as well as unsecured loans. One year, I carried a 20K balance on a BOA credit card. BOA has made tons of money with me as a customer over the years!  Over the past year or so, the culture has changed from great customer service to ""let me squeeze every last dime I can out of my customer."" My first thoughts were--a sign of the times--all banks are struggling. Most recently, I learned that my automatic credit card payments were set up wrong (by me). When the days fell wrong (weekend/holiday), I was unknowingly paying a late fee those months. Looking back, this added up to almost $100 over the past year.  Then, this issue was compounded when I allowed my checking account to go into overdraft one month. I never worried about this, because my credit card provided overdraft protection. All of a sudden, I had several hundred dollars in overdraft fees because the credit card protection was apparently null & void when payment is not received by the due date. (Two day differential in this case.)  I do realize this was all my fault, but BOA of several years ago would have said ""the error was your fault, so we will charge you one instance of overdraft ($30) and credit all the overdraft fees back to you--thank you for being a customer for 20 years."" Now, customer service reps and managers have ZERO AUTHORITY to reverse unreasonable charges (or so I was told).  To the CEO--Was $200 in fees worth losing a 20 year customer? There were times in my life when BOA made well over $200 per month in interest alone from me as a customer.  Over the past month, I've switched all my banking to USAA, who seems to actually want my business. USAA's insurance and brokerage business is top notch, as I have been with them 20+ years too.

I was unhappy with their many fees, but as I always had a steady job, I didn't have too much trouble with this. Besides, I just thought many fees were the norm. However after learning of their many illegal actions and the many cases both private citizens and the US government held against them, and frustrated with the proposed $5 debit card fee, I closed my account and went to a local credit union. After I had closed my account, I had some difficulty because a paycheck was direct deposited to my old, closed account. When I called Bank of America about this, they told me the funds had not been deposited and that they could not hold them for me when they were received. Instead the funds would be sent back to my employer. Working with my HR department, I found out that the funds had actually been deposited and that the customer service representative had simply not taken the time to look it up and lied to me about it. When I called them again, they were unapologetic, refused to help me, would not send the funds to my new account, and were in general rude and unhelpful. This was not the first time a Bank of America employee gave me false information. I was assured by the branch manager that foreign currency exchange services were offered during one visit to a BoA branch.  A few days later I went backt to the same branch at the same time and spoke with the same person to deposit about $20 in Euros into my account.  On this instance though, I was informed that only paper foreign currency was accepted (despite the fact that 1 Euro and 2 Euro are only offered in coin form), and only at certain times during the day.  Thus, they were completely unable to help me with this service.  I would have liked to have been informed of that before I dragged that heavy sack of coins around with me all day.   In short, most of my experience with Bank of America was a case of trusting ignorance. When I learned the truth about their illegal practices and went with a new bank, they were unhelpful and rude to me during the transition.",Bank of America Personal Loans,depositaccounts.com,male,4,False

I just completed the loan process with Bank of America and some of the problems I faced were, No communication with me or inability for the loan specialist at Bank Of America to take messages., loan information going to an email address I never provided or used costing valuable time, in other words I never received some very important information, not making the closing date on time, this is one of the most important necessities of a mortgage purchase, this failure on Bank of America’s behalf cost me the seller paid escrow fee of 1500 dollars, the whole process was horrible and this was a little mortgage for under 50K. Bank of America had me down for five and one half percent interest, most lenders are going for four and one half percent or under Its is more involved, what happens after your loan is approved, more than likely there will be more mistakes long term, you may have to deal with, lost payments, Bank of America changing addresses without notification, poor customer communication and many more variables. I pulled out of the loan the same day the documents were ready to sign and close, remember this was after the closing deadline, Bank of America offered me 1000 dollars to change my mine, I explained all the problems I had with this loan and no employee at this branch including the manager seemed to care.. They proved how fast they could work when they were loosing my account by getting the docs in at 9:30pm in order to save the account and make the second deadline. Do yourself a favor, the odds are against you. After all I was a 25 year customer, that doesn’t mean much these days.

I had never received anything from BOA informing us that there was a issue of any type with our accounts.  BOA has my email address and they did send plenty of junk emails, they never sent me an alert via my online banking, they never mailed anything to my home, never gave us a call, nothing, nothing at all, they just closed our accounts without any regard on how this would affect us.  As the call progressed the more shocked I became.  I explained to them that we had called them in June due to my husbands debit card not working, and we were told at that time it had been reported lost or stolen, which we hadn't done and as it turns out wasn't the case at all.  Never once did they mention there was a problem with our accounts. I have now discovered that BOA had suspended my husbands debit card at that time so we would call to get the SSN issue corrected.  HELLO, does the right hand know what the left hand is doing, nope not at all, they just mailed my husband a new card and sent us on our way.

I called BofA to tell them I couldn't make all the payment, but I could make some. They told me to pay what I could and they were gonna set me up for a ""loan modification"" and it would take 7-10 days to get my ""package"" in the mail.

She then told me to STOP paying and wait for my ""package"" to arrive.   3. Waited 7 months! to get 7 papers that could have been emailed to me! I gathered up all my info and sent it back the following week.   4. 3 months later I was told that I had been denied b/c I had whited out my bank account number. Ok fine...that was my mistake.

I've been a customer of BOA since 2003. I have never received any nice perks nor have I ever experienced an extraordinary show of customer service. 2. When I was in middle school, I was set up with a checking and savings account. I was told that if my checking account had an overdraft, my savings account would cover it. Nowhere in my paperwork did it state that there would be a $20 fee. I have still to this date not found this fee in any of their terms and agreements. It's such a stereotype but there really are hidden fees. 3. Their online bill pay is not reliable. People choose to pay online because they trust that BOA will do what they are supposed to do. Instead, canceled payments have still gone through; payments have arrived late; and scheduled payments magically disappear. Their excuse is that I need to print confirmations and hold onto them for 60 days but then again, how is that convenient? 4. This branch's manager assured me that she would reverse my late fee which was as a result of their flawed online bill pay system, let me know that I would get a follow-up call in a few days; and would cancel my pending online bill payments. Instead, the late fee was still there, I never got a call, and the canceled bill payment still went through. 5. Branch managers have more authority than the customer service reps at the 1(800) number. This means that for some issues, you have to go into a branch. How convenient. 6. The customer service reps don't have the slightest clue what customer service means. I get interrupted, transferred to machines where I have to re-state my issue MULTIPLE times; talked back to; told NO NO NO; and lied to. Supposedly they document all phone calls but they don't. You cannot count on all of them to follow through or do what they say; some reps have been good but the negative overshadows those few individuals that try and do a good job. 7. Checking, savings, and CD interest rates are a joke. Do yourself a favor and open a Schwab.",Bank of America Savings,depositaccounts.com,,0,False

The employee whom I saw was reluctant to do anything and pretended to speak with someone at higher level on the phone who asked  why we were changing the name, then proceeded to ask for all kind of documentation -- which I provided. But they wanted originals, even though there were names of State officials and their phone #s to make any consultation. This employee was. They asked for papers I never heard off. I had been with them for over a year and things were going well, but this little and simple request seemed to get them out of their box.  Long story short, I proceeded to close the account to which they say , that's OK!!  This employee never even tried to keep our business with them -- which, by the way, was not bad at all.

The realization that I have little privacy with BoA and their new policy of charging three bucks for ""check imaging"" on the monthly statement is enough to make me investigate other banking opportunities, and to visit my local branch and express my distaste.

The employees at the banking locations are always helpful and kind. On the other hand, if you have to go through the customer service telephone line, those people aren't always as helpful or kind. Bank of America started allowing customers to deposit money in the form of checks or cash into ATMs, which is a good idea and something I was very excited about. I wanted to call to find out more details before I messed something up. When I talked to the customer service on the phone, the lady informed me it was as simple as inserting the check and the funds would be immediately available. That was NOT the correct information as I latter found out. There is a hold on checks that are over $100. Overall, I have had a positive experience with Bank of America.

I worked at a credit union for a year and so I understand the processes and procedures of the banking world. My first negative experience occurred when I had set up an automatic payment from my BOA checking account to my BOA credit card. I had it on auto pay and wanted to change it. So I contaced BOA and they instructed me on how to make the change thru my online banking. I did this. The day of the payment comes and they took it out TWICE, resulting in overdrawing my account. Then for every charge that hit, I incurred another $35 OD fee. I had gotten paid direct deposit that next day at midnight and all my money was absorbed for fees, with no time to work things out. I called the 1-800 number and explained my situation and they COULD NOT care less. They show no customer care. This was THEIR fault and they REFUSED to credit me back my OD fees. I went to my local branch and tried pleading my case with the asst manager who said there had been notes placed on my account not to refund the fees. So I withdrew all my money and closed my credit card. I also deposited a check at the drive thru one day recently and it was drawn on BOA. This was also $100. This should have been immidiately credited to my account. But it was placed on hold. When I saw the hold, I called the 1-800 number and they LITERALLY could NOT tell me why it was on hold. He said it was at the discretion of the teller who took the check. Now I could POSSIBLY see placing it on hold if my account had been negative or it I maybe had less than $100. But I had $3,000 in my savings there!!! Bottom line is they are inconsistent with their policies, only care about upselling you to a freakin money market, CD or savings, and they could care less about customer retention. The ONLY reason I still maintain accounts there is because I do like their online & mobile banking. But I have moved most of my money aay from BofA.

Convenience is the reason I've stayed with them. When I was in school, they had me on a no-fee student account. When I graduated, I kept the account because they didn't (and still do not) charge fees to people with monthly direct deposits. I currently live in NYC and BoA ATMs are everywhere I need them to be.  When I leave NYC two years from now, I look forward to switching to a local credit union or other bank. Below is a summary of my expierience with them. Advantages to BoA:  They have a good website, and their Portfolio funciton works really well. It's powered by the same software that powers Mint.com, so you can see all of your accounts in one place. This is really convenient. ATMs everywhere. Partnerships with overseas banks. When I was in France last summer, I was able to avoid foreign transaction fees by using my BoA card at BNP Paribas ATMs.  They sponsor a promotion where people with BoA cards get free admission to numerous museums, zoos, and aquariums. Disadvantages: Their savings account interest rates and CD rates are lower than elsewhere. I use BoA for day-to-day checking/cash withdrawals, and keep larger amounts in other banks. Many of my friends have had bad experiences with BoA charging unexpected fees. I haven't run into this because I have direct deposit, but the impression I get is that they view the customers as a resource to be exploited, and that it's gotten worse with the passage of credit reform laws. Customer service is not great. When I lost a card, they were quick to answer that.

We do our primary banking with another bank; therefore, we use BOA mainly as a savings account. We received a folded postcard from BOA notifying us that $38,000 had been withdrawn from our savings account (there was only $13,000 in the account) the notice stated that we should make a deposit within 5 business days of $25,000 to cover the overdraft and we were being charged a $35 overdraft charge. What bank would allow anyone to withdraw $38,000 from an account with total holdings of $13,000? We didn't remove anything from our savings, in fact on the day this withdrawal occurred we actually deposited funds into our savings account. We called BOA Customer Service and were given to the Check Fraud Division where we waited for 5 minutes listening to obnoxious music and while waiting for a rep from the Check Fraud Division. The representative at first said ""this was a banking error"" then she decided it wasn't and would have to be turned over to a fraud analyst.  When we asked when we would have resolution she stated the fraud analyst would call us .  We asked to speak with her manager and were put into a voice mail box and then disconnected.  We called back and got another Check Fraud Dept rep who asked if the  first rep had read us a ""disclosure of our rights"".  The first rep never said that we would be liable for any further withdrawals from the account if we did not freeze the account. We froze the account. We spent the rest of the night on the phone contacting the other financial institutions that we do business with as well as putting a fraud watch on Equifax.  The next morning we went into the BOA Banking Center Manager who said, after a cursory review of our account activity, ""it didn't happen at this bank"" but upon further investigation she determined that it indeed did happen at the local bank.  She said it was a 'keying error"". Apparently a customer came in after us and asked to have $38,000 removed from his savings and he asked for a counter check.  The bank removed $38,000 from our savings and gave him the check.   It appears that the  situation has been resolved (we will believe it when we get a statement showing that our funds have been returned to us and the $35 overdraft charge has been removed).  We firmly believe had we not persisted with the local Bank Manager BOA would never have found their error. When you are afraid that your identity has  been stolen and your accounts compromised it is very frightening indeed. Dealing with BOA Check Fraud Division compounds the fear because it is like falling into a black hole - no customer service, no follow-up, no communication, no help at all.

341, TangoinTacoma,01/11/2013,1,"Bank Of America - More Than Bad Banking...Harassment And Lies!    I was very excited to open my new checking and savings accounts through Bank of America. I had just started a job in Tacoma, wa that used B.O.A. as their bank and if I had an account there I could deposit my checks with no fees. For the first few months, I loved B.O.A. I was young and trying to start financially ""building a life"" for myself so I decided to open a credit card through B.O.A. BAD IDEA!!  I was hoping to build up good credit as I had no credit record at this point in my life.  The account's only fee mentioned was that of a single late fee if the payment was not made on time. This seemed reasonable. Over the next few months, I started to notice charges on my account that were incorrect. Each time I found one, I called B.O.A and, after long debate, they usually corrected these errors. After I charged a hospital bill to my card and the balance was closer to the limit, things got ugly. I always made my payments in full and on time. B.O.A, however, began adding more and more fees for various reasons that had NOT been part of the initial contract. Every time I contacted them, I was given an ear full of stories that NEVER gave any real explanation. If I continued to question them about this they would put me on hold for 20 minutes or longer and then disconnect the line. If this had happened once or twice, I would be willing to assume it was an accident but EVERY time??? Come on, now. I also began noticing false charges to my account supposedly made in places I had never even been. After doing the dance with B.O.A several more times over this, I finally became so fed up that I borrowed the money from a family member and paid off the account. I asked that ALL of my accounts be frozen as I knew no more charges or transactions were due to come through and I would most definitely NOT be banking with Bank of America again. I choze to freeze my accounts because a B.O.A. adviser said it would effect my credit negitively if I just closed the account right away. I confirmed this with other agentcies.  The employee I spoke with argued to the best of her ability but finally gave in, accepted the payment and froze my accounts...OR DID SHE?  Four months later, I recieved a statement in the mail. Everything looked as though no transactions had been made to my checking or savings accounts. Now, might I remind you these statements are ALWAYS seperate from the credit card statement. However, on this statement, in very small print at the bottom was a notice stating that a charge had been made to my credit card and that I had failed to make my payment on time. Funny...my card had been cut up, my checks burned...how is this possible?  I called B.O.A once again for our ritual song and dance of complete disrespect...they informed me that this had been a mistake and that they would ""take care of it right away"". WRONG! EVERY YEAR I do a credit check on my self and EVERY YEAR it shows up that B.O.A closed my account for failure to make payments on time. EVERY YEAR we argue, it gets corrected and we continue on until the next credit check. This year, 2010, I checked my credit and once again my dear friends at B.O.A have reported that my account was closed for failure to pay on time. This year's song and dance lasted for close to an hour with multiple holds and transfers to different departments ending with...care to guess?...a transfer to a closed department that disconnected the line. Thank you, Bank Of America, for the never ending nightmare of harassment and complete disrespect. See you in court.",Bank of America Savings,depositaccounts.com,male,1,False

There were times when I would overdraft and they would take my overdraft charge away at request. They made my credit card payment easy to pay by lowering my interest rate and allowing small payments to be taken out of my account each month. It wasn't until recently that we had problems. I was given a check for $250. I cashed the check and took out $50. Two days later I get a call from BOA and am told without a reason that I am no longer allowed to bank with them. They kicked me out quicker then hobo in the Trump tower. When I called to find out why they said that my the check I had cashed was from a fake account and that I was putting the bank at risk....!!! So there I was with no source of income since they pretty much told me I would have to wait up to 2 weeks to recieve the money I had in my account. Not to mention it was the end of the month meaning bills had to be paid. After I spoke to about 4 rude customer service reps who told me to just go to another bank and that they were sorry because there was nothing they could do I headed over to Chase. Now I am responsible person and my credit is decent so when I was told that I was not able to join Chase I wanted answers. Turned out BOA blacklisted me. I was and still am not able to join any bank for up to FIVE YEARS!!! I even showed proof to them that the check had no connection to me and it was given to me for graphic work I had done for a client. I made a lawsuite out of it and that is still pending because the client is no where to be found...and I am stuck with this mess.

BofA bought my home mortgage loan in May 2020 from my previous lender and from day 1 it has been THE ABSOLUTE WORST experience EVER!  First thing they did was tell me that I owed money for my escrow and that if I paid on time my mortgage would only be $1421+ and not spread out over 12 months with the mortgage being $1455+!  I hadn\u0027t even been their customer for a month at that point!  I paid the escrow through a teller who didn\u0027t know how to apply the loan to ESCROW so that was an unfortunate hurdle to cross!  Since then I have been on the phone ONCE A MONTH and at times MORE than once with hold times of 2 hours or more only to find out I was speaking to the wrong dept!  They CLAIM to be able to see prior calls but APPARENTLY they don\u0027t bother to read them because they say they can\u0027t confirm what other representatives have told me!  They ASSURE me that everything is fine and taken care of or WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF because they have ESCALATED my concerns to their supervisor!  I have requested an email or some sort of correspondence be sent to me verifying that they have indeed taken care of it but I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANYTHING! Go figure, they can send out all the NEGATIVE correspondence but heaven forbid they send out anything of a positive nature!  In the meantime, I have been threatened with late fees because they can\u0027t seem to get their act together!  Last conversation of 4 days ago with yet ANOTHER mortgage rep was the last straw, I even said that I was going to refinance because I\u0027m tired of the BS runaround and it didn\u0027t seem to faze him!  He also told me that a payment of $700 that was ALSO not applied correctly FROM JUNE 2020 was now corrected and applied to my mortgage and that he also escalated this to his manager so that it could be handled in one day rather than the 14 or 15 days it normally takes! I was lied to again because he told me that he or his manager would call me and let me know that it was taken care of but of course I am still waiting to hear something 4 days later!  In the meantime I am left to wonder whether I will be hit with a late fee because of their BS mistakes!  I feel sorry for anyone of the reps that work for such a poorly run company! I think they should all be ashamed of themselves for such shoddy UNPROFESSIONAL service!  Just waiting for my refi to go through so that I can finally say SAYONARA BofA!

I called several times and was on hold for hours upon hours all the shine being transferred from department to department with no solution. All I wanted to do was stop my automatic draft but you have to talk to a “specialist” in order to do so. I was never er able to stop my auto drafts so my financial institution reversed the payment and put a block on BoA for future drafts. I’ll never bank with them ever again.

Thru these hard times I thought thats what I could do. Well when I went to use my debt card it was locked so I called the bank I didn\u0027t think to much about it because I do have Safe BANKING. Well when i called the bank they released the funds. Well I tried to use my card again and it was locked again! This went on five times and each time they unlocked my card. On the 6th time I was angry because it was ridiculous. When I called I was put on hold for over 20 minutes and finally some lady gets on the phone and tells me that they shut down my account and told me it was a business decision on there part! I have been a Bank customer for over 11years! I was devastated everything I had was connected to this bank. Im received disability direct deposits to this bank! For them to fo this and not tell me why? Well needless to say I was not going to take this without an explanation! I wrote and called there corporate office until finally some one got back to me a lady named Devin Harris who told me that someone filed a 3000.00 claim on my account and claimed to be me! I told her that there\u0027s was no way I filed a claim. I explained to her that I applied for a loan and was approved. I have the emails and loan documents to prove it. She told me that I could go and open up another account because I may have been the victim of a scam. I had to get a new account number and everything. She saud my identity may have been compromised. I was devasted. Why didnt anyine call me from the Bank right away or tell me something when I called 6 times prior? I made a repoet to the FTC and FBI. Now Sun Credit Financial is harassing over 3000.00 they saying I defaulted on the loan. So now I dont know what to do. Then well my direct deposit from socially security goes to my old account thats supposed to be closed. I was suppos3s to wait for it to go back to socially security so they can send it back to me by mail but Bank of America kept it! They said it was part of the investigation!

Yesterday i tried to move funds over from account to account,and the mobile app stopped working....its funny how it stops working,when its time for them to get thier nsf fees.

Then when you call in and ask for a manager, they put you on the phone with another associate sittingin the next cubicle, thats how they did me today,11/10/20,Texas location, then again i dont know if it was Texas cause they lie so much about thier names and bs numbers. I know cause the lady i talked to today,used the same number as someone else that was a man,the last time i talked to someone, with the same number. The same thing happened to me last weekend thier app mysteriously stopped working.  A good smile and a nice hello is out dated,now a days,we need businesses to deliver, the product they are advertising.

Mind you she was totally rude and didn\u0027t offer any help or other information. That was two months ago - I mailed the copy of the check to my third party whose name was also on the check.

102,Ashur Khan,06/03/2020,1,"FraudOn June 8th, 2020 there were two unauthorized charges on my Bank of America account. One charge was for $57.55 from MenuStar, a company that doesn\u0027t even service my area, and the other was from DoorDash for a restaurant named Buona, where I\u0027ve never eaten in my life, for $36.12. I called the company within a couple of days, and by June 9th, there was a credit on my account for these two charges and a fraud investigation had been started. My card was canceled and a new card was sent out to me. On July 8th, 2020 the credits were reversed. The company sent me a letter telling me that the orders from these services came from my device and that they match my previous account activity. I reached out to DoorDash who confirmed this was fraud, and they refunded me $36.12. I also contacted MenuStar who confirmed that the transaction was fraud, but all they need is for BOA to reach out to them notifying them that a fraud claim was submitted. The bank doesn\u0027t want to contact the vendor for some reason, and therefore I\u0027m stuck with the amount of $57.55. I am still in possession of the card that was used, so I was not negligent in any way. Somehow these criminals got a hold of my card, and I don\u0027t want to finance their food or lifestyle.

117,Deb,04/12/2013,1,"Beware of how BOA calculates loan payoffs and be prepared to wait for hours on the phoneWe recently refinanced our former Bank of America loan with a new lender.  It is customary for the payoff amount to include the per diem interest for the current month through the day of closing and an additional 3 days of interest for the refinance rescission period.  In our case 24 days of interest should have been charged as part of our payoff because we closed on 9/21.  Instead Bank of America charged us interest through 10/2, and, although I caught the mistake before we closed the refinance loan, the closing attorney said we had to take it up with Bank of America after the closing.  That is where the problem gets worse.\n\nThey do not answer their customer service phone number unless you stay on the line and wait for hours listening to music. The ridiculous phone menu repeats itself and makes it very difficult to speak to a human being.  And then once you get someone on the phone, they find ways to disconnect the call, and you are back to square one.  On my fourth phone call (after being on Muzak hold for over two hours), I asked the customer service representative to please jot down my phone number in case we got disconnected.  She said should could not do that and promised she would stay on the line.  Of course, we got disconnected as soon as she had to put me on hold to ask someone else my two very basic questions.  I also spent over a week and half trying to use their secure email function and never got a response until today, a week and a half later.  The email response spent more time apologizing for their poor customer service than it did answering my questions; instead, I got a canned statement about my query being sent to their team for further research and that would take another ten days.\n\nThe bottom line is we were overcharged hundreds of dollars on our mortgage loan payoff and I am finding it impossible to get an answer on when we can expect to receive our money back or even an acknowledgement that they owe the difference. In addition, it will take them 14 - 21 to refund my $5k escrow balance.  Why?  They could easily transfer our escrow balance to our checking account; they have confirmed receiving our full payoff a week ago. But no, it will take several more weeks for BOA to return our escrow fund even though we need those funds to pay our property taxes that are coming due soon.\n\nIn my opinion, BOA is making money on our funds and the stalling techniques employed are nothing more than terrible customer service layered on top of unethical practices.

You may want to look closely to your account.  I did not receive notice of the late fee and returned ACH.  The issue is entirely with BOA.  My payments are paid automatically on the 1st of the month.  I had well over enough funds in the account to pay the mortgage.  They then ran the payment request on the 3rd of the month.  BOA has a 15-day grace period for mortgages which I have never used.  So even if there were not funds in the account (which there was) I would still fall under the grace period.  This is Day 2 I have been holding and transferred to two departments so far.  There are long wait times due to the overwhelming customer service issues caused by their system update.  In addition, the customer service employees can only give you their first names and are unable to provide last names or employee IDs.  So as the last person I spoke with said their manager agreed the charges should be waived but their department did not have the authority to waive the fees the problem BOA created.\nTo say I am disappointed is an understatement.

UNFORTUNATELY, THAT IS ALL TO COMMON! I also grew up in a tremendous amount of pain. (That continues to this day). Taking almost two decades before finally finding out that I had arthritis. Eventually was diagnosed with two forms of arthritis, fibromyalgia, sacroiliitis, spinal stenosis, and major migraines. After years and years of dealing with doctors who told me it was in my head. Telling my parents, I was looking for attention, when I would say I couldn\u0027t go outside and play because my knees hurt really bad. Or it was just growing pains. I now, support many people in their life with chronic pain. Because unless you live with it, it\u0027s very hard to understand. And have compassion. Because most people get tired of hearing you complain about the pain. So you, eventually, learn to bite your tongue and just plaster a smile on your face and just tell everybody you\u0027re fine. So long ago between my chronic pain, and having a daughter with autism (which was extremely rare back then because it was mainly found in boys.) I\u0027ve learned that I\u0027ve gone through difficult, decades of all that. So that, I\u0027m able to help others get through the same things in life.

I went online to set up his account and was unable to do so because my son is 17! I set an appointment for 1:00 to meet with a banker I got there about 1:05 let the teller know that I was there for my appointment she states that the banker that I am meeting with is on lunch! So I ask if I need to see a banker to make deposit to my account and request a new debit card(the card that was mailed to me never arrived). I was told yes. So I then ask the same MANAGER if it was ok that I had a 1:00 appointment and the banker was on lunch until 1:30? She then asked me if I was there at 1? No I was about 5 minutes late but if you are not here at exactly 1 then no appointment? She states there is a 15 minute grace period. So, the banker comes back from lunch I hear the manager tell her what I am trying to do and the manager tells me I can go in. The banker then looks at me and says how can I help you? Me: she didn’t tell you? So then she “confirms” what I want to do and then says I don’t have a cash drawer. Okayyyyyyyy, why do you need a cash drawer? Well I can’t take cash to deposit you will have to go to the counter for that. I started at the counter why didn’t she say I can take your deposit but you will have to see the banker to get a new card. No respect for my time at all.

When I inquired as to the difference between the previously torn down location (where I have done it in the past) to this new location. She stated \u0022well, you wouldnt be able to understand unless you work here.\u0022 Now, I have 3 degrees, so I feel like I should be able to wrap my head around what is so different. I later spoke to Angela, who very easily explained the situation, that they have all been displaced from their home banks and their access is linked to their home bank, see not that hard.

Reading all of the other disgusted customer reviews only confirms the suspicion that BoA seems to operate by giving their customers the same treatment.\n\nI purchased a flight/hotel bundle with Expedia back in January, and I made sure to buy the vacation cancellation waiver along with it. When Covid really hit the U.S. hard in early March, I decided to use it to cancel my trip. After many headache-inducing hours on Expedia\u0027s virtual chat, I was able to get the entire refund applied minus the $70 cancellation waiver. \n\nThe hotel refund processed right away. But getting my flight tickets from Alaska Airlines refunded was more cumbersome. I contacted BoA for support and they recommended that I send in a written explanation of the issue along with whatever documentation of the purchase to convince them that I was due a refund. This seemed like an inefficient and antiquated way of handling what seemed a routine customer service issue, but I complied because I wasn\u0027t paying for a trip that I didn\u0027t take! I submitted a 10-page application with all the required documentation and 6 weeks later, I finally received a refund. Case closed, I thought at the time! With everything else happening in life, not being out almost $800 seemed like a big relief.\n\nYet five weeks later, I checked my online BoA account to see that the full amount for the flight tickets appeared back in my account again, inexplicably. I figured another phone call or two might readily fix the problem. Clearly, I underestimated BoA\u0027s ineptitude and unwillingness to help its customers. Like many others, I spent hours on the phone, being transferred from one department to another. I was cycled through Jasmine, Amber, Randy, Manar, and Shontae. I explained my situation to each person, but was then either placed on hold, hung up on, or transferred to another person in the wrong department. No one could help.\n\nLater today I got a letter from BoA telling me that they \u0022could not further investigate my claim.\u0022 The letter did include a mention of consumer protections, but that was empty lip service. Whomever took a cursory glance over my claim did me the favor of taking a screenshot of Alaska’s refund policies, which I had already read and reviewed. Yes, you can apply a vacation waiver to nonrefundable tickets purchased on Expedia, per Kristian, an Expedia customer service rep who helped process my refund.\n\nRealizing that BoA would be of no help, I contacted Alaska Airlines. After explaining the situation to Barry in the refunds department, he advocated on my behalf with the claims department at Alaska and informed me that they would refund the full flight amount back to my BoA card. Incredible. 20 minutes on the phone with one person who works for the vendor requesting payment got me more \u0022consumer protection\u0022 than 3 hours, a half a dozen people on the phone, and 10-pages of written documentation for BoA.

On 3/19/2020 I was a victim of fraud and my account was compromised by someone that I thought was a reputable Company offering me a loan during these troubled times that America is going through. Instead of getting a loan I had all the money I had in the bank stolen and sent out through Zelle and sent to a person that I have no idea of whom they are. I was informed of the fraud by the BOA risk team as they were informing me that they have decided to no longer do business with me. What exactly did I do wrong???? I’m not only in shock by what just happened with the theft of all the money I have at this point but also in how I was treated as a criminal by the bank I’ve been with and been faithful to for years. The next day I call to try and get a resolution when I was told to go into the local bank that I set up the account in so no real help through the hours I was on the phone. I go to the local branch here in Killeen, TX where I reside and although everyone there was super nice and concerned were not able to help me either. I was basically told that my accounts were being shut down and the money that was remaining in the accounts had been frozen. I have ONLY $8.00 to my name and no assistant to get anymore money and I was told there was nothing that could be done. Why would a Bank that I’ve been with for this many years do me like this in my time of serious need???? I literally have nothing at this point.

And then another fee that he had to add because some payment process.by the time he was done it was almost 3000dollars and the 3 plus 37 cents. So I ask what happened to the money that I was paying on the balance. It does not matter that you paid.

349,Dee,01/08/2013,1,"The Most Important Review I’ll Write TodayBank of America is a fundamentally dishonest company. Today many financial industries’ business model is to prey on economically disadvantaged people, but BoA is one of the worst, and time after time, always for a different reason, I personally get to experience it. They hide fees in massive contracts, and implement them without mercy. They place holds on checks indiscriminately, regardless of amount or from where it came, and don’t bother with the inexplicably long hold time, and barely competent, surly attitude the call-room rep will inflict on you, because they will not be able to give you a reason for the hold, or an approximation of when they funds they seized will become available. This has been the case EVERY TIME they’ve “held” a check, and every time, they’ve been wrong. They’ve lied to me about when fees will occur and what those fees will be. Their customer support center ALWAYS, without a single exception has “unusual call volume” (Imagine my shock.) When the best a bank can do is not to technically break the law as they take as much of your money as possible, or “place a hold on your account” ie to borrow as much of your money, at anytime, for any reason, without interest or even your consent, that’s despicable. When the best they can offer a customer is a scripted, meaningless apology for constant mistakes resulting from unchanging, dishonest behavior, it’s safe to say this is a company to be avoided at any and all costs.",Bank of America Checking,trustpilot.com,female,3,False

358,JP Garces-Voisenat,07/12/2012,1,"Only for very rich peopleI started as a Fleet customer back in 2000. It was a great regional bank that was unfortunately absorbed by Bank of America. The level of customer service of BofA got increasingly more deficient with the years, to the point of being reduced to a minimal expression today. The waiting times in their mandatory transaction telephone lines are appalling. Some three years ago, when my checking account balance was more than 50K, due to my level of savings, they practically forced me to change to an interest-bearing account, arguing that I was \u0022losing money\u0022. On average, they paid me a meagre interest of about 3 cents on 30K. They always addressed me opportunistically as their \u0022most valued customer\u0022 (no wonder because they profited tremendously from my money balances). In recent months my money balances fell sharply to amounts well below 10K because I became unemployed. Instead of transferring me to my old non-interest-bearing account, they suddenly decided to start charging me a monthly service fee of 25 dollars. It is absolutely ludicrous! They have charged me in one month like 200 times more than all the accumulated interest they gave me. Outraged as I am, I have decided to close my bank account. But it was not enough to go personally to a branch to do the whole operation. They gave me one of their special numbers (which was constantly busy) to do another operation to close my credit card and travel card. I had to find another number online. I called and after waiting for half an hour on the line, the associate asked me how could he provide me an “excellent service”. I stated my purpose and he told me to “call tomorrow” because the people in charge had left for the day. This Texas operator told me that their time was only until 10pm Eastern time.

While I expected a hold of some of the funds, I did not expect a hold on all $5,000. I have deposited personal checks at the same ATM and the funds were immediately released. According to FDIC policies, this practice is against federal law. My guess is that Bank of America holds the funds in order to gain interest. It does not take 12 days to verify a cashier\u0027s check. With today\u0027s technology, it\u0027s just a matter of either calling the issuer or using the database to search for the amount. I do not recommend Bank of America. How is it that a financial institution insured by the FDIC holds funds from another FDIC institution for an extended length of time.

373,Christina Helm,05/06/2020,1,"Elder Abuse at its FinestAge can be a cruel partner, especially when dealing with Bank Of America. Is there a Support of Elder Abuse clause written in the handbook for aspiring employees? \n\nI have had to endure the endless avenues of deception that seem to be common practice in deflecting responsibility in the banks wrongdoing. I am not even sure where to start, the list is as long Tolstoy’s War and peace has pages, or the last two years of my life (this started in April 2017). \n\nSo i think a few characteristic excerpts will give you a fine idea… \n\nMy Mother, suffering the devastating loss of her husband (who managed the household and all the bills) and rendered incapable of making any sort of financial decisions due to the advanced stage of Dementia and a brain tumor had all of her Social Security Monies stolen via fraudulently written checks.  \n\nAs I awaited for doctors letters to activate my POA, My mothers checks were stolen and I went into the bank and asked them to freeze her account, not to take out money, not to see a balance just to report that I knew there was Fraud being committed and the monies that were disappearing was all my mothers Social Security Benefits.   I met with two different Bank executives, both of which did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!!  \n\nI was ignored, my report ignored and the fraudulent abuse went on depleting the remaining funds of a dying woman. Later on it became clear that Bank of America is a band of unethical thieves, with zero accountability and for the most part supported an evil act of Elder Abuse.  \n\nAnd this my friends is when the fun really started. BOA clearly had no intention of paying my claim, hearing the facts or acknowledging their mistake, they played it off on another departments lack of responsibility and was kicked down the hallway to yet another department, over and over.\n\nIt doesn’t take much to understand that there is a certain technique of avoidance to wear the violated customer down. I had to prove my eligibility of being a POA, then as a Trustee, which they would not accept because they wanted me to Probate the Estate which under California Probate Code #13100 - 13115, there was no need for that.  I then sent medical records that stated that my mother was incapacitated for 5 years, her brain surgeon noted that she had been unable to deal with finances or write checks for this whole time period.   BofA, then said it was her signature, on dates that she was in the hospital having brain surgery…  Shall we all just let that sink in.  In order to send BofA these documents you need to fax them not email.  In the 21st century… email still sounds futuristic in the halls of the mighty BOA. \n\nThey take 48hours to be logged and acknowledged. When checking in to make sure that the fax had been received in the appropriate department they could not be located and the request to resend the 100 plus page document was repeated (4 times). \n\n…Well, how often can one fax a telephone book without growing resentful?\n\nI have asked for accounting and statements, which has been ignored repeatedly.  I cannot tell you how disgusting BofA is to harm an incapacitated human living her desolate without money and never even attempting to get to the bottom of the claim - on a different note the perpetrators are being prosecuted for this crime - the police seemed to figure it out, but still BofA is in denial.",Bank of America Personal Loans,trustpilot.com,female,1,False

This required me to have a monthly call with BoA to get them to refund the fees and each time I was told that it would not happen in the future but that it is the \u0022systems call\u0022 whether or not changes and fees are issued; in other words, you will be charged a fee regardless of whether or not your account meets the minimum requirements for the fees to be waived. It seems that the \u0022system\u0022 does this simply to be an inconvenience to you - each time I called the BoA customer service I have had to wait 15+ minutes on the phone and the callback feature does not work often either. \n\nI also have a Small Business Account with BoA; again, it more than meets the minimum requirements for all fees to be waived, yet each month I am charged a fee which I have to call to get reimbursed. I have made in-person meetings at my local branch, and while the agents have been very helpful, it seems that they don\u0027t entirely know how the BoA system works. This is surprising as they were unable to answer some of my basic questions, including why the system charges fees when the account is above the threshold. \n\nOverall, after 8+ years I have had enough of poor customer service where each agent says something different and seemingly no one understands how the system works and I have had enough of a broken system that charges its users fees regardless of whether or not they meet the threshold for the fees to be waived.

Today I went into my nearest branch after I spent almost two hours on the phone trying to resolve a problem with a transfer that didn\u0027t go through.  I guess I was crazy to think that by going to the branch office they would help me.  What I found was NO CUSTOMER SERVICE at all.  A BOA employee could not even take me into an office to hear my problem; she kept me out in the lobby in front of other customers asking why I was there.  When I told her, she said she could not help me and that all she could do was take me to an office and dial a number for me.  I asked if she could stay with me until I reached the proper person, and she so much as said it would be a waste of her time.

However if you ever actually get money on the card from a dead beat parent, that is issued through bofa on contract with AZ state child support, you’re screwed. So finally there’s $80 to use and tried to pump gas with only $20 of it and not only does it decline but it then empties all the funds and holds it to make interest profits from your money for 72 hours before putting the money back on the card even though I cancelled the fuel purchase, it still drained the card for the next 3-4 days!!!!\nThen when ya call them to request someone with authority to remedy not only do you get the lamest excuse ever and a run around answer that if I were to go back to the gas station and if I could even talk the agent there into signing a statement saying the purchase was cancelled and get them to print proof then run somewhere else to fax that and a few other requirements they lost me on then maybe it could get replenished a day sooner??? Holy crap man WTH!!!!!??? And then when you ask to speak to someone that’s for real in charge they put you on hold for 20 minutes and then hang up on you and of course don’t call back so you get to run through their automation nation garbage all over from the beginning again. Or you can just bend over and wait which is their expectation. They should have to replace your funds with whatever interest rates they gain on your funds in that time period because there is no excuse to hold every penny on that card or $80 of it for 3 days on a cancelled $20 purchase of any kind gas or not. All that with no warning.\nHELLO BOFA THATS CALLED THEFT.\nBetween BofA, chase and Wells Fargo I’ve never understood how their corporate mission mentality is, “welcome to most banks where we go out of our way to make banking with us as jammed up and difficult as possible, where we will stick it to you any and every chance we can get, where we don’t care who’s fault it is we’ll still stick it to you somehow and just hang up on ya when ya catch on to our extremely unforgiving, one way, greedy, profit only practices.

Shame on the 3rd largest bank in US for being so cheap that they continue to limit the staff, locations, and branches that have agents in house to assist. It is obvious that BoA would prefer customers to do everything online, without assistance.

And it keeps on and on with the unbelievable stuff happening.\n\nLast week match.com charged my card for the 3rd months after i try cancelling on the 2nd month and they charged it regardless. Then i called the bank but the bank just was on the phone but didnt do anything to stop the charges. The 3rd time match.com charged again i called them and the bank tellers were telling me that i complaint too much and because of that my account will b closed. \n\nI said to those tellers ( 3 of them because i had to hang up and talk to someone else when the first social case answered me). I said clearly:\u0022 i did not authorise you or any teller or this bank at no point to close my account based of your judgement. You are my bank. Do your job and do not make decisions for me based on your like and dislike of my complaint level. You are soooo unprofessional, arrogant and incorrect. How dare are you negating my experience and how you think you are doing your job as a bank.\u0022. I felt so mad and disrespected by this bank and its no good tellers that answered my app call. \n\nNO GOOD when it comes to getting phone help. It really feels like someone when to a mental hospital and said:\u0022 u look well!  You look well! Come with me! You are hired! Nothing wrong with being sick. If you are you are. Get well. Dont attack my life and my being through a bank system. You truly no good who ever you are.\n\nI cannot begin to tell the amount of unbelievable comments these tellers think they can tell to the customers or may be just me. It has to be. This cannot be a business here! If they do what i experienced to everyone for real this bank would no be operating a year total. And its been around so im assuming this is specially targeted to me.\n\nI explained to teller what i authorized you was to get me back my money someone try to steal by telling me something and doing something else. It s not a contract but a trial. I tried i didnt like. Willingly paid a month, camcelled and then keep 1month, 2 months charging so no! \n\nThese tellers were definitely not normal people. They were so professionally off. They had no idea  how to professionalky help a customer. The 3rd one was literally acting like a kid repeating something on top of me like i win you loose game you play with a five years old and being overtalked. I m thinking in the back of my head: \u0022Who the hell hired and trained the 1st and 3rd person i spoke to?\u0022 \n\nThe 1st and 2nd phone rep definitely should be fired and not work in customer servive. The 3rd one was confirming agressively that he will close my account for complaining.  \n\nDid they even listen to themselves to be threatening a customer to close their account because they have complained 1, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 he counted over the phone!!! Are you kidding me??? I regretted right at that moment using this bank for a decade and running my cards with them for 2500 to 5000 a month in small transactions.\n\nWho says such thing to your customer even if someone tells u to say it, u should not. And i surely will not be quiet just because u want me to not talk about a thief of my money or fear complaining because you may close my account. \u0022I will sue you if you do\u0022 was what i said to this 3rd aggressive and disrespectful teller and all the other 2. Im even wondering if you are working with the thieves im complaining about. Is there a back end transaction stealing program by reps or the bank at this bank of america. You surely are not acting normal at all about my money being taken by a merchant. Whom even if u think i complained i ve called the bank twice for it already so it should have been stopped first time. Are you facilitating the subscription robery now! Why else would u act as such. Are you a rep for the bank who should represent the customer but clearly you were not and seem to defend the merchant who took my money 3rd times without stopping! So i complaint to bank to return my charge the 2nd time but they let the 3rd charge happen. Now i think even more this is on purpose.\n \nIf i wasn\u0027t clear before im clear by calling and complaining of the charge the 3rd time. Why the 3rd charge after a 2nd complaint? Was your job to ignore my complaints!?\n\n In the meantime i work very hard. I have no one who helps me and you want to take my hard working money and sush me. No BOA. \n\nSo fast foward i received a voicemail threat to attack my social AFTER THAT 3RD TELLER CRAZY INTER ACTION and few days later some dude Devin from Newark Delaware answer my call after the bank said to call from my bank of america  app. ( same name as the yelp dude who call me that morning too. They also use the code BOA. How they steal my business mony taking from my account to yelp advertising to advertise my business and steal the leads).  This dude was acting like he was trying to see how naive i was or not. He seemed to be doing something he wasnt supposed to. He was like this call is recorded and then was worried someone else was listening to our conversation. Its recorded you said. Someonevwill listen to it!  Why would you worry someones hearing what your disrespectful judgemental and crazym saying to me??? You know you are crossing your boundaries beyong and not doing what you are supp He said a check was deposited.  ts not me but its supposed to be my fiancee. But i dont take checks. Just wire transfer. So there its a lie. Basically they were doing what they said the following week. Closing your account for not doing their jobs and me complaining when they didnt. Reminder i used them for over a decade and never did them wrong. Out of all those year, they disrespect you for 8 uber complaints ( we all know how uber doesnt show sometimes and mess ur money up). There were 8 complaints she said out of 8000 times of using my card and $900 a month uber. Do you even know math as a banker? Aparrently not! Your focus and disrespect show it.\n\nIm a business owner. I made something great but crooks in Newark NJ wanted it. I said no. They send men to seduce me so they can access the bank assets and i rip their heart out each time and feed it to the evil queen alter ego of mine and send them back to the darkness they come from lol. Now the question is the disciple they have when doing shady violations in bank do i eat their hearts out too? Are they complices or just innocent people being duped by these newark delaware people trying to steal my stuff?  This is the big question👸 Ill find out soon. Those tellers were not normal. They were sooo off and saying things a bank doesnt say but people who work for 3rd party would. Its like when the nigerian scammers call to intimidate you about your information. Its stupid.\n\nThey think i dont know whats going on. I ride with the happening to see where it goes and determine the source of the problem. Few people in Deleware and Newark who have the nerve to try claiming what i made, designed and created from scratch working 19hrs a day for decades, paying for school, bills and holding 2 jobs was also what i did to be able to make my company until it comes to life. And now these lazy bratzs dare to want to scoop the benefits. If you think messing with my bank account or having uncompetent or crazy people in a bank will help you access my assets be sure i will sue u til the end of time and drag u to the mud newark. Why? because its mine. Not yours. Its my make, my idea, my compay and my money. I dont care what trick u try to use to get a hold of my things but know when u do ill roar and its going to be fierce. \n\nDevin from deleware your bank you work for and who ever just violated the human rights i did not authorize you to touch my account or to do the things you try on it. I have told you multiple time outloud over the pgone when u were acting all crazy about clising my account as those 3 morons tellers said you guys will do not to. I dont know who you think you are or who you think you are dealing with but im very on top of whats do e to me. When you are doing something if you dont want your tricks revealed do not do them to me. Period.\n\nSo bank of america theatens its correct customers that is witch hunted by a group who do not like them or envy them for whatever reason( my case is arrogant and jaleous bratzs who want what i made and i wont give it to them ever) and they have corrupted workers in the company  associating with those who dont like your being or want to control it and you dont let them ( they suck and u cant let suck run you. Look where it leads and thats with damage control) violate your privacy or run a program that includes shutting down your bank account because they want to limit you from accessing your own infrastructure you designed and they want to have and if you dont give it to them they ll still it. Hard no!\n\nWell this is the wrong person. Everything is clear and step by step demonstrable. I keep receipts and my name is Karma.  \n\nYou just been swished. I m coming for you the group of arrogant corrupted disgraceful lying cheating fake reps ( playing pshycologist when i did not authorize your doctor evaluation or hire you for medical reasons.

All my payments do not benefit investors but solely create a handsome income for BOA. \n\nBOA also uses services from a well-known document foregery facility Black Knight  who helps BOA to defraud borrowers. \n\nIn my situation Black Knight ordered a Map from FEMA to place bogus flood insurance on my property which not in the Flood zone (I suspect this insurance was result of kickbacks)\n\nLater Black Knight sent to fake \u0022Servicer\u0022 PennyMac a pile of my closing documents with a copy of my Promissory Note and a poorly forged Allonge signed by some Collateral Shipper Jordan Lune who assigned my loan to Caliber on the same closing day; and whose electronic signature is a text-book evidence of modern robo-signing and forgery.\n\nNeither Caliber or PennyMac never had any of my loan documents and never processed any payments. They merely got a password to Black Knight database (known as \u0022boarding\u0022) and posed as \u0022Servicers\u0022 to defraud borrowers about who is a real party who collects payments - BOA.\n\nAnyone who knows about foreclosure litigation and securitization of residential debt knows that the only way the banks could succeed is if they had a central repository and central command center from which all documents were fabricated and all instructions were issued.\n\nFor nearly all loans the central command was Lender Processing Systems, aided by DOCX. While DOCX is technically defunct and Loraine Brown went to jail taking one for the team, the functions of LPS remained the same.\n\nLPS changed its name to Black Knight and in a PR coup transformed itself into the publisher of what is largely viewed as comprehensive data on mortgage lending and foreclosures.\n\nHence it went from the purveyor of false, fraudulent, forged documentation to the purveyor of data perceived as reliable and thence became a trusted source whose data is considered worthy of legal presumptions.\n\nSystems at LPS/Black Knight include data processing on virtually all residential loans subject to claims of securitization many of which are represented by data on the MERS Platform which is a workaround to hide separate split transfers of the debt, the note and the mortgage or deed of trust.\n\nThe systems on LPS/Black Knight are designed for the the express purpose of presenting consistent data in foreclosure claims. As such it also enables the rotation of apparent servicers, none of whom perform bookkeeping functions even if some of them interact with borrowers as if they were actually the servicers.\n\nThe rotation of servicers comes with the false representation and illusion of boarding in which the process is falsely represented as meaning that the new servicer inspected, audited, reviewed and input the data into their own system. None of that occurred. Instead the new servicer merely gained access to the same LPS system as the last servicer with a new login and password.\n\nAll evidence shows that the functions for fabricated, forging and robosigning documents continue to be performed under the direction of LPS/Black Knight which receives all instructions from various investment banks who have each started their own securitization scheme masking apparent trades in the secondary market for loans and trades in the shadow banking market where “private contracts” are regularly traded without any securities regulation.\n\nFar from dropping their connection with LPS/DOCX the major banks have completely embraced this central repository of all loan data, all of which is subject to manual and algorithmic manipulation to suit the needs of the banks; thus they produce a report that creates the illusion of credibility, reliability and even independence even though none of those things are true.\n\nSo now U.S. Bank is further embracing LPS/Black Knight technology in the form of “Empower” for loan originations. U.S. bank is of course the major player whose name is used in foreclosures despite the fact that it has no interest in the loans and does not receive one cent from foreclosure sales of property. It merely receives a royalty for the use of its name as part of a fictitious name of a nonexistent trust which is falsely represented to have engaged in a transaction in which the trust acquired the debt, note and mortgage on multiple loans.\n\nThis deal furthers the PR myth. It strengthens Black Knight as having the attributes of a legitimate player when in fact it is a central figure in the greatest economic crime in human history.\nResearch made by lawyer Neil Garfield whose blog is Living Lies",Bank of America Personal Loans,trustpilot.com,female,0,False

Recently we made a mistake of shopping at a local business that we have had bad experiences at before. We were purchasing hay for our horses which in our state there is no sales tax. This ripoff business insists on charging sales tax. When they would not refund the tax we told them to cancel the order while we were still there at the counter. They refused to do either stating there are no refunds on feed....which is not posted anywhere on the premises.\n\n1)  We had a choice of taking the hay and accept being defrauded....not an option.\n\n2) We could have refused to leave without a refund and possibly be arrested.....not an option.\n\n3) We could refuse to take possession of the hay and dispute the charges on our card.\n\nWe did #3. BOA did not even give our dispute credence because they said we \u0027abandoned\u0027 the merchandise and it was a legitimate charge we authorized. Of course we authorized it until they put illegal sales tax on the purchase.\n\nBOA caused us to be victimized twice. We have exemplary credit and put every single thing we buy on a card every month and pay off the balance at the end of each month. We have since acquired another bank credit card and will no longer use BOA for any purchases. We are also considering moving all of our savings to another major bank as well.

Bank of America - it\u0027s just the most terrible and disgusting bank in the US, which I only know !!!\nI have been a customer of this bank for almost two years. I had a business account and a personal account (there was a debit and credit card).\nAfter my closing, I was told at the bank that I should not owe anything to the bank, that is, even the bank would owe me some cents. An employee on the phone told me then that these cents would be mailed to me in the form of a paper check.\nFurther, I just forgot about it and knew that I should receive a check on my mail.\nThen after a while I saw a letter on my e-mail stating that I have outstanding debts. I did not respond to this letter, because I decided that it was some kind of mistake.\nAfter several months, I looked into my folder again - spam in my email inbox (and after closing my account in the bank, I unsubscribed from mailings that came to my postal address from the Bank of America).\nAnd I saw that the amount of my debt increased from about $ 1.50 to $ 6, and then $ 8.\nI went and closed the amount of my debt.\nThen a few months later, I again had the amount of debt, and as a result, it grew to $ 11 .. I also did not immediately respond to this ..\nAnd in the end I went to the Bank of America itself to figure out and find out why this is happening!\nI was at the Bank of America near Sheepshead Bay Road. There, I explained everything and explained in detail what happened after my credit card (personal account) was closed.\nIn the Bank of America, an employee is a woman, she made a phone call and immediately spoke a little herself, and then sat me at a separate table with a phone and I started talking to the bank employees on the phone.\nAs a result, after talking with the employee on the phone for a long time, I explained everything to him (it was a man), to which he replied to me that they say, close this amount last time, and he told me the amount a little more than I had on my email..\nThe amount was $ 12.02 - this is the amount he assured me and began to convince the latter with all the hidden interest (commissions). In a word, everything, there will be no more charges in my address !!!\nWell, I agreed and asked 10 times this employee that this is 100% my last payment, I even asked his name and wrote it down to myself.\nAfter that, I went to another Bank of America, which is located on Kings Highway and made the final payment at the checkout there, so I paid the amount of: $ 12.02. I was accordingly given a bank receipt of payment for this amount.\nI sighed everything and thought that I had already closed this question completely and now I should forget about it.\nMarch 14, 2019, about a month after I repaid the debt, I decided to go to the spam folder in my email and what I saw there ..\nThe Bank of America sent me a letter again in the mail saying that I owed the bank an amount of $ 1.42 cents (arrears on my credit card).\nAnd it was absolutely not funny for me !!! I immediately called by phone that I had at the Bank of America on the hotline phone number (800) 421-2110. I was connected with a man. I told him everything abbreviated, that I closed my account (closed my credit card) - October 9, 2018 and so on ...\nThen he answered me that he already knew that I was calling him on this issue. He told me that he would cancel this amount and I would not owe anything.\nI asked this employee to send me a written confirmation that I do not have any debts to the Bank of America at my home address.\nI called him in the evening, somewhere around 10:30 pm.

Anyway,  I have a good number of credit cards with various banks, all of which I immediately put on autopay, paying the full balance every month.  Never have I had anywhere close to the level of difficulty, confusion, frustration and amount of time invested to have things run smoothly as I have had to put into my account with B of A. \n\nWe setup autopay last Spring, but then we discovered payments had not been made on time and had incurred overdue fees and interest on those unpaid bills as a result.  But why weren\u0027t we monitoring more closely? We also didn\u0027t receive our paper bills like we should have and no emails were sent about overdue payments until a month later.  Life is too crazy and hectic to monitor everything all the time -- that\u0027s why we setup autopay - so we can think less about one aspect of life...ya just can\u0027t auto-feed babies or by-pass spending time with them, doing dishes, cleaning the house.\n\nToday, the agent I was transferred to for online account access issues was totally flummoxed as to how to setup autopay.

They take 3 days to include a wired deposit and use the time to toss \u0022over-draft\u0022 charges in the account; they have lost deposits I have made (fortunately I always keep the deposit slip); they are very difficult about connecting with Quicken...so many irritating things.

I had found a very nice used car FSBO – a Honda Accord wagon, fully loaded, in excellent condition, with 96K miles. It really was a peach of a car! But I was a few thousand $$ short. I went to B of A and asked to see a loan officer. He was summoned and emerged from his office in the back. I was not invited into his office, nor was I offered a chair. We stood in the entrance to a hallway and he asked what I needed. I told him about the car, the amount of money I had for a down payment, and the amount of money I needed to borrow. He barely glanced at me as he said, “We don’t make loans in such small amounts. I suggest you put the purchase on your credit card.” Then he excused himself and walked away. ?!! I’m 50 something and female. I had an excellent credit record (partly because I’m not stupid enough to use my credit card to buy a car), a modest but steady income, and a substantial down payment. But he couldn’t be bothered with such small potatoes, leaving me to wonder “Just who is serving whom here?” A short time later our nation witnessed the collapse of the financial sector and the phrase “too big to fail” entered our public consciousness. My experience taught me that B of A regarded itself as very big and important and regarded me, their long-time customer, as very small and unimportant.

Recently I attempted to deposit a check at a bank ATM- the ATM screen displayed a message saying that it could not accept checks at that time.

They basically disregarded the initial information that I gave them and sided with the vendor I filed against. Then to add insult to injury, I presented additional, detailed information, which proved the facts of my dispute, and Bank of America still supported the vendor. So I do not know what type of individuals they employ to handle disputes, but I feel that they do not truly value their customers. I experienced poor service/ frustration from the vendor, just to again be disappointed and frustrated by my bank.

I get a notification on my app I'm at a -888,888.00 balance. When I call the bank I'm told the bank did it for security risk so no one including me can touch the account. Turns out its frozen and due to be closed due to possible check fraud. Come to find out a favor I did for a so called friend turned out to be a bad check. It was never cashed it was returned and I got a 12.00 fee for returned check. I have been told so many lies by over 10 different employees i have spoken to since may 11th till today may 27th. My Bill's that are debited out of my account are gonna go through, that was a lie. Call in 3 days and will have an answer, that's was a lie. Request was put in to get my money sent to me that I have in my account, that was a lie. They say they make a note on my account everytime I call, that was a lie. It keeps going on and on. My Bill's are hounding me and late fees are adding up. When I ask I'm sure late fees will not be paid by bank of America cause they the ones that froze my account and that's the only truth I get is that they are not responsible for my late fees. I was also told it could take 3 months to resolve the issue. When I asked can anyone call the investigator on my case and they response was there isn't a number it's a group of analyst reviewing my account. So if there is an emergency for example a fire they dont have a phone to call 911 there are just gonna sit there. Bank of America is full of it. When I asked so being a customer since 1993 doesn't mean anything no credit or nothing, all I get is dead silence and then the same crap again that my account is being investigated.

Basically, the only services of Bank of America's that I can use are the ATMs and the online and telephone customer service. If I were to request checks, or to (god forbid) want to walk into the bank and speak to a human being, I would have to pay for that service. I was extremely put off by that, but at least they offer a “free” option, as I was not going to pay to be part of a bank.Besides that, I haven't had any real problems. I did have an issue with an overdraft fee and a customer service representative; the first person that I talked to told me that she couldn't help me. However, I called back and another representative graciously helped me. I guess it all depends on who you talk to. Luckily, the problem was resolved.I REALLY like the Bank of America app that allows you to deposit checks from your phone. Now, that's pretty cool.

I generally only do stuff online so I am not that familiar with the in branch experience other than the one thing I'll mention below. For online though, I don't think B of A can be beat. Their website has always been very fast and easy for me to use.The one problem I had was while I was there, the monthly fee changed as did the minimum requirements. At the time I wasn't really using this account much and I had just graduated and didn't have a lot of money. I got a monthly charge for not having enough funds in my account to meet the minimum. Needless to say that this was not something I was happy about. So I went in to my local branch expecting to have to argue and complain and probably close my account and go through the hassle of moving somewhere else. Instead though, I was nicely treated and when I explained my problem, the lady I spoke to said that they understand and that she would refund the charge to my account and waive the minimum requirements for the next 6 months.I think most places provide good service or appear to when everything is going fine, but the way they treat you when something goes wrong is the real test and in that regard Bank of America really impressed me.

When BofA anticipates tough times ahead they prepare to protect themselves from defaults by cutting back the credit they have out there.

That is BS since I am a member of AAA and they bill me annually. I can choose to renew or not and no one asks for the card back. We sent the card back over 2 months ago and they still haven't credited her account. Well my mom died 2 weeks ago and I wanted to pay the card but not until the credit was on there. They asked me 20 questions and finally I said look either give me the credit or I am not paying the bill and you can sue a dead person. They got a supervisor on the phone who said that the deceased department would have to call me back. I said no now or never and they said later.

There were multiple issues throughout the process and every time I just had to accept what loan officers (and their managers) prescribed or else I would need to go get the mortgage elsewhere. Specific issues:1. Rate lock without consent: The loan officer locked the rate without my consent. When I reached out to the his manager to intervene she offered a solution - I go to some other bank (she'll reimburse me for the appraisal costs incurred so far) or I stay with BofA and the rate stays locked. Being just 2 weeks from my closing date, I had no other alternative but to go with the rate that the loan officer locked without my consent.2. Lack of communication: About 10 days prior to my scheduled closing date, I asked for closing early by 3 days. Loan officer responded saying - I see no issues why we can't. After that I sent multiple emails to the loan officer, loan coordinator and their managers for an update but the next meaningful update I received from them was at 7 PM on the day before closing - At that point they needed more documents from me. Eventually, they closed my loan on Aug 31st after I waited at the title company's office for an hour.3. Bait and switch: The loan officer promised a lower lender origination fees ($785) but told me on the day of my closing that it would be $1135. The explanation: the original quote was for a single family home and he realized on the day of closing that I'm purchasing a condo and hence higher fees. The resolution: On the day of closing when I'm waiting at the title company's office to sign papers, the loan officer calls me, tells me that the fees will be higher and he'll clear the loan only if I accept the higher origination fees otherwise he won't.I have been a BofA customer for 9 years and I am soon going to move to some other bank for the bulk of my banking needs.",Bank of America Mortgages,wallethub.com,,1,False

I said I was worried about missing our purchase contract date and losing our home, since it was in a very hot neighborhood in Seattle and we had gotten a great deal. I was continuously reassured that we would not miss the date. They missed it. We got an extension and they missed it again. Fortunately, our sellers were out of town and we lucked out; they didn’t want to open back up for more offers (the house had been discovered by then). We could have lost the house.Now, four years later, I'm trying to refinance (with another lender, thank goodness). I’ve had eight hours over the course of a month or more on the phone with this place. I had a Covid deferral that needed to be paid off. I couldn’t pay it directly, so I had to get it “moved to the front.” I paid the $9k. The funds were “unapplied.” I had to call in again, they “released” them, sent a new payoff letter. Poof! There was a new $3800 payment for Covid I needed to make, and it showed that my regular payment was late (It wasn’t; I paid it on time). Both my regular payment and my escrow payment went to “unapplied funds.” So I called in again, went through the phone tree and got them both “applied.” Except I didn’t. The $3800 still wasn’t applied. So I called in again. After my fourth or fifth experience escalating to the centralized escalation team (or a manager, depending), I had to ask them to do it again. A manager named Erin this time said she would do it and call me in the morning to confirm whether it had happened. I said, “I need your number so I can be sure I won’t get left hanging.” “Sorry, we don’t have one; we are inbound only. I will definitely call you.” Surprise! She didn’t. Surprise! The $3800 still isn’t applied. Also, my current escalation manager says the previous folks left no documentation. I’m now being told I should talk to a new department.

Their customer service is also very good. I have always been greeted every time I have walked through any of their branch doors. Their tellers are professional, quick and knowledgeable.

We did not want to lose the card or the very large credit limit we had established on it, but due to unforeseen circumstances, we came to a point in our lives where we were simply not able to keep up with everything, including our monthly payments on the card.When we dove into doing everything we could to pay our debts, repair our credit and avoid bankruptcy at all costs, I called Bank of America and was transferred to a debt specialist who worked with me on the phone for over an hour coming up with a doable plan to reduce our payment and stop further interest from accruing. As long as we kept up with our end of things, there would be no further penalty and once our debt was paid off, Bank of America would issue us new cards. While they never technically closed our account so it wouldn't appear as a card-issuer closure on our credit report, they did ask that we send them our current cards and would not authorize any purchases to be make on the account.Our debt specialist was wonderful and checked in on us every quarter for the next few years as we diligently made our payments. I felt as if the specialist were truly concerned and once we finished making our payments, we received our agreement, marked paid in full, from Bank of America.

I have since transitioned into a grown-up account (they call it something more professional, of course) and that comes with a few new fees. The one that really bugs me is the ""account maintenance fee"" of $12 per month which they only charge if your balance falls below $1500. Times are tight, so it sucks that I have to keep that much extra in my checking account just to avoid their massive fee which would otherwise add up to $144 per year!But other than that fee, the bank has been great.

I've been lucky to have only one over draft, which was reversed when I provided online documentation of when my purchase was made, and when the over draft occurred.

I love that my account (MyAccess Checking) is free with direct deposit so I donât have to worry about any monthly fees and that every time I have had any kind of problems or questions the people that work there seem to be eager to fix or answer them for me without making me feel dumb about it.

Another is you have to keep a minimum balance otherwise they will close your account. A couple minor problems, I've had with them in the past is the speed in which they process online and ACH payments which is kind of slow compared to some banks. For Bank of America, it was taking 5-7 business days, but other banks it has been only 1-3 days at the most. I've also had some pretty nasty overdraft fees that were charged before some of my deposits were processed.

247,eric,11/29/2013,5,"This checking account is pretty ideal for my needs. I usually try to avoid banking fees at all costs, because it is an unnecessary expense for me, and impedes my ability to save. I only had $150 to open the account, meaning didn't have the $300 to avoid the fee. Luckily they provide another way to avoid it: a $25 monthly transfer from my checking account. I have direct deposit from my job, so this is all very automatic and convenient. At this rate, I can turn off the monthly transfers in a few months if I choose, but I think I will keep them going. The yearly interest rate isn't really a draw for me, as I don't think I'll ever have enough in the account for it to make much of a difference. Overall though, the account is super convenient, and I can make manual transfers between accounts online, and luckily, Bank of America ATMs are ubiquitous, adding to the convenience.

Personally I like the Amex One card, where you just get 1 percent of everything put in a special savings account you can withdraw in cash.

It’s just bizarre that they couldn’t trust me with an extra $500 on my BankAmericard, but they’re perfectly fine with my having an extra $12,500 at my disposal.

If ripping people of and nickel and diming your customers over petty, unnecessary charges is the American way, then this Bank definitely earns its namesake. As with most banks, the application process to setup a checking and savings account was very easy. Customer service was subpar in my opinion. I'm used to waiting in phone queues, but the wait times for B of A seemed to be more treacherous than any other experiences I have had with customer services departments at different banks. When I finally did get through, B of A was horrible at resolving any issues in a timely and effective manner. I often found myself wanting to throw my phone at the ground while talking to their customer service reps. On to my next and most important point… they screw you over with fees that many other banks simply don't have. There is a $14 monthly fee for checking accounts if the average daily balance is not at least $1,500. In this tough economy, where people are struggling, who really needs that? No thanks, I'd rather stick with HSBC and avoid fees on my account and get the same exact services offered. What's that? You want to use online banking with B of A? OK, be ready to pay an $8.95 monthly service charge unless you agree to receiving only online statements AND never needing to use a teller in person for withdrawals. That's right. If you use a teller to manually withdraw any money, you will need to pay the $8.95 fee! Hopefully by now, you see where this is going.... B of A rips you off, plain and simple.

It's very simple and like another reviewer said, bare boned. I could pay my bills online and not constantly have to carry cash with me.

I like that BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature Card lays out the points perfectly and ease for members to use. Racking up points for purchases will be super easy and quick. I use my card a lot for purchases. The transfer fee for balance transfers is a bit high considering I like to do a lot of transfers within the month.

The downside is that you are limited towards a statement credit towards travel, not for cash back, gift cards, or other rewards that other programs offer.

As soon as I found out I missed a payment, I immediately called and explained missing their emails and informed them that my credit union would send the money immediately electronically. It would have been good customer relations to waive the fee, but they refused to do so. The main problem with BoA was after I pad and they received the money, I received a letter from BoA stating that my credit limit (built up over years) had been reduced to $500 from $57,500. If I wanted a store charge card, I would have gotten one and it would have been much more that $500. I called to ask how the decision was made, Tonya was no help and I asked for a manager. After waiting on hold for about 20 minutes, I hung up and will not ever speak to anyone there again. Absolutely the worst customer service imaginable, how anyone uses BoA is beyond me.

I have gotten many overdrafts overturned because their customer service agents were nice enough to listen to what happened and make a judgment call. While I've paid many fees in the past to Bank of America, I feel like their customer service over the years makes it worth it. Any time I needed something simple in the past, such as a replacement debit card, they were extremely fast and courteous to me on the phone.Aside from their spectacular customer service skills, their online site is a lifesaver. Keeping track of a budget for me is extremely hard at times, but having all of the information online makes budgeting out my month much easier. I never receive a paper statement anymore, which is great.The reason I gave them three stars in “clear disclosures” is because their policies can be hard to understand sometimes, especially when it comes to fees.

Those bankers that you speak with are a mixed bag of customer service and can be very slow to help.They also seem to be understaffed at busy times, in my experience, with only one or two tellers.

It was easy to set up a direct deposit and I can pay off my mortgage early. They include a few tools to see how much faster you can pay it off with different methods like biweekly payments or additional payments. You can also pay a little more on principle or escrow online. They also have a calendar that shows when you are due and where late charges come into play.The thing I use the most though is the iPhone app where you can pay your mortgage on the phone so I don't even have to log into the computer. All in all, it's not bad. They are a few things I wish they had though like an auto pay feature but I am not sure I have heard of any banks offering that.Also, if you have an escrow and it goes over the amount authorized there is no option to just put that money on the principle. They end up sending you a check at the end of the year and you have to go cash it then bring it back to them.

The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars is that their loans are not really competitive.

I am a heavy user of credit cards for cashback and such so I just budget how much I will need and keep it in the checking account to pay off the cards. The customer service is meh.

I love that they have a nice, secure online banking system that's relatively easy to navigate and make transfers and pay off my credit card. I love that I get pretty decent cash-back on my credit card purchases and there's no annual fee for the card.The negative: Calling for simple issues can sometimes be a pain, it takes a while to get through to a person (I don't need to hear that I can check my account online 8x before trying to resolve my issue). But it is nice that it's 24/7 and I have to say that although the phones are flawed, online chat support is very nice and convenient (but I'm not always by a computer).I'm also not a fan of the fees they try to stick you with sometimes, e.g. too many transfers in a month one time cost me $5, and I wasn't warned or made aware of this fee before it was taken.My interest on my savings could be a bit higher, it's pretty abysmally low.Overall: Love the convenience, but there's some bad things when you go with such a large bank, they don't seem to care too much about you.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,2,False

I was given the option to get overdraft coverage for my account. I got it with a click of a button. Needless to say there were a couple of times that I had to use it and it was great that I only got a charge of $10.00 instead of the normal $32.00 when I had an oops in my bank account. For some reason it recently just disappeared and in order to get it again there are many more steps to the process and I no longer qualify! I still have not figured out what happened! The only other problem is there are not enough locations. My husbands employer does not offer direct deposit and the closest Bank of America to his workplace is over sixty miles! By the time he gets home the bank is already closed. Sometimes he gets paid in the middle of the week and we have to wait till the weekend to make the deposit.

However, they tend to find any way possible to charge you fees, using a non-BoA ATM will net you not only the ATM fee but an additional BoA fee, overdraft protection from savings will get you a $10 charge every time, and the talk of charging a monthly checking fee is disconcerting.

364,Fia H,02/08/2013,4,"I have been a B of A customer for about 9 years. B of A is the only bank I have ever been with, and where I hold three accounts, checking, savings, and a credit card. I have had nothing but a great experience with the customer service at B of A. For 9 years, I have never been charged an account fee. I originally signed up as a student and they offered free checking. Then to keep the free checking I just had to keep a minimum balance. One particular experience I was satisfied with was when I deposited $700 cash in an ATM at school. Somehow, the ATM on my college campus was jammed and the place where you put the money into the ATM closed up and the screen read “This ATM is temporarily out of service”. Before the screen went blank though, it read “We were unable to determine the cash amount deposited, please enter the amount”. I entered in the amount of $700, and in good faith that this would be the amount credited to my account. I immediately called B of A from the number on the ATM and let them know the machine just went down with my money still in the dispenser, they said that my account would be credited the amount I typed in. That night I went home, did some calculations and realized I had actually put $800 in the machine. I called B of A and let them know the discrepancy and they initiated a claim, but still allowed me the extra $100 in credit. They said I would get a letter a couple of days later, after the ATM machines were balanced, if there were any issues. I received a letter stating all was fine. I was just happy that they were able to credit my money, even without knowing the exact amount I put in. They relied on what I said, and I was able to have my money that day. Also, compared to other banks their overdraft policy is not bad at all because they do not charge you if it’s less than $10, or if you had money in your account the day of the transaction. The only thing I would suggest is NOT to use their online chat system. I got the runaround for about 20 minutes the time I tried. The rep (who I assume is contracted in a different country) didn't know what the heck I was trying to say.

The benefits are lots of options for online banking and also that you can find a local branch almost anywhere in the U.S. However, there have been a few times when I considered switching banks. The first was the nationally publicized fiasco where they were strongly considering charging someone to use their debit card. Fortunately, they did not go through with it and thus I stayed a customer. I also had a personal problem where they deactivated my debit card due to questionable purchases, which were never made. I pulled $100 out of an ATM one time, which I rarely do, and they deactivated my card. I guess I should feel safe, but I'd rather them wait to deactivate it until there were multiple questionable transactions. Also, since it's a debit card, surely the fact that I had to enter my pin number for the transaction made it less questionable. The silver lining is that their problem resolution was very swift and easy. All in all, I'd recommend them.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,4,False

I chose Bank of America because I have four checking/savings accounts with them (and a mortgage) and I wanted to be able to link the card to my other accounts for convenience.

Now that I'm older the account is pretty much a dud. I barely use it because I don't want to be slammed with fees. The lack of interest on the account also makes it less than great when you look at other banks. Also, this is worth mentioning- their customer service is HORRIBLE.

That bank account I ended up having for about six years.It had no return on its investment. But the most positive thing about B of A was how easy it was to withdraw or deposit money, at that time. Unfortunately since then my local branch has not been quite so expedient, and even worse the interest rates on my accounts never amounted to diddly squat.

When I went to another state to buy something, my card was locked due to “unusual purchases” Although this may seem like an inconvenience, it showed me that Bank of America was serious about protecting my money. Also, a few months back my card number was stolen, and used half way across the country. Unfortunately Bank of America didn’t catch on this time, but when I noticed it and reported it, Bank of America refunded my money! That refund came right out of their bottom line, to me.

They never explained aspects of their banking system to me, causing me to incur fees that I never anticipated. Though the fees were paid back, I was only reimbursed after complaining on the telephone to several different BoA associates.

At one time I had $120 worth of fees because of that and was simply told that was how their system worked.

Like many people, I have ended up upside down on my loan, but that isn’t BOA’s fault.

I’ve become increasingly frustrated with their glitch filled online banking system and their poor customer service. In part I think there is a correlation between the increase in my disappointment in Bank of America’s customer service and their recent acquisition of Merrill Lynch and several other financial institutions. My reasoning is mostly derived from the fact that a majority of the short comings are a result of a redundant bureaucracy. So many people are performing the same tasks that other important one’s get ignored. For example, a few weeks ago I lost a credit card that was issued by Bank of America. So, naturally I went into my local branch and waited 1.5 hrs for an accounts rep.

You can buy groceries using your credit card, and when you get home, pay for them immediately, especially if you have a Bank of America checking account.

Treat any credit card, including this one, as if it was a debit card, making sure to only spend what you can pay off, and you will be on your way to living a sane financial life and having a lot less worry overall about your finances. I honestly don't have any real issues with this card, it's a simple card meant to build your credit and get you in the habit of paying it off on time. If you don't have a stable income or way to pay off your balance, don't get a credit card until you can save up a cash cushion, at least in my opinion. I've banked with Bank of America since forever and it's definitely convenient and a safer alternative to cash to carry around. (Pay off your balance on time! It'll save you so many headaches, any potential new card-holders! There are minimum interest fees, late fees, all this crazy stuff.

It was actually tied to my xbox account which was hacked and the card was charged multiple times from that account. I contacted the support and the charges were rescinded immediately and I received a new card within a few days. I always pay off my monthly statement so I incur no penalties or interest fees.

There were a couple of times where my tenant submitted a check instead of having the rent electrically transferred from his account to mine. I was very disappointed that on both counts I was charged a fee for the tenant not adding the money electronically. Instead of automatically being penalized, there should have been a warning.

Thankfully, my experience has been limited to only my checking account. Bank of America provides all kinds of incentives and offers the latest in smart phone apps. A big plus for Bank of America is their availability. It’s difficult to not run into one of their ATM’s or locations while you’re traveling.

After that, though, the whole thing tanks. You can count on everything that you agreed to being amended into something that solely benefits the bank and has no concern for how it may effect you and your credit score. I had taken a personal loan to cover the remaining costs of my final year of college with the intent to pay it off in under 5 years. Needless to say this didn't happen. After approximately 3-6 months of paying on time, my terms and rate were augmented where the payments increased. Luckily, I didn't have too much of an issue with it because I had a good paying job and could handle the change. I have been over paying it off steadily for 5 years with five thousand left on the loan. What changed in the structure of the loan was that since I used the checks they provided and not my own the bank can label the transactions as 'transfer' funds and put a hefty fee and additional interest on the amounts. I called to refinance the loan and they sent me over to an 'independent' debt management company. I signed up with the debt company with their assurance that BoA would agree to the terms and I'd be totally debt free, including outstanding credit cards and the BoA loan, within 4 years. BoA rejected their proposal, I missed a full payment because they took their time in responding so I got a nice $49 fee on top of everything that they already charge me. They string you along with promises of help and punish you for taking their advice. I will never, ever, ever deal with them again.",Bank of America Personal Loans,wallethub.com,male,1,False

On top of that, I owed BoA close to $500 in overdraft fees. My logic in trying to understand this. How could I use the money out if it wasn't actually available in my account? At the very least, the transactions I made during the weekend should have gone through, and the check itself bounce, but it appears that transactions were processed in a way that would maximize the amount of fees the bank could recover. This was the final straw for me with this Bank.

Also, I received 35 dollars on my checking account for referring a friend of mine to the bank.

The promotion matched up to $250. Who could pass that up? What the program does is round up your debit card purchases to the next dollar, and the excess amount goes into savings (for example, from a $5.10 purchase, $6 will be deducted from checking and $.90 will go into your savings account.What I did to make sure to reach my match is to go grocery shopping late at night, when there are no crowds, and use the self-checkout to ring items separately or in pairs to make sure that I reached the $250 match. I think I ended up around $230, which was great and kept me as a Bank of America customer. I also really like how you can customize alerts, such as if a deposit has come through or if the amount has dipped below an amount that you can preset.

When I first received the card, I was in college and I did not have much of a credit history to speak of. In that respect, it was nice, but that's one of the few positive things I can mention about it. Bank of America's rates are unreasonably high and you need to be extremely careful to be diligent about your payments. Miss a payment and your rates are likely to double (this is in addition to an exorbitant late fee charge). BoA's website (which I use solely for payment of the Visa) is not very intuitive, but I guess it works once you figure it out. I guess in terms of a basic credit card, this is fine if it's all you qualify for. Then again, I'd be hard pressed to agree to terms that were less customer friendly.

Each time the representative was helpful, pleasant and quite efficient. My credit limit started at $800, but was increased to $1000 with a simple call and only a few questions regarding my employment status. It is a rather “bare bones” card in the sense that you don’t get any rewards, but it is very simple to use. It connects with your Bank of America online checking account which makes it very easy to pay monthly bills as well.

The first thing that attracted me to this card was the 3% cash back on gas and 2% on groceries - something I always have to buy, so why not save some money doing it? The 1% cash back on all other purchases is pretty standard for a cash rewards card, but in conjunction with the gas and groceries, makes this card very nice overall. There is a $100 cash back bonus for spending $500 within the first 3 months of the card, which is just icing on the cake.

The problems started when I returned home to NY. I set up one of my direct deposits to go into the account so it wouldn't charge me any fees, but when I went to use my debit card after every 2nd time I used it my card would be flagged as stolen and I wouldn't be able to use it until I called the 800 number. I explained the situation multiple times and asked each time to have a note added to the account saying that I was a student and the card was not stolen every time it was used in NY, and was told each time this was not possible, and my options were either to close the account, wait, and then open a new one in NY and hope that someone depositing cash from California wouldn't get my account flagged, or deal with my debit card being shut down every other time I used the card. Some of the customer service folks I spoke to were friendly and sympathetic, some however were very rude and couldn't understand why anyone would ever spend time in a different state than the one they had opened a bank account in - I guess they've never heard of college students or people who live by state borders or move!I closed the account after 3 months, there were no benefits to the account that were worth putting up with the hassle.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,1,False

This helps me keep my spending under control and my financial affairs in perfect order. As a recently fiscally-independent young adult, this takes a lot of stress off my mind. For me, using this credit card is the same as using my debit card because it feels like I'm drawing money from MY ACCOUNT (and not putting it on someone else's ledger) and I have yet to carry a balance.

573,Freddie Obregón,03/06/2013,3,"I have three criticisms about this checking account with Bank of America (BoA) and only two of them are big. I had to open this account because this bank is in my home suburb. It was the bank that issued paychecks at my job and was the only bank that was authorized to process electronic transactions at my undergraduate college of The University of Texas. The first criticism out of all of this is that I had to have a minimum of over $1000 in order to keep the account free. As soon as I dipped below this number I had to pay around $11 monthly to keep it open. What a price to pay given the state of our current economy! This bank could learn from Wells Fargo and/or credit unions that offer free checking accounts to college students and the general public, respectively. The second criticism was that when I had to close this account, the workers at the branch made a production out of it, even as to go as far and tell me that I was rude (!). Again, a lesson could be learned from Wells Fargo – when I had to close an account there, the workers gave me no issue. Finally, the last hurdle I had to jump was the money order price: at the time it was around $5 for a money order, but this shock was softened by a nice worker who told me “Oh, you shouldn't get them from here, mi'jo. They're pretty expensive!” Now, THAT'S a lesson that should be taught to all bank employees. More positive news about this checking account was that I had no issue with bank errors or suspicious charges and the like, so that's why my star review is in the “alright” range.

They had a promotion at the time that if you opened a savings account at the same time, and had a set monthly transfer of at least $25 from your checking to your savings account then you could avoid monthly fees. Obviously, I opened up a savings account that day. The things I like about my savings account are that I can transfer immediately between my checking and savings and that there are no transfer fees between my accounts.

I wish that I could say that I am happy with them but I really am not completely happy. I stay with them mainly for convenience reasons and because it's really a huge pain to switch banks. But, that just means I have been loyal to them, not that they really care. I have a direct deposit to my account. I was away on maternity leave for 6 weeks and wasn't getting paid. They refused to waive the fee for me due to not getting direct deposit for that time. I was a new mom and a single one at that NOT getting paid at all for maternity leave and because I wasn't getting a direct deposit they charged me a fee for my savings account. After being with them for so long that was pretty infuriating.Additionally, they have charged me overdraft fees of $35 when the overdraft had not even occurred! The latest time I was charged for a daycare check that was still processing. I had money in the process of being transferred from my Paypal and the check had not even cleared and they charged the overdraft fee. Even if you overdraft by .50 they charge you a $35 fee. It's sickening. I had to fight with them for WEEKS to get that fee reversed. They refused and refused even though the Paypal money posted BEFORE the check cleared. They argued with me saying the check wasn't what put me over, that a $25 grocery store charge that had already cleared put me over which made no sense because that would only have over drafted me if they check had already been taken out of my account. They just kept talking their way around it.The customer service is ok, not great, just ok. The one thing I can say is that they are good about handling unauthorized charges. They have handled a few fraud cases for me over the past 7 years and they always get me my money back. That is probably a key factor in my staying with them.They have a banking app that is great but it doesn't always completely sync up with what they have in their system so be cognizant of that.Overall, they are ok.

Each time when I brought this ridiculousness to their attention, they rectified the problem and credited my account, but in my opinion mistakes like this are unacceptable and could potentially cause significant problems for a customer, above and beyond the inherent hassles involved with making time to notify them of their errors.

When I began, I started with the usual; checking and savings account. The one major problem with both of those; the fees. Here’s an example of what I mean. On occasion I would make transfers from my savings to my checking in case I needed the money for whatever might pop up. There was one occasion where I knew I had to transfer over a larger sum, and I did. I had a number of bills to pay and some automatic payments set up. I thought everything would be fine. Towards the end of the month I ended up with several fees charged, including a 70 dollar fee for going over the transfer limit no one told me about. Here’s another; I did some work for a friend and was paid by check. My fiance at the time messed up and we had to put a stop payment on it, which was also messed up. So not only did I have a fee for that, I had an overdraft fee because the fee they charged put me in the negative. So my fiance wired some money from her account to try and fix it and got hit with another fee for the wire transfer that no one told me about when I made the account. Their fees, are not only a major source of aggravation, but are annoying to deal with as well. I won’t even get started on the customer service I received.

The end result was that I had to wait 3 weeks to get a new card even though there was no fraud and had to pay a fee to correct a problem that never existed. I cannot in good conscience recommend this bank to anyone.The fees, charges, and limitations placed on accounts will leave you scratching your head many, many times.The positive side is that the bank is very well known, reputable, and secure, as long as you are willing to put up with the minor annoyances, you shouldn't have too many problems banking with them.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,4,False

Not only did I have to pay a late fee, they also interest charge on the full amount because of their mistake! All of this over $0.79!!!

629,Janice Krasinski,01/29/2020,5,"The BankAmericard credit card is amazing. It was my MVP a few years back, helping me pay off a pretty sizable balance from another card that was charging an arm and a leg in interest. The 0% period is longer than most (if not all) other balance transfer cards, the balance transfer fee is standard, and there’s no annual fee. So, I don’t really see why anyone would say they didn’t like this card. Either they’re off their rocker or they transferred their balance after the 60-day window to get a 0% rate. Or they didn’t pay on time and got stuck with the card’s high regular rate. Or their application got rejected because they didn’t have an excellent credit score. Ok, sure, there are ways your relationship with this BankAmericard could go sour, but it’s a lot less likely than with some other credit cards.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,2,False

Overall it seems like BofA launched these new BankAmericards with travel rewards just to throw a bone to frequent travelers who were getting cards from other companies, and what they came up with are poor imitations of some already popular products. The BankAmericard Privileges with Travel Rewards is just a more expensive Venture Card and this BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is just the Capital One Cash Rewards Card but with points and travel branding. So if you came to this page wondering if you should get the BankAmericard Travel Rewards Card, you have your answer.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,3,False
651,Joe Weider,05/09/2012,4,"Out of the three travel rewards credit cards that Bank of America just launched, this is the option geared toward small business owners (obviously). To get a true sense of this card’s place in the business credit card hierarchy, I think it’s important to remember that BofA is the only credit card company that abides by the rules of the CARD Act, at least as far as interest rates are concerned. Other companies can raise your interest rates on debt you haven’t paid off yet whenever they want. Bank of America only does that if you miss two payments. The advice I’ve seen based on this is that you can either use a single Bank of America business credit card for small business or a standard credit card for funding and a business card for making smaller purchases and earning rewards.With that in mind, let’s take a closer look at the WorldPoints Travel Rewards for Business Visa Credit Card. It doesn’t have an annual fee, which is nice, gives you 1.5 points per dollar you charge and 5,000 bomus points after your first purchase, and has 0% on purchases for 9 months. As far as rewards are concerned, the WorldPoints Travel Rewards Business Credit Card doesn’t really compare to some of the other business cards out there. I mean, the Capital One Spark Cash for Business gives you 2% cash back on all purchases and a $100 initial bonus, and sure, it has a $59 annual fee beginning in the second year, but you can recoup that after spending $2950. The Ink Cash Business Card from Chase is another great option since it offers a $250 initial bonus, 5% cash back on the first $25k you spend on office supplies and telecom, 3% on the first $25k spent on gas and dining, and 1% on everything else. Like the BofA WorldPoints Travel Card, it doesn’t have an annual fee either.Overall, I’d say get the WorldPoints Travel Rewards Business Visa if you want the simplicity of using one card for business, but you can get a whole lot more value with the Ink Cash for Business and a 0% card like the Citi Simplicity.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,2,False
652,Joe Weider,05/09/2012,4,"The BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is I guess the standard option in Bank of America’s new suite of travel rewards credit cards (I mean the other consumer card has Privileges in the name and the WorldPoints Card is for business). Anyway if you’re looking for a travel rewards credit card, you need to figure out whether the BankAmericard Travel Rewards Card is going to be the most rewarding option in light of your spending habits and interests (you don’t want a card that gives you hotel rewards if you never stay at hotels).As you can see from the top of this page, the Travel Rewards BankAmericard gives you a 10,000 point initial bonus. I looked at the terms and conditions page, and you get these if $500 in purchases post to your account within the first 90 days. You also get 1.5 points per dollar spent across all purchases, which you can ultimately redeem for travel purchases that appear on your statement. (You can also redeem for cash, merchandise and charitable contributions, but I don’t know if you get the same value that way). Aside from the 0% on purchases the BofA Travel Rewards Card offers, that’s basically it for its benefits. You also get 3 points per dollar spent on travel purchased through BofA, but prices are usually jacked up on credit card travel programs, so I doubt this is much of a benefit.When you get down to it, this new Bank of America Travel Credit Card is decent. Whether it’s the right card for you depends. The Capital One Venture Card is a better option for people who want a card for just one year or who spend a lot on travel because it offers 2 miles for every $1 but has a $59 annual fee starting in the second year (the Travel BankAmericard doesn’t have an annual fee). If you want the best possible initial bonus, I’d go with the Chase Sapphire Preferred ($500). And if you don’t travel that much or always use the same airline or hotel chain, I’d get the Blue Cash Preferred Amex or the card tied to your favorite travel provider. Aside from that, the BankAmericard Travel Rewards Credit Card is a good option, so get it if you travel a moderate amount and won’t be able to earn enough with another card to warrant paying its annual fee.I’d love to see what Won Buddy Lee has to say about this card too!",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,2,False
653,Joe Weider,05/09/2012,4,"Bank of America is giving the people what they want: travel rewards. Travel rewards cards are some of the flashiest and most sought after cards issuers offer and BofA launched THREE new offers in ONE day. That’s a lot to digest, but I’ll give breaking down these offers a whirl, starting with the BankAmericard Privileges with Travel Rewards Credit Card. Don’t thank me, it’s my PRIVILEGE (ha, I crack myself up).The BankAmericard Privileges Card is obviously focused on travel rewards, as I’m sure you can tell from its name. It doesn’t offer any 0% introductory interest rates either. It does give you two rewards points for each dollar you spend across all purchases and lets you redeem them for travel purchase made anywhere rather than forcing you to redeem them through a BofA rewards site or something. You might think this seems eerily similar, and you’d be right. Tha Capital One Venture Card offers basically the same rewards program, right down to the 10,000 point initial bonus. Unlike the Venture Card though, the Privileges BankAmericard charges a $75 annual bonus beginning in the second year, while the Venture Card only charges $59.As you might guess, I am still a bigger fan of the Venture Card as far as ongoing rewards are concerned. Neither boxes you in in terms of logistics, though, which is nice. Finally, let me say that if you want a card that will help you benefit this summer, I wouldn’t choose either the Bank of America Travel Rewards Privileges Card or the Venture Card. I’d probably pick the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card instead.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,2,False
654,Margie Cole,04/23/2012,4,"As far as I’m concerned, people have three things to consider when deciding whether an everyday rewards card like the Bank of America Accelerated Rewards American Express Card is right for them: 1) How it compares to similar cards currently being offered; 2) How well it complements your spending habits; and 3) How convenient maximizing its rewards offerings will be. So let’s go one by one.1. How it Compares.Since the BofA Accelerated Rewards Amex Card only gives you a $50 initial bonus and 1.25 points per $1 spent, it’s rewards really aren’t competitive. You can find cards offering a couple free flights, hotel nights, and up to $500 as initial bonuses; 1.5-2% cash back across all purchases; and up to 6% cash back on major spending categories like gas and groceries.So if rewards are what youre after I’d go with the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card, the Cap One Venture, the PenFed Platinum Rewards, or the American Express Blue Cash Preferred instead of the Bank of America Accelerated Rewards Card.2.	How it complements.This card doesn’t offer any special rewards earning rates for specific spending categories, so it complements everyone’s spending the same. This could make it a good everyday rewards card if it had attractive rewards, but since it doesn’t, it’s just a missed opportunity considering that you can save 5% on gas with the PenFed Card or 6% on groceries with the Amex Blue Cash Preferred.3.	ConvenienceIm not a big fan of cards that give rewards in points. Cash back rewards are much more straightforward and do not require you to redeem often to avoid seeing your points become worth less when the credit card company ups the number you need for certain rewards. This probably wont be a big deal, but you also cant use Amex cards as many places as you can Visa or MC.Overall, the Bank of America Accelerated Rewards Amex is a fine card, especially since it doesn’t have an annual fee, but you can do better.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,0,False
655,Margie Cole,04/16/2012,4,"The BankAmericard Cash Rewards Card is an interesting offer. The reason why is that for some people, it is a really great option that will prove very lucrative, but for others it wont quite measure up to the best cards on the market. It all really depends on how much you spend on gas and groceries and whether or not you bank with Bank of America. This will become a bit more clear with a quick little pro/con list for the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Card.Pros-	Many cards offer more lucrative initial bonuses than the Bankamericard Cash Rewards Visa’s $50, but they also tend to require that you spend a few thougsand dollars in the first few months. This card’s bonus is much more attainable for less heavy spenders since you only need to spend $100 in the first 60 days to get it.-	Cash back rewards are always a plus because you know exactly what youre going to get. 3% on gas, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else is pretty good too…IF you only spend around $1500 on gas and groceries every three months.-	Getting a 10% rewards bonus is a great treat for Bank of America bank account holders as well.-	Having 0% for 12 months can also allow you to leave more money in the bank for longer and gain good interest.-	Having no annual fee on a card that offers good rewards is also pretty nice.Cons-	Since you only get the 2%/3% rates up to $1500 spend on gas and groceries combined each quarter, the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Visa Card will turn into a 1% cash back card when you hit this milestone.-	There are a few other cards out there that offer better rewards on gas and groceries.The BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card is a pretty good everyday spending credit card, but before you apply for it I suggest also checking out the Blue Cash Preferred from American Express and the PenFed Platinum Rewards Card to see which would be more lucrative for your particular spending habits.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,0,False
656,Joe Weider,03/09/2012,3,"Man, I bet a bar association credit card could buy a heck of a lot of drinks. Oh, wait…it’s not that kind of bar...it’s lawyers. Oh, well, still applies. That awful lawyer joke I made up as I was writing it aside, if you’re an American Bar Association member, you might be interested in showing your affiliation by getting an American Bar Association Business Credit Card. You shouldn’t really think of it as the American Bar Association Business Credit Card though; think of it instead as Credit Card X and evaluate it based on its terms rather than its name. In other words, you don’t want to overpay for credit card branding. Starting with rewards, the American Bar Association Business Card offers 1 rewards point per $1 spent. That’s it. Moving on to rates, the Bar Association Business Card gets you 0% on purchases for 9 months. That’s it. As you can probably tell, I’m not wild about the Bar Association Card. At this point you might be thinking, “what are you talking about, it gives you rewards and a 0% intro rate, what more could you ask for?” First of all, you don’t want to settle for an average overall card because it meets two needs. It would be much smarter to get a rewards card for everyday spending and a 0% card for saving on big ticket purchases or transferring debt. You’d get better terms overall that way. Also, there are simply way better cards that you can get with the good or excellent credit you need to get the Bar Association Credit Card.What are those cards, you ask? Well, if you want rewards, I’d go with the business credit card offering the best terms of your biggest expenses. The Ink Bold with Ultimate Rewards and the American Express Simply Cash Card are pretty good options. If you want low rates, I’d go with the No Balance Transfer Fee Slate Card from Chase, which offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 15 months and does not charge a transfer fee. Yes, that is a personal credit card, that is intentional. You aren’t put at any additional risk by using a personal credit card and get to benefit from the fact that issuers cannot increase interest rates on personal credit card unless you’re at least 60 days delinquent.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,4,False
657,Joe Weider,03/08/2012,3,"Diamondback fans have gotta be wondering, will Trevor Bauer make the opening day rotation or assume a role in it shortly thereafter and would the Arizona Diamondbacks Credit Card make a good addition to your wallet? As far as Bauer is concerned, he’ll have to work for it, but he should soon join Hudson and Kennedy in the rotation. Deciding whether or not to get the Diamondbacks Credit Card depends on what exactly it offers since you do not want to overpay for branding, especially when you can personalize the entire front side of any Capital One credit card with the picture of your choosing and effectively turn it into a Diamondbacks Credit Card. The Diamondbacks Credit Cards rewards are as follows: 3% cash back on gas, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else and a 10% rewards bonus when you redeem your cash back into a Bank of America bank account. In terms of rates, the Diamondbacks Card offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 15 months but charges a 4% balance transfer fee.The rewards offered by the Diamondbacks Credit Card are pretty good, especially if you already have or can get a free Bank of America bank account. However, most people probably spend more on groceries than they do on gas, so for them the Blue Cash Everyday Card from Amex would be better since it offers 3% cash back at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores and 1% on everything else. The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card also offers a $500-625 initial bonus, which makes it a good option. The rates offered by the No Balance Transfer Fee Slate Card from Chase are also attractive. It gives you 0% on purchases and transfers for the same 15 months as the Diamondbacks Credit Card but does not charge any transfer fee.

While I’m certainly an entrenched Yankees fan, I can appreciate the fact that the Nationals are poised for big things, I’m just mad we didn’t keep Tyler Clippard. Anyway, you’re here because you want to see if the Nationals Credit Card is worth applying for and the biggest concern you should have is about overpaying for branding. Basically you don’t want to sacrifice money or card terms just to have a Nats symbol emblazoned on your card, especially since you can make that happen for free with any Capital One credit card. That being said lets take a gander at what the Washington Nationals Credit Card has to offer. Starting with rewards, the Nats Credit Card gives you 3% cash back on gas, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else. You also get a 10% rewards bonus if you redeem your cash back into a Bank of America bank account. How does this stack up to the rest of the good or excellent credit credit card market?Pretty well, actually. The Amex Blue Cash Everyday Card, which is one of the best everyday rewards cards, offers 3% cash back at supermarkets, 2% cash back at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on everything else. I guess which one is better depends on whether you spend more on groceries or gas and how much you spend at department stores. As far as rates are concerned, the Nationals Credit Card offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 12 months but charges a 4% balance transfer fee. This does not compare favorably to the likes of the No Balance Transfer Fee Slate Card from Chase, which doesn’t have a transfer fee and gives 0% on purchases and transfers for 15 months.

659,Joe Weider,03/07/2012,3,"For all you O’s fans out there, its unfortunately pretty clear that your team is going to be, well, terrible this year and for the foreseeable future. After all, the destructive management is still in place and ESPN did pick the O’s last in its future rankings. What remains to be seen however is whether the Baltimore Orioles Credit Card is doomed for the same fate or could be a home run, so to speak. Usually I’d take you through the Orioles Credit Cards’ terms before revealing the answer, but I sympathize with you guys so I’ll tell you now. The Orioles Rewards Card has the same terms as all of the other MLB-team-branded credit cards and while pretty good they are not necessarily the best available for people with good or excellent credit (what the O’s Credit Card and other teams’ cards require for approval). Here, I’ll show you why.The Orioles Card offers 3% cash back on gas, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else. Compare this to a card like the Blue Cash Everyday from American Express, which offers 3% at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on everything else and it doesn’t quite stack up. I mean I suppose the O’s card could be better for people who spend more on gas than groceries and never shop at department stores, especially people with Bank of America bank accounts because the MLB Team credit cards give you a 10% rewards bonus when you deposit your cash back into one. At any rate, I’d probably take the Chase Sapphire Preferred over the Orioles Card because the former gives you a $500-625 initial bonus. The difference between the Orioles Credit Card’s rates and those of the best good or excellent credit credit cards is even more obvious. The Orioles Card offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 12 months but also charges a 4% balance transfer fee. The No Balance Transfer Fee Slate Card, on the other hand, obviously doesn’t charge any sort of fee for transfers and offers 0% on purchases and balance transfers for 15 months. On other thing to point out is that if Orioles branding is all you’re looking for, any Capital One credit card allows you to customize the front of your card with the picture of your choosing, so you can of course slap an O’s logo or picture on there.

661,William Smithers,05/30/2012,5,"I've been a customer of Bank of America for almost 15 years now. They've gone throught the occasional changes where my free checking has been changed to a non-free account, but they've always given me plenty of warning and I've never had trouble switching it back to one of the free options. The telephone wait time for customer service is sometimes excessive though (40 minutes last time I called. I remember this stuff!), but the reps are always polite and eager to help.I'm a pretty casual banking user, though, since I mostly just use the account for simple things like paying bills and making debit purchases as I do my investing elsewhere with companies who do that exclusively.I've found Bank of America's automatic bill-pay setup to be especially easy to use. They'll send checks on my behalf to the people I owe when I schedule it, though I would expect that's true of any bank these days and I can't remember if this last has an extra fee, though. I'm pretty sure it doesn't for what I use it for.Identity theft protection has been great, too. Got dinged once for a fairly substantial amount, contested it and everything was resovled with negligible fuss, even though it was a debit transaction (which are notoriously difficult to deal with).Overall, I'm a happy customer.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,2,False
662,Heather Weaver,05/30/2012,2,"Bank of America has by far been my least favorite bank I have ever had the displeasure of being a member of, and I cannot wait to switch back to a credit union shortly. I signed up for the “ebanking” account, where you do not pay fees or have a minimum balance requirement as long as you do not go into the actual bank. BoA offers services to deposit checks and money via the ATM, so I assumed there would be no reason I would need a person.Unfortunately, I was wrong. At one point, my debit card number was stolen and so I was forced to cancel my card. I was promptly notified by BoA to call them, which was quite nice so points for BoA. After I called I was reassured that my mailing address was updated from Ohio to California and that my old card was cancelled and a new one would arrive within the week. The card took two weeks so I was forced to incur multiple fees as a result of having to go into the bank to access my money. The bank would not waive the fees, even though I did not have a choice. Additionally, they sent me NOT a new card, but just a copy of the same old card. I continued racking up fraudulent charges this whole time, in addition to the account fees. They also sent the card to the wrong address. It took three tries to get a new card, something a bank should be incredibly embarrassed about.

I see with pressure from the community after their bailout they decided to not do that. However they have charges for just about everything on a regular account. From too many transfer fees to monthly fees. Which they have raised twice since I have been a customer.The good stuff:1. They are quick to help if someone has gotten a hold of your debit card or card number. I have never had a problem getting my money refunded with BOA if something goes wrong.2. Long customer service hours. If I need help in the evening they are usually there up till 7 or 8. Which is nice for customers. I also enjoy their online chat. It's very helpful. Although if you are looking to get a charge removed I would call your local branch. Because once they tell you no online or over the phone via their 1-800 number the local branch can't do anything for you. Just a tip, I learned this the hard way.3.

Making your monthly payment is easy because they allow you to do it online, in the mail, or at one of their banking centers, and they send you statements regularly so you can stay informed of what you've spent. After about 6 months of making my payments on time, they raised my credit limit without me needing to do anything! The interest rate is reasonable too, and you can now personalize your card with a picture of your choice on their website.

The account does have a $5 monthly fee but you can avoid that by keeping at least $300 in your account. I live in New York City and the bank has numerous local branches but I've also lived in Atlanta, Tulsa, and Denver and each city also had plenty of locations as well.

701,Angel Colon,11/01/2013,4,"The Bank Americard Power Rewards Visa Signature credit card actually looks like a decent credit card to have. The intro rate for 12 months is pretty standard at 0.0%, same with the balance transfer at 0.0%. It’s a little disappointing that you only get $50 cash back after you spend $500 within 90 days of getting it. I know when I first got my American Express Gold card, I got $150 for doing a similar task. It’s nice that there is a grace period for late fees of $25 because you never know when you might need some extra time to pay a bill. Overall, I probably would enjoy having this card to take advantage of the gas points at 3 points per every $1. That could add up pretty quick.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,4,False

Bank of America provides its customers with an easy-to-use website so I can keep track of how much I owe.

The interest rate of 14 percent is about standard but on the low side for a point card. The cash advance is a little lower than most cards as well at 23 percent. The best thing about this card however is the point system. The bare minimum amount of points you earn for every dollar is 50 percent more than almost every card, you can even earn triple on a lot of purchases.

One time I had a fraudulent charge of 2,500$ and they immediately took it off and made things right.

Every transaction with your debit card resulted in funds automatically being rounded up to the next dollar and the difference between that amount and the actual transaction transferred to your savings account. As a result, I built a nice savings balance without much effort on my part. I have automatic transfers set up from my checking account to savings, and when it gets to a certain amount I move it to a savings CD. The rate on the CD is much better than that of the regular savings account, but the funds are not as easily accessible. Because of this, I enjoy those options.

I primarily got this bank to obtain a credit card, but I have since moved away from my other bank to solely use this one. I think it has a lot of strengths on its own, but especially in comparison. The interface of the website is friendly, appealing and is functional. Every bit of information I could want from statements, account information, important numbers, and ways to sign up for other programs or open accounts is right there. Customer service is very quick. I have used both the online chat and telephone calls for help with an issue with instant service. I had an issue where I was over drafted for an unauthorized charge and I wasn't aware of it. After using the card a few times, I had an even larger overdraft due to insufficient funds - but all due an unauthorized charge. I called and everything was immediately fixed and smoothed over.Another situation happened that I can't quite remember how it all panned out, but since I had been responsible with that account and the credit account linked, they had given me a benefit for being a good customer. Bank of America has not left me in the dust like my other bank has, and has made it a point to emphasize its appreciation for me being a customer. I don't think customer affirmation is necessarily important, after all I'm being offered a service that is functional, but it makes me feel a lot closer to the bank.Other local things, the hours for the banks meet my needs whenever I need to talk to someone, and I like that I can make deposits through the ATM.

At first we were mainly interested just in the perks of getting the extra bonus sign-up miles, but after our first statement we realized that getting 2 miles for every dollar spent was an excellent perk!

The customer service people are great and I applaud them for their hard work but when it comes to the rates and services they really have changed for the worse.

As a result, I ended up having a late payment on my credit card with them because they would not receive an electronic payment from my student credit union. After having gone to the bank they explained that, had the debit card been stolen, I would not have been liable for any charges against my account but had no explanation for why they would send out another debit card without notifying me.Thankfully it only took one hour of waiting and nearly forty-five minutes speaking with a person inside the bank, something that I am always wary of doing because they are within their rights to charge me for such a service because of how this account is set up, to right the late payment as well.

For the first few months there were no service fees, everything was just how they explained it would be. Then the random service fees- that I was told I would not have to worry about- started. Monthly maintenance fees, fees for not having enough in my account, fees for having too much in my account... I could never keep track, but they were always charging me for something. I ended up getting fed up with their monthly fees so I stopped using my account, only to come back months later and discover they had been tacking on an overdraft fee each time a monthly fee was applied to my account. I had stopped using my account, so I didn't notice this until I was $300+ overdrawn. Thankfully their customer service is not that bad, it was fixed for me and I started using my account again. Then things got really bad. For example oftentimes, transactions would not post right away, so when I checked my account online it would look like I had more money than I did. Once I accidentally overdrew my account by .04 cents, and was charged a $30 overdraft fee. Instead of putting a stop on the card, or at the very least calling/emailing to warn about the card being overdrawn, they would keep adding overdraft fees for each day my account was negative, and each time you used my debit card. Since it looked like the money was in there when I checked my account, I didn't think I was overdrawing my account. Again, customer service was generally pretty understanding the first couple times this happened. But it seemed like no matter how careful I was, I was constantly overdrawn.

I had some odd activity, some my fault and some not, that resulted in NSF fees. They would only partially forgive the ones that were not my fault. I have never asked for fee forgiveness when I was at fault but they did not help me out much at all in that case. The fraud protection can be trying.

When you ask “why does it cost so much?” and the teller responds with “how else do you expect us to make money?”, you get the feeling that service is not at the forefront. I did not have time to explain the banking system and interest to the teller but it probably didn't matter.My checks specifically have increased at least 15% every time I need to replace them. Both checks and cashiers should be free, especially if they are taking the money out of my account on the spot.To be fair, they will try to meet you with a smile at the front desk.

After getting rid of bad credit you do not want to take a ton of credit hits applying for several different cards. This card is pretty much a sure bet for approval but it does come with fees. If rebuilding your credit or starting new credit, it is worth the money to build that new credit. The hits are considered soft hits but they still calculated somehow into your credit. I recently was automatically charged with the annual fee without warning but if you pay attention to to limit, you should not have a problem. On a side note, when I did have credit issues, Bank of America went on the attack despite the fact I have been a customer for at least fifteen years. No mercy was given.

Naturally, I immediately found someone else to finish the A/C work and learned just how dishonest the first vendor was. When I disputed the charge, BoA took their time in reaching out to me and then made me fill out 10pages of information and asked for unreasonable documentation that was impossible to acquire due to the length of time (over a week) passed by then. They wanted a second opinion, on letterhead (not an invoice) detailing the problem and what the original vendor did wrong.A.) The problem had been repaired by then you bureaucratic morons!B.) The second vendor wanted nothing to do with a formal statement on fancy letterhead - that he didn’t even have!In its place, I presented the second invoice AND a notarized affidavit based on the suggestion of the BoA rep.

I put $300 down to secure the line of credit and was told that if I used it and made all of the payments on time and had a zero balance at the year mark, they would graduate it for me and turn it into an unsecured card and I'd get my deposit back. That was in 2013. I applied every year and finally at the beginning of this year, I got my graduation. I have had good credit for the last two of those years. I've never missed a payment and I haven't carried a balance on this card since right before the year mark, so 2014. Every time I've used it since, I have paid it off immediately. When they graduated me, I was approved for a $500 limit and a $39 annual fee, and this card has never had any rewards. I haven't been able to get an increase to save my life and they won't lower the interest rate or remove the fee. I called to ask and they said it was because I have serious delinquencies on my credit. I have two very old accounts in collections that are about to fall off that have not affected my ability to grow my credit score to a beautiful 700+, pick up the American Express every day blue cash card (no annual fee), Chase Sapphire with an $11,000 limit, or the ever difficult to obtain CapitalOne VentureOne card (also with no annual fee) and a $5,000 limit. Clearly I can handle my credit, but I don't know what Bank of America is doing. When I asked them to close my account, they happily said okay. This is funny because just 20 minutes prior, I requested to close my CreditOne card. I feel I have outgrown this card. They fought so hard to keep me with an annual fee refund and the possibility that I'll be able to wipe out some of the features of this card I don't like. More on that in February when I call in and request it, but, I found it a touch disheartening that the Bank of America people didn't even try to keep my business and the really kind of horrible CreditOne people did (the card is horrible, not the people).

At the time the transactions were made, I was at work, and could prove that point, but I spent over a year arguing with Bank of America, before I finally gave up and closed my account.I was also not happy with the amount you could overdraft your account at an ATM.

Overdraft fees used to be a serious concern, because of the way the bank processes them. When I did get hit with fees, they usually racked them up 4 or 5 right on top of each other. Getting them resolved was usually a matter of a simple phone call.At one point I had my information stolen and someone began making unauthorized purchases with my card. Within 12 hours of calling the number I had a new card and every penny of the money that the thief spent was restored in full to my account.Recently I had problems with my credit card, and the bank has been extremely cooperative in helping me resolve my payments. As long as you have a good knowledge of what your payments are and you're working to pay them off (even if not in full), then you will usually find them agreeable to different terms.Overall, I am satisfied with the services I get from my bank, but I would definitely encourage people to read the fine print.

They do have a new “Cash Back Deals” option, which usually has about 5 or so different places you can earn extra cash back. You must go in and select the deals individually though, and then you just make a purchase using the card and it will give you the bonus. They do generally have a balance transfer promotions available, but their fee is usually 4% which is higher than some cards. Another thing that makes them stand out to other cards I have is the “Portfolio” option.

Two more years to go to complete the term in which I taught to have a ZERO balance.Lesson learned, some banks cannot be trusted as they are greedy and will take advantages when possible. The government has now established regulations to punish banks that continue such practices.Be alert with mortgage transactions with Bank of America and those alike.

They were not knowledgeable in the products that inquired about, and were unable to answer my questions regarding my existing account. They responded with apathy. This, and their lack of attentiveness lead me to believe that they did not care, and I was possibly right about my concerns that they were making accounting mistakes. What was interesting is that I experienced almost the same level of customer service across the board. Like I said, that was six years ago.

BoA keeps saying that they are trying to integrate systems which will end these issues but it never happens. It's not a big issue, the problems rarely crop up, but solving their ""integration issue"" doesn't seem to be a priority, despite what I have been told. As a premium account holder I have also tried to have legal documents notarized there once - but they insisted on charging a fee, whereas other banks do that for no cost. It just seemed a typical practice of ""fee creep"" that seems to be rampant at BoA (and other banks to be fair) since 2008.

Comparing Capital One with the San Francisco Giants cards, I think that they are equal on having no annual fee and 0% interest, for one year. The San Francisco Giants card does allow foreign transactions, but the Capital One card does not. If someone wants to travel, the Giants Card might be the way to go instead, even though there is a 3% fee.I like that Capital One gives cash back instead of points. I prefer the $ 100 bonus instead of 100,000 points. Cash is King.For the % rates, I see that the Giants card is higher than the Capital One card. I do not like being nickeled and dimed-ever. In favor of the Giants card, if one likes points, they can earn unlimited points, whereas there is a maximum of 1.5% cashback on the Capital One card. I have never used points. But say I spent 100 for the month. That means I would get back $ 1.50. I am floored. That does not seem at all worth it. But, then again, I do not know how points would outdo this incredible cashback bonus.And the choosing point for me is that you can find out online with the Giants card, but with Capital One.

I wouldn't keep Bank of America so long if they weren't good but I will say that I've had my fair share of issues with this bank. The first thing that bothers me is putting my check on hold. I recently went inside the bank to cash my check on a Friday. I had the check I had received from work and was told that I would have to pay $8.95 because I don't have direct deposit or I can waive the fee and cash it at the ATM. That is really stupid. I come inside the bank because I like the whole experience and they simply ruined that. Another issue is that I get paid a weekly salary plus commission. My checks vary every week and my office doesn't offer direct deposit. I had paid the $8.95 to cash my check and after she had given me a little cash back from that check and the deposit slip said hold on account. I had asked her what that was about and was told she didn't know I would have to call someone at customer service. There was a big problem with that since my rent would be coming out first thing Sat. morning. Eventually after having to be a little ugly to the customer service manager I was able to get the hold removed. I know this review sounds bad but Bank of America is a really good bank and offer a lot of great services. The only thing I would say is they should close a little bit later on Saturdays.

So, for cash deposits I tend to use Bank of America and then funnel that money to USAA. Given my use of this account, I often have a zero-balance. Everything was fine for a few years, but then I got a statement in the mail with a balance of -$10. Turns out they had snuck a change in the terms of the account in a previous statement without my knowing. I accept responsibility for not reading all the fine print every month, but I still find it dishonest to be changing what was marketed as a ""Free Checking Account"" to one that requires a monthly ""service charge"" without making a blatant attempt to notify the consumer. This was done sneakily on purpose to make some money.Having said all that, I was able to go down to the local branch and get it straightened out, but not without pressing the issue more than I should have been required to. A less confrontational customer might not have gotten their money back. For this experience I have to downgrade my overall rating of Bank of America Checking to 2-stars.

It also made it nice to be able to get a hold of him almost at any time to answer all of my (sometimes silly) questions. The only complaint I would have is that there are not many physical brick and mortar branches in my particular area.

I like that I get 1.5x points for all purchases, but I do wish there were certain categories I could get more in. Since I have that for my Freedom though, it didn't bother me too much.

Once Bank of America clears the days transactions over night my balance must be running positive or I am going to receive at least one overdraft fee.Aside from their overdraft fees, recently I learned they have a check cashing fee for anyone who does not have an account with them. In other words if you are holding a check in your hand that is drawn on Bank of America, even if it is a payroll check, you will be charged $6 to cash that check at one of their teller windows.

The rewards, while generous for the first $1500 you spend, are reduced to 1% afterwards. So you get a good positive reinforcement when you first start use card (albeit responsibly, paying off the card on time every month), but then after you end up being like ""where's the cash rewards?"" Also, applying and getting approved for more credit is so easy, it's almost scary.The only complaint I would have is that the card is not travel-friendly. I didn't realize this until I traveled abroad: it does come with a significant fee of about 3% for every international transaction you make. So if you study abroad or travel, I would recommend using a different card, because I racked up about $200 in fees.Overall, a good card for domestic use.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,2,False

At times I forget and then find that I've accumulated enough points for a payout ($25 in rewards in this case), so it's a bit like finding forgotten money lying around the house. I always make sure I completely pay the card off to maintain a good credit score, and because of course interest makes it more expensive in the long run.

The 3-2-1 is definitely cool; however, just as with all credit cards make sure you pay your balance in full otherwise your cash back will be worth nothing. I'm not quite sure how other cash back cards work, but you can only cash out in increments of $25.00. That to me doesn't seem fair as they are offering a reward with a catch.

I try not to use credit cards for those things, but when I have a bad month and have no other options, it's nice to know that I'll at least be getting a portion of it back.The best part is all the options you have for redeeming your rewards. Most card issuers make you redeem for airline tickets, gift cards or lame prizes, but not Bank of America. They give you real, actual CASH back. Once you've accumulated a minimum of $25, you can have your rewards balance transferred to your bank account or request a check.

As a result, we bought much MUCH higher than we should have. Since then, life happened, and we needed to move to something bigger. We put our condo on the market in 2010 and it took nearly 2 years to sell. Now, while we had the mortgage and were living in the condo we had no problems with Bank of America. However, once we tried to sell the condo we ran in to some serious issues. Over the course of 2 years we had 2 people willing to buy our condo above the current market value, but Bank of America was unwilling to do a short sale. Unfortunately, there was no way we could make the monthly payment and there was NO way somebody would be able to pay for the entire mortgage that was left. They seemed unwilling to work with us. We went to a branch to talk to somebody, but the information wasn't passed along to the mortgage department. They were unwilling to work with us until now, and at this time we're working with a representative to complete a final short sale.

For example, my husband and I have separate checking accounts and we are able to quickly and easily make online transfers between each other's accounts with no fees.

We own two houses outright, and our net worth is $1 million plus. We have no debt, and have been banking with BOA for years. My wife also earns $50,000 a year, and teaches for a school district.

Hmmm, so I started reading the fine print following the notice. Ready? It said any approval with less than a $5,000 limit WOULD NOT receive the ‘Signature’ card. Rather, they would be sending the ‘Platinum Plus’ card instead. No bonuses offered under the ‘Signature’ card would be honored. SO, classic ‘BAIT AND SWITCH’ by BOA. I’ve called to get the issue resolved, but as of yet BOA’s only answer was: We can’t disapprove without issuing a lower card …. Or something like that.

I can do without the $12 per month maintenance fee. I'm still trying to understand what it's for and why it's so much when other banks have either done away with the fee or charge way less.

But the negatives outweigh the positives for me: they charge crazy fees for overdraft if you're not protected by linking your checking to your BofA credit card (but even then, the credit card charges you a $10 ""overdraft protection fee""). They also charge foreign transaction fees which is really weird for a bank that's linked to international banks. You're treated more like a number than a customer.

The fee is cheaper than other banks, but it should not cost me $140 dollars a year to maintain a checking account. One of the best perks about Bank of America is the way I can deposit checks. I can just take a check to any Bank of America ATM and directly deposit the check into my account. I don’t need to wait in line for the teller. That is a really nice advantage.

I love having the option of interacting with the banking staff, or doing the banking on my own terms. My account has been overdrawn a couple of times, and I’ve been able to get the fees waived, because of miscalculations on my part. I can honestly say that the staff of Bank of America, really goes the extra mile for their customers. I’ve only been with BOA for about a year and a half, but it’s been my favorite bank to have a checking account with, over all the other big banks that I’ve tried. The debit card comes with extra security, as it offers the patron the choice of having their picture on their card. I personally think that gives my debit card an extra touch of flair.

1310,Joe Weider,12/02/2011,3,"People love personalizing their credit cards. It’s a way to set themselves apart and a reason to smile every time they open their wallets. But the mistake too many people make is sacrificing value for branding. By that I mean if you have to pay more or get less rewards for a credit card just because it has a certain picture or name that plays on your interests, don’t get that card. Unfortunately, this is the case for golfers and the PGA Tour Credit Card. This PGA branded Bank of America credit card requires above-average credit for approval and only offers 1 point for every dollar you spend in return. That’s just not competitive in today’s market, so to use golf lingo, I’d have to say that the PGA Tour Credit Card doesn’t make the cut.The obvious question is if the BofA PGA Credit card won’t be around for the weekend, what card or cards will. If you like traveling to PGA events, a good generic travel rewards card like the Venture from Capital One would be a better choice than the PGA credit card. It offers basically 2% cash back when you redeem miles for travel charges. Anyone who’s been to a PGA tournament recently also knows that having an American express credit card gets you those course vision portable tvs that allow you to see the broadcast feed and keep up with what’s going on with the rest of the field when following a certain group or staying stationed at a particular hole. If I had to pick an Amex card to get instead of the PGA Tour Credit Card, Id go with the Blue Cash Everyday Card because it offers a $100 sign-up bonus (think greens fees) and 3% cash back on purchases made at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores and 1% on everything else. So just call your interest in the PGA Tour Credit Card from Bank of America a mulligan and hit another shot.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,4,False
1311,Joe Weider,12/01/2011,2,"If Jack Bauer tells you to get a credit card, you get it because you sure don’t want to see him mad. Just kidding, but you may recognize the BankAmericard Cash Rewards name from the commercials with Kiefer Sutherland where people are talking about how confusing credit card rewards can be with all the rules and restrictions and how simple their BankAmericard Cash Rewards Cards are in comparison. You have to wonder how accurate that is though. Is the card really good enough to warrant the people in the commercial saying they “love” it? Well it’s important to point out that the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit has changed since these commercials were first run. While simplicity is still the main message, the rewards available with what is now called the BankAmericard Cash Rewards™ Visa Signature® Card - New Cash Rewards and Bonus Offer have progressed from an easy-to-keep-track-of 1% cash back on all purchases to 3% cash back on gas purchases, 2% on groceries and 1% on everything else. This is not the only change made to the Cash Back BankAmericard though. Where there was previously no limit to the rewards you could earn, the 3% on gas and 2% on groceries only apply to the first $1500 you spend in these categories combined. You also get a $50 initial rewards bonus.So it seems like Bank of America is doing the exact things it condemned in its previous advertising. But any problems you might have with the hypocrisy of the situation don’t make the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Visa Signature Card bad. What make it not the best option are the limits and the fact that it is a Visa Signature Card. Most people want simplicity and convenience from their cash rewards and the earning caps with this product add something to worry about. Also Visa Signature Cards have a feature called NPSL, which means you don’t have a set credit limit and that your credit utilization won’t be accurately conveyed to credit bureaus. This can make planning purchases difficult and also hurt your credit score. Anyway, if you want a 1-2-3 rewards card the Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express is better than the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Credit Card because it offers 3% cash back on groceries, 2% on gas station and department store purchases, and 1% on everything else without earning limits or other restrictions. It also has double the initial bonus offered by the BankAmericard Cash Rewards Visa.

1312,Joe Weider,11/28/2011,1,"I suppose “Accelerated Rewards” are those that you earn faster, but one would think that this must be relative to something and highly dependant on your spending habits. The Bank of America Accelerated Rewards Credit Card from American Express can’t have gotten its name from a comparison with other cards that offer a certain cash back rate across all purchases though because it only offers 1.25% cash back while the Capital One Cash Credit Card for example offers 1.5%. And if you spend a lot in certain expense categories, you would certainly earn rewards faster with a card that offers elevated rewards in those particular categories than with the Bank of America Accelerated Rewards American Express Card. Maybe the rewards are accelerated relative to other BofA cards or other Amex cards or maybe the card’s name is just misleading. Whatever the case may be, it’s pretty clear that there are better available options for people with excellent credit.If you want an initial rewards bonus better than the $50 you get with the Accelerated Rewards Credit Card, opt for the Chase Sapphire Preferred. It offers either $625 in travel or $500 in cash. If you want a better base cash back rate, get the previously mentioned CapOne Cash Card. If you want 0% on purchases or transfers, get the Citi Simplicity Card (21 months on both). Like the Accelerated Rewards Credit Card, none of these cards have annual fees during the first year and only the Chase Sapphire Card has one beginning in the second ($95).

This card, like most other alumni cards, is offered by Bank of America and requires good/excellent credit for approval. You might then be expecting some really interesting rewards considering what you can get with good or excellent credit in the traditional rewards and low interest credit card genres, in which case you may be disappointed that this card only gives you one point for each dollar you spend, which can be redeemed for the usual merchandise, travel, gift cards and charitable donations.One would think that BofA would donate a certain percentage of your spending with the OU credit card to the school, allow you to redeem points for unique OU experiences, or provide some other unique perk to explain why this card gets OU branding, but I was unable to find any on either the University of Oklahoma online credit card application or the OU website. I therefore don’t really see the point to getting the OU credit card. In doing so, you would be sacrificing a heck of a lot of rewards potential basically to have the OU logo on your card, which you can do for free if you simply personalize any Capital one credit card.

Cal Berkley’s homecoming is this wknd (Oct. 13-16) and since the nostalgia that comes with traveling back to campus might result in many former students considering applying for the UC Berkley Credit Card, it makes sense to know what you’re getting yourself into.The Cal Alumni Association Platinum Plus® MasterCard® credit card with WorldPoints® rewards--which is issued by Bank of America, requires at least a “good” credit score for approval, and has no annual fee—offers 0% on purchases for 12 months and gives you 1 point/$1 spent, which can be redeemed for travel, merchandise, etc. Unfortunately, after examining the UC Berkley Credit card’s online application, it doesn’t appear that card use automatically results in donations being made to the Cal Alumni Association, which is strange, given that most alumni credit cards are basically charity credit cards. So, for all you Golden Bears looking to give back to the institution that educated you, I recommend getting the best possible cash back credit card because you then have the option to use your rewards for whatever you want, including charitable donations, merchandise, memorabilia, travel, etc.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,2,False

For starters, the Bas Pro Shops credit card is for people with at least good credit and does not have an annual fee, pretty much par for the course for rewards credit cards. Speaking of rewards, it offers 4 points per dollar spent on any purchase of Bass Pro Shop-branded merchandise, 2 points/$1 on purchases made at Bass Pro Shop stores or via the popular fishing and outdoor supply store’s website or catalog, and 1 point for everything else. You also get a $100 gas card, good at any gas station chain, after spending 200 bucks in the first 90 of being a cardholder. This Bas Pro card even offers 0% on purchases for 12 months.That all sounds great on the surface, but the real question should be how this card stacks up against the best rewards cards for good or excellent credit, especially since the rewards you earn with them can be redeemed for a number of things, including cash, travel, dining and merchandise, not ONLY Bass Pro Shop Gift Certificates, as is the case with this card. Well, every 500 points you earn with the Bass Pro Credit Card can be redeemed for $10 in Bass Pro Gift Certificates. Correct me if I’m wrong, but that would seem to make it at worst essentially a Bass-Pro-centric 2% cash back credit card with a decent initial bonus. Not too bad, and while I think I’d still take Capital One’s Cash Credit Card, which offers 1.5% cash back across all purchases, so as not to push myself into a corner as far as rewards redemption, it should work well for any of the Tigers or any Bass Pro fanatics out there.

1316,Joe Weider,10/03/2011,4,"It occurred to me just the other day that air travel and a credit card that rewards you for such aren’t necessarily the only ways to get to a Yankees playoff game this fall and lower the cost of doing so. There are, of course, other modes of transportation, so I decided to take a look at the Amtrak Credit Card to see what kind of perks it offers. First of all, this card requires at least good credit, so if you don’t have a good or excellent credit score, don’t bother applying for the Amtrak Card or reading further. If you do, the Amtrak credit card doesn’t have an annual fee and offers a base rewards earning rate of one point per dollar spent, 2 points per dollar spent on Amtrak purchases, 5% of your points back every time you redeem and, perhaps most importantly for saving in the short term, 18,000 bonus points after you make your first purchase. Seeing as you can get a regular coach fare class ticket for 3,000 points, a business class fare for 8,000 points and your own bedroom on an overnight train for 20,000 points, that seems like a pretty good deal. So, if you want to take advantage of this card’s attractive initial bonus or you frequently travel with Amtrak and want to effectively lower the cost of this expense, why not add the Amtrak Card to your rewards credit card collection? I would not make this card your main rewards credit card though because you can find a cash back credit card like the Capital One Cash Card that will be both less hassle and more lucrative, given the 1.5% cash back it provides across all purchases.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,0,False
1317,Joe Weider,09/28/2011,5,"So, in the latest installment of my little credit card review series (it’s turning into a series, but really I just research and write about credit cards when I’m bored because I’m weird and find it interesting) I touched on the fact that you can find a rewards credit card related to basically any niche interest you may have—even your favorite sports team. And with the Yankees having recently clinched the AL East as well as home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, which are set to begin in just a few days, I thought, “Why don’t I see what credit card companies are doing to reward the greatest baseball fans on the planet?”.Unfortunately, the answer is that we don’t get bonus rewards just for being Yankees fans. Bank of America does offer this Major League Baseball credit card, which you can personalize with your favorite team’s logo, but the basic rewards earning rate (1 point/$1 spent), bonus rewards (10,000 bonus points after at least $250 in purchases post to your account within 90 of becoming a cardholder), and special perks (20% off on MLB shop purchases and the ability to redeem points for merchandise and memorabilia) are the same regardless of whether you root for Jeter and the boys or the lowly Baltimore Orioles.

1319,Joe Weider,09/27/2011,5,"Ok, so I’ve been interested in credit cards for a long time, particularly those that offer rewards, because I think it’s interesting that you can save or get free stuff just by making a purchase with one piece of plastic as opposed to another. I’ve just recently started exploring this interest in depth though, and the sheer extent of the rewards credit card market and the seemingly countless different types of cards targeted to niche interests and tied to various companies has amazed me. I mean if you want a card tied to your school’s alumni association, it’s there. If you want one that shows your support for a sports team (Go Yanks and Giants!), take your pick. You can even get a card that gives auto insurance rewards.Take this AAA Cash Rewards Credit Card, for example. It gives you 2% cash back on AAA travel purchases, purchases made at AAA retailers and AAA Mid-Atlantic Insurance Group premiums as well as 1% on everything else and doesn’t have an annual membership fee. While I wouldn’t recommend using this card as your main rewards credit card given that a card like the Capital One Cash Card offers 1.5% on all purchases and it certainly doesn’t meet my particular needs, it could make a good addition to your rewards card collection if you have AAA insurance and spend a couple grand on AAA-related purchases per annum. After all, I really see the value in having a few different rewards credit cards tied to specific interests. This allows you to get the maximum market rewards value on every purchase category and save as much as possible.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,1,False

BOA chooses to process debits, then credits to each account, in that order. Meaning, if you deposit money to cover a charge when your balance is close to 0 (to post on the same day as the debit), you will definitely get charged an over limit fee, because they charge the debit, you go below 0, then they apply the credit to your account, then they take out their fee.I have talked to a couple of CSRs about this issue and no one is helpful.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,2,False

They have constantly changed account standings, settings, and issue fees even though my account was well above the threshold for these. This required me to have a monthly call with BoA to get them to refund the fees and each time I was told that it would not happen in the future but that it is the ""systems call"" whether or not changes and fees are issued; in other words, you will be charged a fee regardless of whether or not your account meets the minimum requirements for the fees to be waived. It seems that the ""system"" does this simply to be an inconvenience to you - each time I called the BoA customer service I have had to wait 15+ minutes on the phone and the callback feature does not work often either.I also have a Small Business Account with BoA; again, it more than meets the minimum requirements for all fees to be waived, yet each month I am charged a fee which I have to call to get reimbursed. I have made in-person meetings at my local branch, and while the agents have been very helpful, it seems that they don't entirely know how the BoA system works. This is surprising as they were unable to answer some of my basic questions, including why the system charges fees when the account is above the threshold.Overall, after 8+ years I have had enough of poor customer service where each agent says something different and seemingly no one understands how the system works and I have had enough of a broken system that charges its users fees regardless of whether or not they meet the threshold for the fees to be waived. Since I will be leaving BoA, I will be pulling my Small Business Account and have also had my partners and employees switch to the other bank where our Small Business Account moved to.

Once I figured out what was going on I immediately notified my branch and the associates were amazing even helping me to find the necessary information so that I could file a police report for check fraud. Not so amazing was the fact that Bank of America's credit card division realized this blatant act of check fraud and refused to talk to me regarding the issue. I'm still waiting to get my money back and change my account while the police report is being investigated. I love Bank of America's checking support, but I would think twice about their credit card offers after this experience.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,2,False

It was free so long as you used direct deposit. Having said that, if you are a teacher, like me and don't get paid over the summer expect to be charged the two months you are not getting the deposits. You can call, explain and they fix it but it will happen every summer because no one at Bank of America communicates with any other department and they don't pay attention to your information unless you OWE them money.

I was not contacted in any manner to alert me to a problem. I found out when I went to pay a bill after my pay was automatically deposited.

There are so many BOA's around that no matter where you go, an ATM is just right around the corner. Third, they supply me with all the free checks that I could ever need, and a personalized debit card with my picture on it so I can't be defrauded.

I called the company within a couple of days, and by June 9th, there was a credit on my account for these two charges and a fraud investigation had been started. My card was canceled and a new card was sent out to me. On July 8th, 2020 the credits were reversed. The company sent me a letter telling me that the orders from these services came from my device and that they match my previous account activity. I reached out to DoorDash who confirmed this was fraud, and they refunded me $36.12. I also contacted MenuStar who confirmed that the transaction was fraud, but all they need is for BOA to reach out to them notifying them that a fraud claim was submitted. The bank doesn't want to contact the vendor for some reason, and therefore I'm stuck with the amount of $57.55. I am still in possession of the card that was used, so I was not negligent in any way. Somehow these criminals got a hold of my card, and I don't want to finance their food or lifestyle. Bank of America needs to make this right. They have a $0 liability guarantee which should be applied in this scenario. I get an e-mail from Vernon White who never answers his phone or returns my calls to confirm my complaint with the CFPB. This avoidance is totally unethical and a way for BOA to work around the CFPB. At this point this is impacting my credit score, and it's not okay.

I wouldn't have minded staying a customer, but I was really turned off after being told that I would be charged a fee for not maintaining a minimum average balance of $1500.

If you have cashed a check, the issuer can reclaim the check as if it were a fraud and file a claim. The issuer can file a claim up until two years is what I was told by the BofA agent. Meaning issuer can re-cash the already cleared check anytime in the next two years. BofA's claims department has the leverage of debiting that amount from your checking account without notifying you or at least they say they tired to reach you, which is false. My account has an email id, and they could have notified me via email. The bank has authorized the claims and XXX $ was debited from my checking account. Which ideally means, our accounts are an open book. I fought real hard, and all they have to say is I have to contact the issuer, and they will not help me. But they will take my money without my permission. How Convenient.

This was the last straw so we are leaving the bank with our familes...Bank of america lost a lot of money and we have had nothing but troubles with them not keeping track of accounts. We have had several incidents where Money was overdrafted due to processing then fixed and having to fight them for their automated crap. Due to them not giving money on direct deposits from Amazon for a day or so we would wind up missing bills. They would tell us we could do nothing but wait for them to resolve disputed charges where some reason it was rang up twice for food. We would pay a 5 dollar safe checking fee on my account not my husbands to never have to worry about overdrafts and they would still do overdrafts. We called on multiple days, sat with several physical Tellers, managers, and supervisors, and even made them get on a three way merge call with my grandmother's bank for the current check having issues through them which is one of those checks you have to buy with money and is considered cash. It is very dissatisfying that our honeymoon was cut short due to the bank being unjust and not resolving or being able to verify over the phone when they had all these simple solutions they should have been able to do without their clunky software and locks. We did talk to several other banks who said that they can do that since each bank has its own policies but most banks would have had the money resolved since its been technically 4 days now. Due to all these issues we decided to pull our money and go to an alternative bank. Our families are doing the same which means they lost way more money then they anticipated.On a positive note the application process is not bad and I didn't have much issues when i got my gender change with them changing the info and changing account types. They do try to keep you safe and lock accounts for activity that feels different from what they usually see but its all mostly automated. Sucks when you need to wait an hour for it to unlock again due to the fact that it autolocked from buying from a different store, site, or in a different state than it is usually active.

Now they have the fewest and farthest between when it comes to amount of locations. They clearly are taking advantage of customers and closing locations to recoup losses.

When I contacted customer service they were useless and said there was nothing they could do and never returned my money.

I was asking for a HELOC for only 60% of the value on a home worth 1M that I don't owe anything on so they'd be in 1st position as a lender. I own my cars, my boat and another home outright. This should be a slam dunk for them, right? I got all the info they requested in right away. I was supposed to get a call by Monday. I didn't. I called to follow up and they said it would be by Friday. They finally called on Saturday. The person said I need to supply a P&L statement. I explained that I sent them my 2019 return that was filed less than 30 days ago and according to their own guidelines, that should be sufficient. She insisted anyway. Fine. Then I log in to upload my dad-blame P&L statement they needed so desperately (less than one week after asking for it) and it says my application is no longer being processed and gives a # to call where you get a voice mail to leave a message. I haven't got an email, phone call or anything telling me this and wouldn't have known if I hadn't logged in.

This is Bank of America's basic checking product, and I wouldn't really recommend it except that Bank of America is everywhere and has some nice features: $10 ATM machines, instant deposit of checks from the store-branch ATMs, 100 instant credit to your account from the deposit.The downsides: it is basically nearly impossible to avoid the monthly $12 fee. This account also used to be notorious for obscene overage charges, but changes to banking law since 2010 have made this account less obnoxious - in that you can turn the overdraft ""feature"" off now so your debit card will bounce if you can't cover the cost. Prior to this, every overage would be charged $35, even if you say, went over by .5 cents.Also, the cost to refill your paper checkbook is astoundingly $35. For paper checks!The meh: Bank of America is heinously zealous about protecting you from identity theft. Which is great - unless you travel a lot. On multiple occasions I have informed BoA of my travel plans only to have them shut down my account once I'm on the trip. Doesn't matter where you go - it happened once in Denver and once in Paris.

1620,Joe Weider,03/06/2012,2,"There’s no question that the ASPCA is a great cause. In case you didn’t know, ASPCA stands for The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and as a big time animal lover (especially dogs!), I’m all for giving them as much dough as possible. But is the ASPCA Credit Card the right tool with which to do so. In other words, how do the ASPCA Credit Card’s rewards compare to other credit cards that require good or excellent credit for approval. While charity credit cards automatically send donations to their affiliated organization, most credit cards give you the option of donating rewards earnings and even if they don’t, you can simply donate the cash gleaned from a credit card rewards program yourself. Your goal, after all, is providing the ASPCA with the most money possible. So, starting with rewards, the ASPCA Rewards Card offers 3% cash back on gas and 2% cash back on groceries up to $1,500 spent in these categories quarterly as well as 1% on everything else. You also get a 10% cash back bonus when you redeem rewards earnings into a Bank of America bank account. Unfortunately, though, the ASPCA Card does not appear to have anything to do with the ASPCA other than branding. BofA, the card’s issuer, doesn’t seem to donate any portion of card sales to the organization and your rewards aren’t automatically donated or anything else. While the ASPCA Rewards Credit Card offers decent rewards overall, there are better cards out there. The same holds true for its rates; the ASPCA Card only gives you 0% on purchases for 12 months and does not offer a low intro rate on balance transfers.So alternatives are in order. If you want to give a lot to the ASPCA in the short term, the Chase Sapphire Card is the way to go since it offers a $500 initial bonus. Depending on your spending habits, the Capital One Cash Rewards Card (1.5% cash back across all purchases) or the Blue Cash Everyday from Amex (3% at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores and 1% everywhere else with no earning limit) are great options for ongoing donations. The good thing about getting a Capital One Card is that you can customize the entire front of your card with a picture of your choosing, which means you can turn any Capital One Card into a makeshift ASPCA Card if you so choose. Finally, if you want to get low rates, the No Balance Transfer Slate Card is the best choice.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,1,False
1621,Joe Weider,02/29/2012,3,"Chicago Cubs fans need all of the rewards they can get, considering how much heart break they’ve had to deal with over the years. But is the team’s co-branded credit card they way to get these rewards. I certainly get wanting to have a credit card bearing my favorite teams logo, but you do not want to sacrifice your card’s terms just for branding, especially when you consider the fact that you can put any picture you want on the front of any Capital One credit card. So, we have to figure out whether the Chicago Cubs Credit Card is competitive, branding aside. Starting with rewards, the Cubs Credit Card gives you 3% cash back on gas, 2% on groceries, and 1% cash back across all other purchases. That’s actually not too bad, especially in light of the fact that you get a 10% cash back bonus when you redeem your cash back into a Bank of America savings account (Bank of America issues the Cubs Rewards Card). Moving onto rates, the Chicago Cubs Rewards Credit Card offers 0% on purchases as well as balance transfers for 12 months. That’s not as good as you might think since cards are available that offer 0% for as long as 18 months. Besides, the Cubs Credit Card charges a 4% balance transfer fee, whereas most other cards only charge 3% and some don’t charge anything. Finally, the Cubs Rewards Credit Card requires good or excellent credit for approval and does not charge an annual fee.Ultimately, the Cubs Credit Card is decent and it wouldn’t be a bad choice for those looking for everyday rewards, particularly if you have a BofA savings account or can open one. Still, I would consider a few other cards before applying for the Cubs Card. The Blue Cash Everyday from Amex offers 3% at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on everything else. The Capital One Venture Card offers basically 2% cash back across all purchases if you redeem miles for anything travel-related. The Chase Sapphire Preferred also gives you an initial bonus worth $500-625. I would not get the Cubs Rewards Card if I want low rates. Instead, I’d go with the Chase Slate Card or the Discover More Card that offers 0% on purchases and transfers and does not charge an annual fee.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,2,False

1623,Joe Weider,02/09/2012,2,"If you’ve flown with Asiana Airlines before, you might be interested in/have been solicited about getting the Asiana Airlines Credit Card. So, is it a good idea? That depends. It depends first of all on how often you travel and how often you travel with Asiana Airlines. Credit cards affiliated with specific airlines are only really worth it for people who fly a few tens of thousands of miles with the respective airline each year. If you only fly with Asiana once in a while, you won’t be able to redeem the rewards you earn with the Asiana Credit Card frequently enough to benefit as much as one’d like to from their rewards card or sufficiently reduce the chances of miles depreciation. I’m guessing this advice will knock out a significant number of people, but if you’re still interested, the next thing you need to think about is what the Asiana Airlines Card offers. The answer is that it gives you 5,000 bonus miles after your first purchase, 2 miles per $1 spent on Asiana Airlines tickets and at select grocery stores (very unusual), an annual $100 rebate on Asiana airlines tickets (largely offset by the Card’s $80 annual fee), and one miles for every $1 you spend on everything else. So, to return to the original question, is the Asiana Airline Credit Card worth getting? I’d say no, simply because of the other very attractive travel credit cards out there.For example, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card offers an initial bonus that gives you $625 toward airfare and hotel accomodations for spending $3,000 in the first three months. The Capital One Venture Card also offers an intial bonus that gives you $100 in travel and the card basically acts as a 2% cash back credit card across all purchases as long as you redeem miles for travel related purchases. Because these two cards are both more lucrative than the Asiana Air Credit Card and allow you logistical variety as far as what airline you take (even what mode of transportation you want to travel with), they are better choices.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,3,False
1624,Joe Weider,01/06/2012,2,"With one Brown alum just taking over for another as Penn State’s head football coach (Bill O’Brien for Joe Paterno) the Brown University name is in the news (the sports news at least) quite a bit – not to mention the fact that Chris Berman mentions the school every chance he gets. It wouldn’t be surprising if this little reminder led some of you former Bears to check out the Brown University Alumni Credit Card. But you shouldn’t just apply for the Brown Credit Card because you went there. The general rule of thumb for affinity credit cards is that you should not overpay or waste potential just for a name, a picture or other branding. So if the Brown University Credit Card is competitive, you may want to apply for it, but if it’s not, maybe just go get a sweatshirt or something and show your allegiances that way. Let’s get right to evaluating what this card has to offer then. Basically all it gives you is 1 point for each dollar you spent and 0% on purchases for 12 months. That’s clearly not competitive when you consider that you need excellent credit to get it and the excellent credit market is robust at the moment.You need alternatives then. The exact recommendations I would make differ based on your needs. If you need a way to save on interest, go with either the Citi Platinum Select, Diamond Select or Preferred because all of them offer 0% on purchases and transfers for 21 months. Rewards seekers have a lot of options and which route they take depends on spending habits, but some of my favorite rewards cards are the Capital One Venture Card, the Capital One Cash Credit Card, and the Chase Sapphire Preffered. The cool thing about capital one cards is that you can pout whatever picture you want on your card for free, so you could basically turn any of them into a Brown University Credit Card of sorts.

1625,Joe Weider,12/21/2011,5,"Yesterday for my little credit card review, I went down to Mexico with the AeroMexico Credit Card. Today, we’re goin the opposite direction with the Alaska Airlines Credit Card. First of all there are two types of people who should consider the Alaska Airlines Credit Card. People who want to take a trip to Alaska or one of Alaska Airlines’ other destinations and could use an initial rewards bonus offering a couple free flights and those who fly Alaska Airlines on the reg, as Kenny Powers would say. I'm not saying this card is good for either group, but the point is that not everyone can benefit from the Alaska Airlines Credit Card. Whether these groups even can depends on what it offers. First of all, the Alaska Airlines Credit Card gives you 25,000 bonus miles upon approval. It also provides a $99 companion ticket discount code whenever you book a flight through Alaska Airlines or Horizon Air. There’s also the 3 miles per $1 spent on those two airlines and 1 mile per $1 spent on retail purchases.In reality it appears that the Alaska Airlines Credit Card is really only good for one group. People looking for an initial bonus won’t find much here, and considering that cards like the Chase Sapphire Preferred offer $625 in travel accommodations on any airline or at any hotel, something like that would both be more lucrative and provide more flexibility. The Alaska Airlines Credit Card is a fine choice for frequent Alaska Airlines flyers though, especially if you travel with family.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,2,False
1626,Joe Weider,12/20/2011,2,"Are you a AAA member? If not, you shouldn’t even consider the AAA Rewards Credit Card. If so, it really depends how lucrative this card is compared to the rest of the above-average credit rewards credit card market. The AAA rewards credit card offers the standard 1 point per dollar spent on all purchases in addition to 2 point per dollar spent on gas, grocery and drug store purchases, and 3 points per dollar on AAA purchases, including travel. That’s about it. The 2.99% intro balance transfer rate for 12 months isn’t a perk since it comes with a 4% transfer fee and there are cards out there that offer 0% for 21 months with a 3% fee.Ultimately, it only seems like you should open the AAA Rewards Card if you spend a lot through AAA each month. I mean, the Capital One Venture Card basically offers 2% cash back on all purchases if you redeem miles for anything travel related. The Blue Cash Everyday from Amex offers 3% cash back at grocery stores, 2% at gas stations and department stores and 1% on everything else. The Citi Simplicity and Platinum Select credit cards offer 0% on purchases and transfers for 21 months. There are simply no shortage of cards that are better than the AAA Rewards Credit Cards for all but the biggest AAA spenders.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,1,False
1627,Joe Weider,12/14/2011,3,"There are a few different BankAmericard Visas, so I guess the BankAmericard Visa Card is the plain vanilla version since it doesn’t have the words “Cash Rewards,” “Fully Secured,” “Signature,” etc. attached to its name. The question though is whether its terms are plain vanilla or as exciting as something like Reece’s ice cream. The BankAmericard Visa Credit Card doesn’t offer rewards (strike 1?) but it does offer 0% on both transfers and purchases for the first 15 months, though it charges a 4% balance transfer fee while most cards with balance transfer offers have 3% fees (strike 2?). Sure, the BankAmericard Visa Card doesn’t have an annual fee, but it requires excellent credit and many other cards with the same approval criteria don’t have such fees either or offer way, way better rewards. I can now say it definitively, Stike 3. The BankAmericard Visa Card just doesn’t cut it in the current credit card market.You need to explore some alternatives then, and what type of card you concentrate on depends on your spending and payment habits. If you have trouble paying your monthly bills in full, you’ll want a card like the Citi Simplicity Card, which offers 0% on purchases and transfers for 21 months. If you want a card with good rewards across all purchases, the Capital One Cash Credit Card, with its flat 1.5% cash back rate is a good choice. If you want a rewards bonus, go for the Chase Sapphire Preferred and it’s $500 - $625 initial bonus. If you want more rewards on specific spending categories, a card like the Blue Cash Everyday from Amex, with its 3% cash back at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on everything else is a good choice, but this obviously depends on your lifestyle. Ultimately, you’d have to try hard not to do better than the BankAmericard Visa Card.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,2,False
1628,Joe Weider,12/09/2011,4,"Most anyone who’s a fan of racing and the number 88 car would want the Kid’s name and branding on their credit card. But before ya submit an application for the Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Credit Card you should see if all that would cost you anything. The Dale Jr. Credit Card doesn’t have an annual fee, so you’re clear on that front and there’s no special fee for getting Junior’s name and number on your card, but by getting this card it does appear that’ll you’ll be sacrificing in terms of rewards and interest rates. The Dale Earnhardt, Jr. Credit Card requires good or excellent credit for approval, but only gives you one point for every dollar spent, a 0% purchase APR, and a $25 store credit to Nascar.com in return.When it comes to initial bonuses, you can get $625 in travel or $500 in cash with the Chase Sapphire Credit Card after spending $3k in the first 3 months. In terms of the regular rewards earning rate, you can get 1.5% across all purchases with the Capital One Cash Credit Card and 3% at supermarkets, 2% at gas stations and department stores, and 1% on everything else with the Blue Cash Everyday Card from American Express (and those are just examples). Looking at rates, you can get 0% on transfers and purchases for 21 months with the Citi Simplicity Card. You also get a 7.25% - 13.25% variable APR with the Iberia Bank Visa Classic Credit Card, which is better than the 12.99% - 20.99% you get with the Dale Earnhardt Junior Credit Card.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,4,False
1629,Joe Weider,12/08/2011,5,"The BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature Card just sounds cool. But the coolest thing about rewards credit cards is saving money, so we need to see how cool the Power Rewards really are. Let’s see, you get a $50 statement credit after making $100 in retail purchases in the first 60 days after account opening. (That’s better than nothing, but $50 is a little small for an initial rewards bonus in the current market, and the whole forcing you into a statement credit and adding the retail purchase requirement to the deal takes away from its attractiveness). The Power Rewards BankAmericard also offers 3 points per $1 spent on gas, grocery and drug store purchases during the first 6 months (this might’ve been a better deal like 5 months ago when gas prices are high, but at least right now it’s not that great). The 1 point per $1 base earning rate is pretty standard, but the fact that it appears to be all you get after the first 6 months isn’t thrilling. Then we get to the issue of the BankAmericard Power Rewards Card being a Visa Signature card. This is important because Visa Signature cards have a feature called No Preset Spending Limit. This means your credit limit will be determined on a monthly basis and you’ll never know quite what it is. It also means that your credit utilization might be reported inaccurately to the credit bureaus and your credit score could fall for no good reason.You should then consider options in the place of the BankAmericard Power Rewards Visa Signature Card. The Chase Sapphire Preferred is a good choice if you want a lucrative initial bonus. The Capital One Cash Credit Card or Venture Card are nice choices for earning ongoing rewards. And if you were drawn to the Power Rewards Bank of America card for the 0% it offers on purchases or balance transfers for the first 12 months, then the Citi Simplicity card (0% on both for 21 months) or the Citi Dividend World MasterCard (0% on purchases for 15 months and some interesting rewards) would both be better choices than the Bankamericard Power Rewards Credit Card.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,3,False

A 25 day grace period is nice, in case you are having trouble paying on time but that APR can get a little high. Personally, I would never use a card that could shoot up to almost 23% after a year. The smart chip is an essential tool to have in a new card so I do like that. Again, I would never take out a cash advance with a 15% fee.

The fee can be waived if you maintain a daily $300 balance. The whole point of having a savings account is to save money, so I don’t know why you need to pay to save your money.

My next goal is to open an interest bearing checking account and BOA has some good options for those. I’m very happy with BOA for my personal banking and my savings account.

To make matters worse, I had sent in a significantly large payment and after receiving it, they cut my credit down by 25%, again offering me no reason why when I asked. I do still have the card and they did manage to do one thing that showed me that Bank of America isn't totally heartless. I live in New York and was effected by Hurricane Sandy. When I went to pay my bill last month and I had no payment due. I called them and they told me that they waived all payments for people in the areas that Sandy hit.

I will say that Bank of America's customer service was always great and I knew that they were just doing their job when it came down to all the regulations.

Because of this I stay with bank of america.Over the years I've taken my investments (IRAs, CDs, etc) elsewhere for higher rates and would not pursue anything other than a business loan with them but they will always have my business for their branch customer service.

Another nice thing is that you also get some rewards points from getting your car fixed, talk about awesome! This card has some foreign fees if you travel abroad but it still allows purchases out of the US as well.

I mainly used the account to save my money and order the occasional item online.

I went into a branch and tried to figure out what happened, but no one could tell me, they just said I had to pay them and get my account back in good standing. I didn’t have the money to do so, and two days later, three more overdraft fees on the overdraft fees came through.

They refuse to stop drafting money automatically and they won't apply it to my mortgage. I am considering some legal options in dealing with them. They hang up on me after I am on hold for hours, keep transferring me to someone else or assign me a case ID number, and then do absolutely nothing about it.

The policy that I have the biggest issue with is overdraft fees. It doesn't make sense to me that if I overdraw my checking account by $1 that I will be charged $35 instantly. If I sign up for overdraft protection it links my checking account to a credit card, charging the card $100, and putting $100 in my checking account. If you miss paying off your card expect to pay high interest rates. I eventually canceled my overdraft protection due to the fees and running up cash advance charges on my credit card (which I have thankfully been able to pay off). On top of protection fees the monthly maintenance fees that they charge me for not keeping a minimum balance ($2,500 is a little much for me right now) are ridiculous. I am currently paying a $12 monthly maintenance fee on my checking and $5 a month for my savings. I have just about finished switching to PNC Bank which has a much better online banking system / app offerings than Bank of America. PNC also has mobile deposits, owns all of Wawa's ATMs, and doesn't charge any fees for their checking/saving/growth account they provide with their Virtual Wallet Service.

Nevertheless...If Spirit actually flies to your desired destinations, then you just need to understand how to utilize the rules to your benefit.First of all, if you are husband and wife (or any travel pair), you can get 35K bonus miles (which is 15K for person #1, 15K for person #2 and 5K for person #1 referring person #2).Detroit - Cancun roundtrip offpeak is 5,000 miles per person whereas a typical ticket is $300 - $400 per person. Do the math and decide when to pay in miles and when to pay in cash.Secondly, your miles have the most value when you use them off-peak. Look at the off-peak schedule and travel only during that time (if possible).You can also get partial savings. We booked a one-way to Punta Cana on a particular day using miles and a return flight on another airline using cash and the net cost is less than a roundtrip ticket using cash. Again, do the math!Thirdly, be mindful of the rules. Use your card at least once a month, if only for a $5 purchase at McDonalds.There is no downside to the card. There may be downside to Spirit Airlines in terms of customer service (sometimes) and charges for everything they deem extra - which is everything.

If you have 50K points but only spent 100 of your card purchases on travel, you can only use 10K of your points for travel reimbursement. Also, this card only REIMBURSES travel- and that can be a pain. (See reviews by others below. Travel charges on the card, which are 'covered by points'- you end up paying interest on the charges during the delay period before BoA gets around to reimbursing you for your travel purchase. Big costly whammy there!)Also BoA I haven't tried this yet- but I have another BoA card- regular ""BoA Rewards'. My travel rewards card only REIMBURSES for travel services- and I hear there are costly problems with that. (See reviews below from others.) The regular 'Rewards' card has 'concierge travel service'- where you pay for the travel WITH your points directly.A customer service rep told me I could accumulate 1.5 points per purchase on my BoA Travel Rewards card (the 'regular' rewards card only gives 1 point per dollar charged, so that's not cost-effective) but that I could then TRANSFER the accumulated Travel Reward Card point over to the Regular Rewards card, (with no loss of points) and use my regular BoA rewards card to book travel through the BoA (regular) Rewards card Concierge Desk- and that way the points on the old card's Concierge desk- will pay for the travel costs directly with the accumulated points- no waiting and paying interest on reimbursements.It might not work- it was a suggestion from a rep, I haven't tried it yet. OR it could be that the prices are higher on the Concierge Desk than booking directly- or that might not be the case but - transferring the 1.5 points accumulation on the Travel Rewards BoA card to a regular BoA rewards card might be a solution to all the costly problems people have using the Travel Rewards points or getting them reimbursed.",Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,female,3,False

Bank of America offers that one on one individual appreciation which Iâve always encountered at my local branch with the backing of a big name behind it. The customer service is outstanding and at my local branch in Grand Rapids, Michigan a couple of the tellers even know me by name.My interest was first aroused with Bank of America through their exquisite student checking that they offer for students. If I signed up for an account I would get a $100 cash offer which would be deposited into my account after six weeks (and it was.) Free money is always good! Bank of America offers a great overall eBanking but the one for their students as well as the free money that I got is what sealed the deal for me. My student eBanking includes free transfers which is great!!!! I can easily transfer money between my Bank of America account to my PayPal account. I love buying and selling things on eBay and this transfer makes the process so much easier especially since the transfers are always free. That is a really rarity in banking. Iâm also an Economics major and Iâve got a free MyPortfolio that comes with my account which has been both fun and a learning experience. I get to play with the financial market and stock options, which will be crucial in my future.The customer service is unrivaled. Iâve never banked with any other institutions so I cannot compare Bank of America to other banks but I can base their customer service on other companies that Iâve dealt with and I can honestly say that the representatives at Bank of America are concerned about their customers. Iâve never had any bad incidents where a teller or a representative was short with me. Iâve always walked out satisfied. Theyâve also got a great phone system and the representatives are just as friendly!Bank of America probably has just about as many ATMâs around as Chase Bank. An abundance of ATMâs is a big plus for me. I travel back and forth between Chicago and Grand Rapids a lot. I never carry cash with me so stopping at an ATM is almost a daily thing for me. Since there are so many Bank of America ATMâs around, I rarely have to use another ATM which charges outrageous fees just to withdraw money.I would recommend Bank of America to anyone but particularly students.

Of course the biggest specific advantage for me is that I have AAA auto insurance and there are a couple of benefits that this gives with regards to travel and retail purchases from AAA.

I had really poor credit (low 500s) and had decided that I really needed to change my habits and start rebuilding. The way I looked at this card was a chance to rebuild NOT as a card with any perks. I hadn’t earned that right. I knew I didn’t want one of those “bad credit” cards where they approve you for $300, but your initial available credit was like $175!!After a year of responsible use and on time payments, I called customer service to ask about limit increases. Here is what I was told, and this seems to be different than what I’m reading from others. I should note that I’m also a BOA banking customer, I’m not sure if criteria differs based on that fact. Anyway, I was told I can make deposits (in $100 increments) and that was the only way to increase my limit on a secured card. Also that I couldn’t request graduation to an unsecured card but that it would be periodically evaluated. I will say they were very unclear when these evaluations take place.Earlier this year I decided to start making deposits to increase my available credit, while also keeping my usage low. I increased the limit to $700.Within 6months of making those deposits, they were returned (all $700) to my checking acct and my limit was increased to $1700. I had finally been graduated to an unsecured card after almost 2 years (yes, I called them to confirm this). This has been a slow process but that was a rewarding moment. I’m going to wait a little longer and then apply for a card for above average creditMy only question is, if I had started making those additional deposits a long time ago would my card have been graduated sooner? Could just be coincidence though.

1879,Christopher Hopper,09/02/2013,5,I like the BankAmericard Visa Card. It was my first card I got when I was enrolled in college. They gave me a high credit limit and a low interest rate. I built my credit up over the last three years through using this card to pay my monthly phone bill. The payment method every month is very simple if you have a Bank of America Checking Account. You can simply transfer money to the credit card account to pay it off every month without a fee being charged. That's incredibly helpful and convenient if you are a student. Another plus is that their customer service is always top notch and I have always had my questions answered promptly and accurately when I inquire about billing and payments.,Bank of America Credit Cards,wallethub.com,male,0,False
1880,Mike Hogg,12/26/2012,2,"When I set up my small business 2 years ago and required banking support, I first looked into going with Bank of America rather than my local credit union (which we used for personal banking), as the impression was that for business purposes it was always best to go with a big bank. Unfortunately, they made it quite clear early on that small business is of no interest to them. My online application was held up for weeks as they could not physically comprehend that someone here as a legal resident would want to set up their own business. E-mailed documentations were lost, I had to speak to a different person each time and no details ever seemed to have been saved on their computers when I called. The worst part was that each time it just seemed like the person I was speaking to didn't care and I was just another annoyance to deal with before getting out the door at 5pm. I gave up in the end and used the Credit Union and have had no problems.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,2,False

I have heard a lot of people speak negatively about them, and telling us about the problems they have had. However, we have never had an issue. My wife recently had her debit card stolen, and a ton of charges racked up on it. BoA was swift and appropriate in their handling of the case. Even though it was her checking account, and it was severely in the negative, they allowed her to spend her money as usual until the claim was processed. We both have checking, savings, debit, and credit through BoA. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a new bank. I like that they have good weekend hours that a lot of banks don't have. They have a great iPhone app to manage accounts, deposit checks via a picture taking program, and transfer money around. I always get friendly customer service in person, and I like that the new banks are getting away from the glass walls between you and the tellers, as it seems more personal now.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,2,False
1882,Krystal B,12/26/2012,4,"I have been a Bank of America customer for about 2 years. I am satisfied with the company. At first, I had a regular personal checking account. Then, I switched to the online/ATM only account because I no longer had direct deposit so I could avoid fees. This means that as long as I conduct all of my business online, on the phone or via ATM, I don't pay any checking account fees. However, I wish they had straight “free checking” like some other banks. I’ve chosen Bank of America over other banks because they have so many locations and ATMs available so that makes it convenient to do business with them. They offer good promotions. I am a member of the Keep the Change program whereby every time I make a purchase, the “change” goes into my savings account and my savings account grows that way. They had a program whereby they would match whatever I put in but I still have not received my “match” from them. They can be slow in fulfilling their promises in that way. However, whenever I have had a dispute with a merchant, they have promptly refunded my account and assisted in the situation. I opened my account online so it is easy to open an account with them. Every time I have visited a branch or emailed or called them, their associates are always kind, friendly, polite and helpful. They have a free VISA check card with their checking accounts which is great because VISA is accepted everywhere and I can shop just like having a credit card. Their online banking website is secure and easy to use. All in all, I would recommend this bank.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,2,False
1883,Jessica,12/19/2012,5,"My husband and I both use Bank of America for all of our accounts. While other banks required special documents from him that would have been difficult to obtain in a timely manner (he is originally from Peru), Bank of America welcomed us, stayed with us through the whole application process, and patiently explained all the details. I cannot say enough about the customer service. The application process was also remarkably straightforward – we're a young couple and I was prepared to be intimated by the information forms required. Again though, with the help of customer service, everything was made clear and easy to follow. Regarding problem resolution, we have had two situations arise where we needed assistance: customer service was again swift and accurate in resolving our issues. I am confident that if the bank wants to solve a problem they can do it effectively. The mark down for the problem solving and the clear disclosures is in part because of the fee they will charge (about $7, nominal, but still significant for a couple who doesn't have much) if we want to go in the bank and ask a question. Although I've had a few questions I've avoided going in the bank to ask due to this fee. I've also occasionally found it difficult to determine whether a bill is officially overdue yet or not, and what the repercussions are; when money gets that tight. The last thing I want to do is have the bank asking for another ten dollar bill just to answer a question. Limits on number of withdrawals and overdraft fees have also been slightly frustrating, and were not fully established before we opened the accounts. That said, overall, we are both very pleased with having accounts at Bank of America. I Would definitely recommend it, especially to younger people.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,2,False

I don't ever write checks only use my debit card, and I do everything through the website, the app or at an ATM so I have no need to go into a bank location. I would absolutely recommend this bank to a friend and actually have. One of my friends referred me and I've since brought 2 other friends to the bank and they love it too. The only thing that I would have to say I don't like about the bank is the waiting period for mobile app deposits: it takes 3 days between me taking a picture of a check and it actually being available in my account. Also, I don’t like the hold period when I make a deposit at an ATM (there's the same 3 day period) but at least I get $200 of the check available right away from an ATM.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,2,False

We can transfer money between all of the accounts whenever we want and pay our bills online in just seconds.

It was a pleasant surprise when they offered the online banking option.The only possible complaint I have about the online banking account is that they really discourage coming into the bank. It is worth it, with the cost savings. Their ATM machines are user-friendly, so the average online banking customer will find that it more than suits their needs.The application process online is quick and painless. Unfortunately I went into the bank and had to wait about 20 minutes, with a squirming child, to set-up my bank account. The specialist was polite, as were the rest of the employees.

I chose this bank because I travel a lot and from my research at the time I found that this was supposed to be the most popular bank in America. At first I liked using this bank but I have found that there are not nearly as many Bank of America ATMs and banks as one would think. I often find myself driving a half hour to find one. I would just use another ATM but when depositing checks the only ATM that I can use is one that is part Bank of America’s network and when withdrawing if I use another ATM I get charged five dollars per transaction! Another issue I have had recently is that my debit card got a small scratch on the magnetic strip on the back causing it to not work a lot of the time. As I said I travel a lot and have not been to my home state in about 5 months. I have gone to multiple banking locations and each time attempt to get a temporary card, which I have been told multiple times that they cannot give me because I am not in the state that my account is active in.

As well, when I opened the account, you could withdraw 6 times per month without a penalty, which is now down to just three. On the other hand, this does provided a stronger incentive for me not to touch my savings unless I absolutely have to, so that's something.

After paying for inspection and paying for the appraisal which came out to over a $1000.00. We approached the time to submit my commitment to my attorney. She than stated I needed we had issues with my student loan amount.  So after reaching out to my student loan department, they gave me the documentation to be able to proceed. My attorney than had to submit an extension during this time to allow extra time for Bank of America. At this time I reached out to Joseph Allend, Michelle Brown's supervisor. She had reached him before me and told him of my situation with my student loans. I tried to reach him multiple times via phone and email. Please keep in mind that I moved out of my apartment with my son and had everything placed for the new home.

A great incentive was the $100 cash back for using the card for 3 months and spending at least a combined $500. The money went right into my account at the 3 month mark. I also feel that having your cash backs put into a BoA account is really convenient and the bank gives an extra 10% every time the cash is redeemed and deposited into a BoA checking account. The only draw back is that you have to do it in increments of $25 which is a little high. However, the monthly Bank ""amerideals"" is great as extra cash back ids given if purchases are made at specific vendors. A good aspect of this is that the deals do not have a cap so even if you make a few dollars from the ""Bamk amerideal"" you will get that money in your checking account by the end of the month.

1965,Ashley Bartlett Bustamante,05/30/2012,2,"In the beginning I was happy with this bank. My family used it for years. They were easy to use, didn't charge lots of fees, had many locations, and seemed straightforward. However, they seem to have gotten worse over the years. They began charging fees for moving money from savings to checking, which I found ridiculous. It's my money! I should be able to move it where I want. I also didn't appreciate that they didn't give me any notice when they started charging that extra fee. Instead I had to learn the hard way. They also would unexpectedly lock down my account for times they thought there was suspicious activity. I appreciate them trying to stay on top of things, but it was inconvenient to go to a store and suddenly not be able to use my debit card. None of the times I was locked out were due to actual fraud, so I'm not sure what their system flags as suspicious. I finally had enough when they cashed a check I had written that was over two years old. They shouldn't have cashed it at that point, and this resulted in an overdraft in my bank account along with a fee. I cancelled with them after that, although they still send me junk in the mail. I'm glad I stopped using them when I did, because since then they've added even more ridiculous fees. My recommendation is to look elsewhere!",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,2,False
1966,clinton morais,05/30/2012,4,I have been using BOA for a year now and it has been a very smooth transaction from the credit union I used before. I wanted to switch banks because they were a small local bank that had some good features but they weren't fitting my needs as I moved out of the area to bigger city. I needed to use my bank more often and they just didn't have all the features I needed. I decided on BOA since a friend of mine highly recommended them to me. I opened up a checking/savings account at no cost. I also was able to get my first order of checks for free. I have run into a few problems with my account but they have been resolved as soon as I brought up the issue with them. Their reps have been very helpful and handle themselves very professionally. I have recently been approved for a credit card which will allow me to get rewarded for purchases I make while using the card.

Although I believe the laws have now changed in favor of the customer, at the time it was the law that accounts with debit cards were set by default to allow charges to be accepted at the POS even if the charge resulted in an overdraft, i.e. even if there was not enough money in the account to cover the charge. The customer could request the account to be set so that this did not happen, but the reps never explained this to the customers, and the international customers, who often did not have strong English skills, did not know to ask! I would never have thought to ask this myself. It was rather sickening to me that the reps were told to not tell the customers about this, while they handed out plenty of BofA-branded swag bags, mugs, iPod speakers, pens.

ALL Web based, etc. Works for me! Right? Sort of. BoA has bad reviews all over for the fees they charge, but I ignored them thinking they can't be THAT bad. I admit, I never kept a large balance, if ANY balance in this account, because I simply use my CC for all purchases to get points for travel. Only on the occasion do I use this account for groceries, eating out, etc. Nevertheless, I paid BoA so many ""overdraft fees"" that were suspicious to say the least. For example. I was in Dallas on business, and the night before I came back I saw the low balance of about $59 left in the account, with only 1 bill Pending at the time. I knew I had a check floating out there, so I decided to withdraw funds from my savings, and deposit it the following morning at 7 am. Mind you, I checked the account the previous night while in bed after 10 pm. I went to deposit, and lo and behold, that check written over a month ago was miraculously charged through. NOT PENDING, but cleared entirely. This over drafted my account, and the money I deposited brought it back up to a single dollar. I called and notified them of this, and they stood by their charge of $35 on the account. Sure, I know this is ultimately my fault, however, the timing of things is what is questionable. This is not the only time this happened. I've had several overdrafts because of EXACTLY this same thing. A check is written, and never seems to go through, UNTIL the available balance seems to be lower than what it can cover. Resulting in an overdraft fee. Each time, I have deposited funds to more than cover it, when it was never shown in the account to begin with, but suddenly it clears with no processing time, or nothing. I find that odd, how some checks will process for 2 sometimes 3 days, but only when there are funds to cover it, but when there aren't sufficient funds, they process right away, and are posted as if they were ran through before any other charges were completed.BoA is killing customers with fees, and it is a shame because most would think I can't balance a check book, but the fact remains, I have enough in my savings accounts to live comfortably. I just don't use BoA for that money because their rates are bad, and they aren't anything more than a pay for pizza bank, and in my book, never will be.Save your money, go with a local credit union, and enjoy higher returns on savings.

2014,Deborah O'Neill,06/18/2012,4,"My husband and I have been customers of Bank of America since we moved to North Carolina six years ago. We joined the bank just prior to our physical move and do most of our banking online and when we do need to use the branch, we go to the one on 73 near Northcross. With all the negative press that Bank of America has received in the past few years, we have maintained our loyalty and for good reason. We have our checking account, savings account and our main credit card with BofA.Recently we planned a trip to Ireland and received an unexpected call from the Bank just a week before our departure. The customer representative informed us that someone attempted to use our card in Minnesota (we are in North Carolina) by charging $9.65. This immediately alerted the credit card ""watchers"" who contacted us right away. We were told that this is the way these crooks ""try out"" a card to see if anyone is watching. If nothing happens, the crook then maxes out the credit line before the card is closed. BofA closed our account immediately and then over nighted new cards to us in time for our departure to Ireland. This was outstanding monitoring and service on the part of BofA and we are grateful for this!I love the online services and utilize them every single day from home. We have also been very impressed with the service we receive at the actual bank locations (we have used the one on 73 for the most part, but have also utilized uptown and other branches when necessary).

I just wanted to cash my check with no conflict so I joined. After joining I had to wait a week for them to process my registration that would come with a debit card in the mail. I had no general problems using the service but I wasn't a man with a job so after a couple of months of not putting money into my account, they closed it without ever contacting me or telling me about the closure.

2022,Juan-Pedro Garces-Voisenat,01/03/2020,1,"I started as a Fleet customer back in 2000. It was a great regional bank that was unfortunately absorbed by Bank of America. The level of customer service of BofA got increasingly more deficient with the years, to the point of being reduced to a minimal expression today. The waiting times in their mandatory transaction telephone lines are appalling. Some three years ago, when my checking account balance was more than 50K, due to my level of savings, they practically forced me to change to an interest-bearing account, arguing that I was ""losing money"". On average, they paid me a meagre interest of about 3 cents on 30K. They always addressed me opportunistically as their ""most valued customer"" (no wonder because they profited tremendously from my money balances). In recent months my money balances fell sharply to amounts well below 10K because I became unemployed. Instead of transferring me to my old non-interest-bearing account, they suddenly decided to start charging me a monthly service fee of 25 dollars. It is absolutely ludicrous! They have charged me in one month like 200 times more than all the accumulated interest they gave me. Outraged as I am, I have decided to close my bank account. But it was not enough to go personally to a branch to do the whole operation. They gave me one of their special numbers (which was constantly busy) to do another operation to close my credit card and travel card. I had to find another number online. I called and after waiting for half an hour on the line, the associate asked me how could he provide me an “excellent service”. I stated my purpose and he told me to “call tomorrow” because the people in charge had left for the day. This Texas operator told me that their time was only until 10pm Eastern time.

I always paid ahead on my mortgage.A school board decided to condemn my property. I fought against the condemnation. I decided to pay off my mortgage. When asked for a payoff amount, the the balance was about $8000 high.I went to my branch manager to inquire. After a few weeks, it was determined that the school had made multiple inquiries into the mortgage and the fees for the inquiries had accumulated to approximately $8000. For those who have never had property ""taken"" (condemned) it is an unpleasant experience that has very few rights for you, the condemnee. The School, condemnor, is responsible for paying their fees, by law to keep what happened to me and my family from occurring.Bank of America reassigned the branch manager and informed me that I had to pay off the balance to close the mortgage and I should ask the school to return the funds. They refused to address that their charges were against the law. The school declined to return the funds. I have pursued the matter for years. Though we have repeatedly won court cases, and it was proven the School acted in bad faith, the funds remain tied up in the court cases that are continually extended. I can only hope that my heirs might eventually get the refund.I always fear organizations, like Bank of America, that are willing to impose their burdens, illegally, for their profit, at the cost of their customers and that their customers have to fight for their rights.

2034,Steven Kaiser,07/16/2020,1,"On July 14th 2020, I opened a new checking and savings account with Bank of America using the online method available on their website. I followed all the instructions and answered all questions truthfully. At the conclusion of the process I was asked to wait while my application was being reviewed for approval. Shortly after a message popped up stating that my new accounts were approved. I was provided a link to download their app to my phone. I downloaded the app, opened it on my phone and logged into my new account. As I reviewed the features I learned that I could deposit checks by taking a picture of them. I decided to use this feature to deposit my last two payroll checks. I followed the instructions and successfully deposited both checks. I then wrote “Deposited” on both checks per the instructions from the app. I was informed there was a hold on the checks which I expected but due to the fact these were payroll checks I was not anticipating the hold period would be more than a couple of days. I logged out of my account.Later I logged back into my account and was told that I am locked out of the account and given an 800 number to call. I called the number and was informed I needed to call back during business hours. I made the second phone call on July 15th and after a lengthy wait was told that my account was reviewed by a second person. This person decided to close my new account for suspicion of identity theft, something like that. I was told my only remedy was to go into an actual Bank of America branch and open a new account to replace my closed new account. I asked about how the banks were operating during the virus crisis and only then was I told that I needed to make an appointment first. No appointments were available that day but I was able to schedule one on the 16th at 1:30pm. Because I have a one hour commute to work, I had to miss three hours of work for which I will not get paid. You see, I had been unemployed the previous 6 months. This was my third week on a new job and I had to ask for time off without pay to make this appointment.I arrived at my appointment, explained my situation, she looked at my account and didn’t know what to do. Her supervisor looked at the screen and told her to call the number on it. She called and was put on hold for quite a while, finally spoke to someone that told her they would transfer her call to the correct department, and put her back on hold again. Finally she spoke to someone and when she hung up she told me the following:-	She was going to have to open a new account for me.-	The checks I deposited were going to be held until July 22nd.-	The only way to get the money I deposited into my original new/closed account, transferred to the new account she was going to open today was to make another appointment for the 22nd. At this appointment someone would call this other department and verify that I was at the appointment and then my money would be released into my new account..I explained to the lady helping me about the issue of missing work on a new job plus not getting paid for what I missed. I was told there was nothing she could do, it had to be this way, and asked if I wanted the new account? I told her I need my money and I need an account so reluctantly because I don’t have any choice at this point , yes I want a new account. She starts the process and stops to inform me that there will be a $100 charge to open the new account. I told her that they had enough (all except for the $300 in my wallet) of my money and they weren't getting any more. She went back to her supervisor to see how they could waive the fee only to return and tell me that I had to pay it. That was it for me and I sad no I don’t want an account but I do want my money back. How do I get my money? She said that I would be sent a cashier’s check sometime after July 22nd.All I did was attempt to open a new account, in good faith with Bank of America and in return look at the damages I’ve suffered.-	my payroll income has been taken from me with no definitive answer as to when Bank of America will return my money.-	The new account was going to provide me with the ability to let my employer use direct deposit for my pay. So, even though the first two checks were tied up I would have this week’s pay getting deposited into the account I tried to open. Now, I have to wait until next week to get another check.-	Missed time at work without pay-	I will now have a few bills that will not get paid on time. That means late fees for me strictly because Bank of America took my money.-	Explain this, I was told I had to be at the bank in person on the 22nd to get my money released into a new account. But now, they are just going to send it to me? How does this make any sense at all? It doesn’t, as obviously, in the end, it wasn’t that important after all.-	And finally, the humiliation, lack of respect and absolutely no concern or compassion for me as a human being I was subject to by Bank of America’s treatment is shocking. Not once did anyone enquire about any hardships I might experience as a consequence of their actions. In fact, they wanted another $100, no exceptions, to open an account, which by the way I opened the same account online for free! Through this whole experience I feel the message is clear, “Mr. Kaiser you are a small little insignificant person and we are big, bad, Bank of America. We can do whatever we want to you and there is nothing you can do about it. We stole your money and there is nothing you can do about it. We want more of your money so that you can have the privilege of having an account with us and there is nothing you can do about it.” Well, they were wrong about that because I chose not to give then another $100 and I would never do business with an entity that treats people the way I've been treated.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,3,False

My most recent experience involved the fact that I accidentally downloaded a computer virus, and I was concerned that my online banking information had been compromised. The customer service representative not only assisted in putting a watch on my account, but gave me further steps to ensure that my information was safe. She was 3 steps ahead of me, which truly enhanced my trust with the bank. My only complaint is that a fee exists if you choose to open a second checking account. There are ways around it (elect not to have money directly deposited), but it does seem a bit unfair to charge an already existing customer more money to open a second checking account. Otherwise, their customer service is impeccable and their online banking (and droid app) work wonderfully.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,2,False

They are always friendly, knowledgeable and willing to help with whatever situation I have come up with. Most recently, I went through a divorce and went into the branch to get my name changed on my accounts, checking, savings and a credit card. The woman in the branch office was friendly and was able to get the checking and savings accounts taken care of in just a few minutes, and then she advised me how to go about getting the credit card taken care of, and even suggested a new option on the card for me, one where I end up making cash back for my purchases.I have been a customer of Bank of America for over six years now, and fully intend to be one for a long time to come!",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,female,2,False

The website also seems to include more information about your purchases and programs you have signed up for. Even with programs like Keep The Change, they have told me exactly what goes into savings each time. It's been pretty nice!The one gripe I have is that signing up for a new checking account is supposed to credit you $100 on your signup. I thought I looked over the fine print pretty well at the time, but still somehow missed that you needed to setup a direct deposit with the account in order to get the funds.

So we all have the same last name which happens to be a name from Sicily. Also because we are from Sicily some of our first names might be a little confusing to native English speakers/Americans. We all work and use the same work accounts and constantly transfer money from one work account to another and occasionally to a personal account. The problem is that a few times they have accidentally transferred money to the wrong account. I understand our names are confusing and that its hard to get that type of thing right over the phone but its not cool to try and make a big business purchase and have your check or debit card denied because your bank transferred the money to your brothers personal account instead of to the second work account.

I had autopay set up, as I do with all of my accounts, and it drafted the same, LARGE (over $3000) amount out of my checking account 3 separate occasions. This caused my checking account to be over drafted twice and causing me to incur over draft and line item return charges from my bank (not a Bank of America account). NO ONE was willing to help me resolve this issue that was 0% my or my banks fault. I was finally able to open a case with the dispute team, 2 months later, and after waiting a month for a response was finally told it was my fault that the autopay pulled the amount more than once. I have no idea how they came to that conclusion. I have an excellent credit score with upwards of 13 credit cards, all on autopay, and all paid off every month. I know how things work! I filed an appeal with even more evidence than I sent with the original claim and was told they refused to even review it. I have NEVER had worse customer service in my life. I will NEVER use Bank of America for anything again and plan to tell everyone I know to not use their products. They DO NOT give a hoot about their customers.

I know I am not a big player in the world of finance but I had hoped my loyalty and good standings would have afforded me some sort of respect or preferred status. Apparently BofA simply believes the words 'customer services"" are simply a tag line for promotion only with no intent of achieving a level of success in providing service worthy of someone who chooses to bank with them. My story is simple. I deposited a check valued at over $10K into my checking account on 5/28 and was told ""my"" funds would not be available until 6/9, almost 2 weeks! When I called to complain I was told it was policy to hold larger check for longer periods. To complicate matters, I was heading to the hospital for surgery and was going to need the funds to pay my medical bills. This story only gets worse with my visit to the branch and my visit with an caring Branch Manager and a useless Customer Service Manager.

Therefore, I was unable to access my checking account and I was forced to transfer a big chunk of my money to my other checking in another bank account to utilize it.

A few months after graduation, I was no longer able to keep my student checking account. I was at first annoyed that it seemed I couldn't stay with Bank of America any more if I wanted to avoid paying a monthly maintenance fee, but I was pleasantly surprised to learn about this account option when I met with a banker at my local branch. Since I had plenty of savings already to meet the minimum requirement and a steady job, it was a simple choice to get this account. I went from thinking I was going to have to pay for my formerly free account to actually getting paid (al beit a small amount) for keeping my money with Bank of America. The interest rate is not wonderful, but it's better than the rate I get in my Bank of America linked savings account, and interest rates are pretty terrible at most banks these days.

In order to convince BoA that I was in fact the owner of my own account and did not change my name to transfer all my funds to a bank that didn't exist, I had to do everything short of a DNA test to prove my identity.

I remember when they had the $35 fee that was applied to each transaction that you made when you went over your checking balance which quickly put me into debt for awhile (for a 15-16 year old with no job, it was pretty tough recovering from this) and I resented the institution for a year or two.

I have had a pretty decent experience while banking with them but have also had some pretty upsetting moments.It seems that with Bank of America I have had the most difficult time of any bank discussing over draft charges. They seem to never over turn fees until I get to the point of telling them I am truly unsatisfied with how they are running things, and only then do I need to speak with one person higher up who gives me a very difficult time before over turning anything.I know it is really my fault for over drafting, but there have been occasions where my landlord doesn't cash a check for an extended period of time and finally decides to one day when my funds are low. I just won't have the money in my account until the next day that I am paid which in some instances isn't for a few days. I rack up multiple charges and have to pay back ridiculous fees because my landlord didn't cash a check in a reasonable time frame.

Assuming you travel during a peak time of the year like summer. I est. 121 miles are equal to about $1 spent at Spirit. After the 1st year you would have to charge about $3600 to cover the $59 annual fee. Still not a bad deal if you don't mind dealing with Spirit Airlines and you are willing to make sure you make charges every 90 days or less (to avoid loosing your earned miles). Some points with Spirit airlines.. You can NOT cancel your ticket after 24 hr without paying a huge fine.... Generally about $115 or more dollars.... You have to pay to get an assigned seat. $5 to $15 or you get what you get (not a big deal), You have to pay for baggage... Anything bigger than a purse or small backpack... Don't try to bring you 20"" roll on bag to the gate without paying ahead of time... They'll charge you $100 after they start loading the plane. If your not sure about your bad, ask at the gate attendant before they start loading... Carry on or Check in bags are about $47 +/- a few bucks each way if purchased a head of time. Add it when you purchase your flight. You can print your boarding pass at a kiosk by the baggage check-in or online. Don't do it at the counter or they will charge you. Don't call or they will charge you more, just make the changes online. I est. you can earn something around 1.5% with this card, but you need to make sure Spirit has flights that you would like to take. There are not many places I would fly from this airline. Not sure I would want to take a long fight, but the short ones are alright. I figured I would try the card out for a year and see how it goes. Off season you can fly for much less and you could easily get a round trip or several round trip tickets with the 15000 miles. Good luck and read the fine print on Spirit's website.

This way the customer actually pay for their trip upfront.Secondly the money is supposedly refunded the following business day as their travel reward points are redeemed. This is where the system fails and actually becomes fraudulent!Personally this is our experience: Three months later and many hours spent on the phone, we still had not been reimbursed for the ticket we paid for upfront. in addition, BOA also charged us interest for the trip and it was substantial due to the ticket cost.We had repeatedly called the supervisor at BOA travel reward department who had promised to promptly reimburse us for the ticket we bought with the thousands of travel rewards mileage we had accrued. Three months later, when nothing happened, she stopped taking our phone calls!Yesterday an employee in the business card department found our travel miles unredeemed in our account.

When they're being nice; I have immediate access to all information regarding my account,electronically. All debits and potential debits are listed, immediately. Pendingtransactions are listed and my visible available balance reflects the impending debit.2.) Generally, all checks, personal or business, are added to my available balance upondeposit.

Staff at branches I've visited have almost always been absolutely efficient andhelpful.

They've gone out of the wayto adjust excessive penalties and to assist in international wire transfers (somethingthe US banking system likes to make difficult in most circumstances).My one negative:BOA, like other banks have a nasty practice involving disappearing debits that re-appear in bulk if you make the mistake of keeping less than two hundred dollars in your account for a month. Literally, debits will disappear from your electronic banking statement, and reappear again later. The goal is to trickthe customer into trusting that their available balance is up to date and to overspend, triggering overdraft fees.This practice is currently legal, and, as an aside, it's really up to the customer to keep track of their own spending.

He told me all the ins and outs of my personal loan and answered all my questions clearly. Instead of pressuring me into signing a deal I wasn't prepared for, he told me to take a couple of days to think about it and he would help me whenever I was ready.

I'm really happy with it because I got $100 back when I spent $500 in the first month on a train ticket. And I keep getting money back for regular transactions such as groceries and gas. Also, I get no permanent interest until a full year later, which is great because if I do make a cash advance, I pay low interest until I pay off the full balance amount. Moreover, instead of having to end the card and apply for a new credit card, BoA just adds another full original balance amount to my credit card with no interest on it.

I ended up trying to transfer some money from PayPal into my account and at first it went through from PayPal’s end but then, on Bank of America's part, they told me it was declined, that I couldn’t transfer money from that type of account and so it would be returned. After a week of waiting for my returned money I never got it and so I called their main office and they told me that they decided they could do the transaction after all, but they charged for a transfer fee and an account maintenance fee for two months, even though I had only had my account for only a little over a week. So all the money I transferred got took from them and it was close to 20 bucks.

Also, if you send money across to other countries, like for instance, I send money to my husband's family in Mexico, Bank of America lets you send money freely to their account with little to no fees depending on how much you are sending.

Not only have we found out that they impose a fee you if you don't make deposits every single month, but they also ask you literally 20 different times to verify who you are when you try to make one, single transaction online. Today, for example I tried to extract the excess money that was left over in my account (because we pay a small amount over the monthly mortgage cost each month) and transfer it out of their account and into my main bank account. I was asked for my user id, password, city that I was born, they forced me to regurgitate the security code that they sent to my email, then they made me enter not only the card number on the front of the check card, but the security code on the back, and then after all of this, I ended up having to funnel the money over to my credit card at my other bank through BoA's bill pay option just to get my stinking money back.

2275,robert_banis,03/15/2020,1,"In a nutshell, BofA has become very difficult to work with, non-customer focused and honestly does not exemplify the traditional meaning of a bank. Here are just a few items that all add up to my complete dis-satisfaction:1.)	My family have never been charged for accounts, and now all our checking accounts are being assessed $122.)	As my kids were growing up, they saved coin. We used to make it a learning experience to bring in their bags to the bank and deposit them into their savings accounts. In the beginning, they brought in a bag or jar and branches would dispense in a machine and then deposit. Years later you had to ask for paper rolls, roll it yourself and deposit. Now you make it so difficult with rules your steer customers to grocery stores with machines that take 20-30% commission. I think banks should manage and deal with money of all sorts in my humble opinion.3.)	My son went off to college this year, so we went into our local branch to cash in the savings bonds he had been given every year starting at birth from his grandparents for college. To our dismay, the teller told us that he could only cash a maximum of 5. Really???? These are government instruments! We had to drive around Orange County to 4 different branches to get them cashed for his trip off to TX. Absurd really. Talk about not being customer friendly. Not even the manager is empowered to make logical decisions. I almost closed accounts on the spot.4.)	Stopped in the other day to pick up an extra check register, as they only sent a couple with my last check order. Again – just another thing I could not accomplish while in the branch. They don’t carry them anymore and told me I had to call customer service. Well – that was even more of a frustration as your bank sends you to a 3rd party in India (it sounded like) and they wanted to charge me $2 per blank paper register! It took 45 minutes to get through the right prompts, transfers etc. and actually talk to a person. The prompts all kept wanting to order new checks – nothing for registers.5.)	Your website and mobile app have no way of giving you your current balance. What I mean is that if you pay using bill pay, it does not deduct it immediately from your balance until it processes which is usually at least a week out. So – you have no easy way to know your “real” balance until everything clears – this the reason for check registers. If I had to guess even though software change would make lives easier, BofA looks at bounced check charges as a revenue stream. Why make it simple??6.)	I don’t write that many checks, but recently wrote one to a contractor and he went to my branch on the way home. He had all the proper identification, yet they charged him $8.00 to cash my check, from my branch, at my bank! I think this is ridiculous. They even called me to verify which is fine, but still charged him. I was not happy.There have been long periods where I have had $25k as my standing balance and sometimes much more. Interest paid at your bank is embarrassing. I took my recent company stock cash in of $150K and moved it from your institution to one that paid 2% for their premium savings account. Your loss .

Unfortunately, as someone starting their life after school, sometimes I didn't have the $25 to spare so I would miss a deposit and take the $5 hit. What I didn't know is that when you sign up they can set up the $25 to automatically be transferred from your other account. I hadn't been counting on that so when the transfer went through and took $25 from an account that only had $15 I was hit with a $35 Overdraft plus the $5 fee for not depositing a full $25 a month.

After a long convo she did not offer any help .I explained I am trying to make a good faith payoff to avoid collections and settle the debt. No help was offered at all . No interest deduction no payment plans etc. They said I do not qualify even with an excellent payment record.Other credit card companies have worked with me since this hardship to keep our credit good and offered a pay off Which we paid and made good . We pretty much got the its not our problem reaction. Pretty frustrating and unbelievable .I will continue to pay the minimums i guess.This company is huge and i'm sure the accounts are secured.

Our mortgage was bought out from Country Wide, and had we known this would have happened, we never would have bought the home. During the economic crisis in 07-08, we got a few months behind on our mortgage. We stayed in contact, calling every week. We were told repeatedly that everything was ok, and that the bank had approved an agreement that would allow us to add the payment to the end of the loan. We kept calling, and tried to make payments. The bank REFUSED our payment, (claiming that they couldn't accept anything until the agreement was finalized, but again, telling us not to worry, after all, it was already approved.) About three months later, we received a denial on the agreement, and the banks reason was: (get ready to laugh), we made too much money.

For example, I would be charged extra if I made too many transfers between my accounts (I have a checking and a savings), used a teller for my checking account (but not my savings), and other lengthy-worded consequences.

My main issue was that they wanted to offer me free overdraft protection, to which I said “Sure!” Little did I know they signed me up for a Bank of America credit card I did not ask for with the smallest limit I’ve ever seen, which if I over drafted the balance would be charged to my credit card. As you can imagine, I was very surprised and canceled my accounts with them immediately. While it's partly my fault for assuming that my overdraft would come from my savings account, they also didn't tell me they would be opening a credit card for me.Other than that, the banking and checking were fine just like with any other bank. As long as I maintained a direct deposit checking would remain free, and they offered a comparable interest rate on my savings account. There are always tons of branches, so I had no problem finding one, though overall I’ve found their tellers to be slow in comparison to other banks I’ve been with.If you’re looking for lots of locations for basic savings and checking, the bank is pretty average. It’s possible my customer service issues were isolated to the branch I visited, but that is something to consider as well.",Bank of America Checking,wallethub.com,male,1,False
