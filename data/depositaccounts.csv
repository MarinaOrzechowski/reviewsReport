0, alicefournier,04/24/2020,1,"The Worst Experience I opened a bank account online and I put money on it. 5 days after the account was locked. The bank didn't even notice me of anything. I called BA, a representative told me that I had to go to an agency during the pandemic to show my ID. When I got there a representative told me that my account was actually canceled and they issued me a check with my funds, that I will receive in about 5 business days. It s not what the representative told me on the phone before. I noticed that I also registered '' my new bank account'' to receive the money from the IRS. I said that to the representative at the bank, he really didn't care. He just told me that I could open a new bank account with them and let me understood that otherwise, I could leave right away. As he was impolite and rude, I said no and I left. As a result, all my money was on hold during the pandemic, just when I lost my job. About 6 business days after, the check was not in my mailbox. I called BA, one more time, to talk to a supervisor. I explained to her all the situation, especially that I needed my money asap. She just said '' you have to wait it is our process''. The check will be sent back to us in case there was a problem with the post office. She didn't even say sorry neither tried to find any solutions. She was like a robot reading some lines. I noticed, that I mentioned to all the employees that I lost my job during the pandemic, but it didn't matter to them. Today, I have to wait to receive my money, I can't pay my insurance and my rent this month. I don't even know if I will get my money one day It is the worst experience I ever had with a bank in the US. Usually, representatives are professional and try to find solutions.",,,depositaccounts.com

We paid $900 for an appraisal from BOA and requested they transfer it to Golden One so we would not have to pay for another one. However, BOA refused to do so despite numerous requests, citing regulations. Now we must shell out another $500 for a new appraisal.

4, Mbpacific,11/02/2019,1,"Bank Of America Online Billpay SUCKS On September 30, an online bill pay was scheduled for my daughter’s preschool. Unfortunately, the payment was sent to the wrong address. I contacted Bank of America, and changed the address & asked them to reissue another check. Sadly, the change was never updated and an additional check was issued to another wrong address. After communicating with the preschool, two weeks later, the checks had still not arrived. Another check was issued, this time with the correct address, but it was expected to arrive a month after the payment due date. I requested another check be mailed using overnight service & a refund of a $50 late fee was issued by the bank, since the preschool was no longer patiently waiting for their payment. The check arrived the following day, so I thought my concerns with Bank of America were resolved. Unfortunately, a week later, my online bill pay account experienced some dramatic failures. I have alerts set up on my account, to be sent to the same email address that has been active on my account since I opened it 15 years ago. The alerts are for when money is transferred into my account & when my account is overdrawn. I did not receive any of those alerts to my email. This is the first time this has ever happened. I was charged $70 for overdrawn items. After contacting Bank of America and speaking with two supervisors, they were only willing to refund one overdrawn fee, despite making false statements about the accuracy of my email address and the accuracy of the alerts set up on the accounts. They claimed that alerts that had been set up on my account for many years were not active, despite receiving one through my mobile app the morning of the dispute. I’m concerned that the overall accuracy of my account has been compromised. There unwillingness to refund the charges, when obviously strange and unaccounted for discrepancies happened, is not only disappointing and upsetting, but the lack of accountability from Bank of America is shameful. I was charged late fees for discrepancies solely related to bank errors. They claim that since the bills were paid in full, with no late fees (this time) that they were not willing to issue any further refunds. I have been a customer for 15 years, never had any issues as dramatic and upsetting as this & the lack of customer support is disgusting. I hope my experience can be used as a learning tool for other customers. TAKE YOUR MONEY TO A DIFFERENT BANK!",,,depositaccounts.com

You can call them multiple times and they still won’t release the hold saying it’s a system process they can’t do anything about. Then if in those three days a charge comes through they charge you a NSF charge even though they are holding a $3,000+ check. Awful awful awful customer service. And god forbid you use their app to deposit it. They don’t even give you $200 available that they would give you if you go in to the store. When I called they said they can’t trust the account the check was written from has funds... the account is from a corporation that uses their bank and is a million dollar corporation.....

12, MrDoug85132,02/03/2019,3,"HSA Accounts Two years ago I went into my local BA branch to open a HSA account for my wife. They advertised HSA accounts online but I couldn't accomplish a transaction, so I went to the branch a few miles away where I maintained a corporate account. (THAT's a whole other story of abuse I won't recount here.). At the branch, after staff making a phone call, they told me BA had discontinued opening any new HSA accounts earlier that year. I suggested they delete the HSA service from their advertisements and web site. (To no avail since I note in the summary above they still reference HSA accounts.) I ended up setting her HSA up with an on line account using another bank specializing in HSA accounts. So, their advertising on HSA accounts is false. don't waste your time trying to deal with BA on HSA accounts or any banking issues that are out of the normal daily routine.

14, ACustomerHilton,12/01/2018,1,"Hellish Nightmare. The Absolute Worst! First they were eating up my checking account with fees because I went slightly below $1500 and my ATM card took 3 mo to arrive after I opened the account. So I switched to a Savings account which prevents me from being able to use my debit card for anything other than cash withdrawals. Then my teenaged son was going to Columbia alone and I needed a way to transfer him money so he would to be able to get small amounts of cash out while he was there, so foolishly, we got him two accounts. We spent an hour with a lovely person at the bank, explaining the situation, showing her all our documents, my account etc. I get home to find out that I CANNOT transfer money from my account to his at all. I spend 30 min a day for a week trying to get this sorted out before I have to go to Europe where I won’t have phone or wifi. I spend most of that time in voice-jail because there are no options to speak to a human. All my attempts to transfer get put on some bs fraud-alert hold, even when I do them with BofA staff on the line. Now with hours left before my flight and my teen about to have insufficient travel funds during my absence, I am losing my mind spending 2.5 hours on the phone trying to get something sorted instead of packing. During this same time I had sent a $2000 cheque from another bank and waited 4 weeks for it to get posted! Now they have sent a demand to see his Social Security card again and are threatening to suspend his account if he doesnt find some way receive, sign and return some form in the next six days. They do not seem to comprehend there is no Fedex service in the jungle and they are threatening an 18 year old boy with being unable to eat or even get to the airport to return home by cutting off his funds. BofA is famous for being greedy, fee-gobblers and they along with Wells Fargo are both reputed as the worst among US banks but torturing clients with bureacracy and threatening/stressing out this child is a whole new level of evil. SHAME ON the management and policies. The app would be awesome if it allowed me to actually do a transfer.

We deposited our checks and they are holding a bank check till August 1st when they said we could haev cashed it and had the funds right away vs waiting for the deposit to clear. This was the last straw so we are leaving the bank with our familes...Bank of america lost a lot of money and we have had nothing but troubles with them not keeping track of accounts. We have had several incidents where Money was overdrafted due to processing then fixed and having to fight them for their automated crap. Due to them not giving money on direct deposits from Amazon for a day or so we would wind up missing bills. They would tell us we could do nothing but wait for them to resolve disputed charges where some reason it was rang up twice for food. We would pay a 5 dollar safe checking fee on my account not my husbands to never have to worry about overdrafts and they would still do overdrafts. We called on multiple days, sat with several physical Tellers, managers, and supervisors, and even made them get on a three way merge call with my grandmother's bank for the current check having issues through them which is one of those checks you have to buy with money and is considered cash. It is very dissatisfying that our honeymoon was cut short due to the bank being unjust and not resolving or being able to verify over the phone when they had all these simple solutions they should have been able to do without their clunky software and locks. We did talk to several other banks who said that they can do that since each bank has its own policies but most banks would have had the money resolved since its been technically 4 days now. Due to all these issues we decided to pull our money and go to an alternative bank. Our families are doing the same which means they lost way more money then they anticipated. Please note if these regulations and computer systems they had in place were not 1s and 0s like black vs white answers then it would be a whole lot better but due to them not having one person be able to resolve issues without having to hold stuff forever or take a week to correct what the bank really has due to processing transactions. I swear they only update on a specific few days a week so your checking account is never accurate.On a positive note the application process is not bad and I didn't have much issues when i got my gender change with them changing the info and changing account types. They do try to keep you safe and lock accounts for activity that feels different from what they usually see but its all mostly automated. Sucks when you need to wait an hour for it to unlock again due to the fact that it autolocked from buying from a different store, site, or in a different state than it is usually active.

I've been banking with them since I was 16 and haven't closed my checking account because of comfort and familiarity I suppose. My main complaint with BOA is that a few years ago, I needed a new debit card for my account that I'd had for more than ten years and was told that I had hit a ""lifetime card replacement maximum"" and would need to close the account and open a new one, which is what I did.

It is a simple click of the button. I get alerts when my accounts are low, when my card is used, or when a bill is due. It is so very convenient. The downside to Bank of America is the fees. You must know how much money you need to keep in each type of account, or else you will get fees at the end of the month. Another problem is the low interest rates on the savings account.

This lasted a while and was functional until Bank of America killed it off only keeping it free and without fees with the usual minimum balance of direct deposit. While I was able to avoid fees, its the principle of the matter so for a time I considered Bank of America good but not its becoming more and more greedy.

When opening up a new account, customer service workers were clear, personable and accommodating; the transaction was completed by a representative a matter of a half hour. I also appreciate the convenient online features provided by this bank, such as mobile deposits and electronic money transfers, which have saved me a lot of time (for instance, I pay rent electronically every month directly from my checking account). I've never had a problem with any of these features, which is great. My only complaint is the monthly fee ($12.00, which seems kind of high) and the fees incurred by withdrawals from other banks' ATMs; however, this issue is avoidable most of the time.

In the beginning it was a very good bank but that has changed over the past few years. First they got rid of the drive through windows so you either have to go into the bank or go to the atm machine which is always being worked on. Second they used to have it where if you were having an issue you can go online and speak with a rep but that has also been taken away . I do not know why they did that because it was really convenient. I believe they have let a lot of their staff go because even now when you call you wait at least 30 min to speak to a rep. To me that is very inconvenient and that is why although i have left this account open I now do my majority of banking at a credit union.

 One of the main features I like about Bank of America is their ""Keep the Change"" way to save money. When you purchase something with your debit card, it automatically rounds up to the nearest dollar and moves that small amount of change into your linked savings account. By doing this, I've noticed my savings account grow and don't even realize I'm making deposits. The amount is so small you don't miss it (hence the name ""Keep the Change"". This is a great feature that Bank of America provides.
 Any time I've had to call for customer service, I have gotten nothing but the best US based representatives. They are helpful, knowledgeable and several times have gone above and beyond what I expect from a bank's customer service department. I'm sticking with Bank Of America, you can bank on that!",,,depositaccounts.com

Recently, I discovered that customers can do mobile deposits without a fee! That is so convenient for people like me, who rarely go to ATMs or branches, but get random checks sometimes. I have three children ages 1, 2, and 11 so there is no convenient time for me to go to a bank and I don't want to pay a fee to deposit my own money. Another feature that has been super convenient to my life is that overdraft protection. If I overdraw my account, I have until the close of business to make sure there are funds to cover the balance before I accrue any fees. Sometimes, I get paid the same day there are ACH debits so this satisfies both the bank and the person/institution I'm paying!",,,depositaccounts.com

I've had many other bank accounts in my past and most of them charge me all these fees for things that are irrelevant. At other banks I ended up losing more money than I was putting in. Bank of America's app is also incredibly convenient, the mobile check deposit function is my favorite. It runs so smoothly and never gives me any issues when depositing my checks. The camera is always working well and I am never worried if I won't be able to deposit my check. The balance adjusts when the check clears so I know exactly how much is in my bank account and I don't need to worry if I have enough to clear my bills. Bank of America also has a great function when I can see the routing number and account number so it's easy to attach the account to some of my online bills whereas other accounts I have to search and search for the account number and routing number making it impossible to attach and link the bank account. This website makes everything work so effortlessly. I am even able to download my bank statements on the computer or using my phone.

The woman kept refusing to refund it even though I did not feel the fee was fair. I was transferred to a manager who realized there was a computer error. She fixed my account and refunded me the fee.

You can put a message on facebook and someone will get back to you however it is not a quick thing so if you need a response right away that is not the avenue to take.

I also like the convenience of using multiple screens to conduct your business faster such as paying bills and transferring money from various accounts. It makes paying bills convenient and easy. I also like the fact that their on line banking is very secure and has redundant security checks. They also provide a credit rating score an report for free so you can secure loans easier. You can also apply for loans on line which is nice to have in a pinch. So basically there system is easy to use for non computer skilled people like myself, very secure and also very affordable and with no physical mail to receive from them which I like a lot because there is no clutter at home with all the mailings.

My checking account I have no complaints with, its very simple to use and the fees are non existent as long as you have a direct deposit tied to it. The savings account works well but the interest rate is so low that its almost pointless. Its basically a tenth of a percent which is unheard of nowadays. The money market has a slightly higher interest rate but there is a limit to transfers from the account, only 5 times a month and then you start incurring a fee. I believe I should be allowed to make a few more transfers but overall im ok with this limit. The app works great for bank of america and I dont have any complaints about it.

I am constantly ""in"" my app/online banking website, and there are several features I find excellent. I like the ""keep the change"" feature that transfers any cents on a debit card transaction into my savings account. The pennies do add up, and honestly I don't really miss them leaving my checking account.
Another feature I find OUTSTANDING is the online bill pay. I am able to prepay my bills and schedule when I want the money to come out of my account. It doesn't ""pend"" prior to delivery. I made a HUGE mistake in the joint account at Wells Fargo (that I share with my husband) and prepaid some online bills....scheduling them for three days in advance. By doing this I completely bounced the account! I couldn't believe it. That never happens at BOA, I know what is going out and when the money is coming out.

72, carimay0,08/06/2017,3,"Business with Bank of America I've been banking with Bank of America since I was around 17 years old. At this time they offered a student checking along with a student savings. To preface this, I chose Bank of America because this is where my parents were banking. Upon getting my first job, I opened up the student checking and savings. I learned that for these accounts, there were no monthly charges attached. One didn't have to keep a minimum balance in the account, nor did one have to have direct deposit in order to bypass this. Instead it was pretty simple. Fast forward a few months and a few dollars saved, I wanted to take money from my savings, and transfer to my checking. I learned that there was a certain amount of transfers between my accounts per month, or I'd be charged. At this time it wasn't an issue, as it was supposed to be a one time thing. After a few more months, I wasn't making as much, and was needing to transfer money from my accounts. I quickly surpassed my allowed amount, and began to incur monthly charges. I wasn't very fond of this, and eventually moved myself over to TD Bank. Because this isn't about TD Bank, I'll skip the jargon, and simply state that I wasn't happy with them, and moved back to Bank of America. This time I was not a student, and had to open regular type accounts. At first I didn't open a savings, because I knew the limits behind that. After a while, and seeing that I could successfully save, I opened a savings account, and since, have not had any issues with my banking experience.",,,depositaccounts.com

My goal is to avoid seeing anyone in a bank and I think that is their goal too. Unfortunately, If you have a problem setting up your account you are left to the internet to figure it out because finding a human is next to impossible. So, customer service is pretty much non existant. Their platform is easy enough to use on your mobile phone or computer, I thought it was good and useful. They have all the necessary personal banking products that one would need. The fees bothered me, there are all sorts of penalties if you do not do things correctly, so be careful with fees and make sure you read the fine print in the contract, because they will find a way to hit you with a charge on any misstep, like an overdraw, wire fees etc.",,,depositaccounts.com

80, tashabowen17,05/11/2017,4,"Never had an issue with BOA I've held my checking and savings account for about 5 years now. Initially, I opened the checking at the bank and the savings online, both of which were extremely simple. In the past I have tried other major institutions, all of which have flaws. Bank of America has given me great customer service, fraud protection at its finest, and great app integration. My only complaint is that in 2016 BOA redesigned their app entirely, though functionality was greatly improved, it was tedious to learn again. Despite this, I am very pleased with my bank, they have had my back on many occasions. A couple years back I was grocery shopping, when I went to check out my card was declined, I was shocked because I had just checked my balance before leaving. I paid with a different card and when I finally sat down I opened my app and saw someone was spending thousands. My balance was hundreds of dollars negative. Bank of America noticed that this is not usual for me and subsequently gave me a call. However, I missed this call and prompted the fraud detection in app. It allowed me to submit every fraudulent transaction and receive my money back quickly. I called the bank back after doing this to find out more information because the scariest part was that I had my card in my hand, it was not stolen from me and I did not lose it. So I asked the woman about the transactions and she told me they were local to me. Scary stuff. Anyway, I appreciate the attention to detail as well. Small things like travel notices, locking your card in case of emergency, ordering a new one with the touch of a button, and most of all the budgeting widget they recently released. I would recommend this bank to anyone reading this.",,,depositaccounts.com

I arranged to have one of my utilities deducted automatically from the account. I did not understand fully the overdraft services that Bank of America offers. Several times I have overdrawn due to my funds not being deposited actively til the next day. Every 3 days I found myself getting more into the negative as the overdraft charges occur.

82, dansbooks,05/06/2017,1,"Bank Of America Steals From Dead Clients It's true--Bank of America steals money from the accounts of deceased clients. It is happening to my father's account right now. He passed away some months ago, with about $7,500 in his Bank of America checking account. In January 2017, I filed all required paperwork (I am his son and the executor of the estate) to have the funds disbursed. Bank of American has never responded. On three occasions, I met with bankers at B of A offices in person. All agreed I had done everything required and the funds should have been disbursed to me long ago. They have always been polite...and they have always made it clear that they will do nothing to help me. It seems they are afraid of repercussions to their jobs and careers if they try to have the funds released. I have heard that this is a Bank of America policy. They know it is not worth the cost to me to sue them for $7,500; besides, they can tie it up in court for years (they have a staff of attorneys, so there is no cost to them). Be warned: If a loved one dies, Bank of America will probably attempt to steal the money in their account, as they are doing to me, and there is nothing you can do about it.",,,depositaccounts.com
83, melodiewilkins,05/01/2017,4,"Good customer service and nice checking account offer I decided to get an account with Bank of America because of an advertisement offering free checking. The year was 2012. I was unable to complete the checking account application online, and the application directed me to go to one of the bank locations. Upon arriving, I was told I could indeed get the free checking account with no monthly services fees regardless of the account balance, but that it was conditional. I had to opt into e-statements, with the understanding that if I ever went into the bank to have a teller perform any type of bank service for me, there would be a charge. Since I was having a hard time finding a totally free checking account, and since I like to do many things online anyway, I decided to try it. I was also given access to a free Merrill Lynch brokerage account. I set up the account and have gone in and picked stocks to watch, but have not purchased any. I also tried out a CD account, but soon found out that the interest was so small, it wasn't worth the time. I ended the CD and had to pay a small fee that was larger than the interest earned. That was disappointing, but bad rates on accounts accruing interest were commonplace. It wasn't exactly the banks fault. Overall, I've had a good experience. Once I felt the need to do a chargeback through the bank after a merchant in Shanghai went on Chinese New year after receiving money from me for a purchase. I found out that they were going to be gone for over a month and wouldn't even speak to customers who made orders right before they left. They just left messages. Bank of America reversed the charge in short order. I had plenty of evidence the merchant was ignoring me, and the merchant resolved it on their end and cancelled the order over a month later when they got back, but I am glad Bank of America went ahead and credited the money back to me within 24 hours because it was a large sum. I have had no problems with their customer service.",,,depositaccounts.com

For instance, I called their customer service after finding out that I lost $500.00 out of blue from my checking account. Their personnel responded me by asking a series of question to identify myself related to my personal information. Then, they figured that the their ATM machine in my town got manipulated by someone who put a card reader on top of the their ATM card reader so that they could scan my card information and was able to create a copy of my debit card. They immediately refunded $500 to my account back and started an investigation on this incident.

91, Turveya,01/03/2017,5,"Bank of American Mobile Banking The thing I like about banking with Bank of America is that they have a mobile app available. But this isn't just some crummy app that you don't really use. Instead, I use it for pretty much everything, even making deposits. The app is incredibly easy to navigate which is great because I wouldn't use the app if it weren't. But my favorite thing about it is that I get to deposit my paychecks from pretty much anywhere. I get paper checks from my job, and going to the bank to deposit funds twice a month can be a bit tedious. After all, I don't think anyone enjoys waiting in line at the bank. So when I get a check, I simply log into the app, take a quick photo of each side of the check and choose which account to put it in. The funds are technically added the same business day, though you cannot access them for debit card transactions until the following day. This is especially nice because I have learned that when taking a check into the bank for deposit it takes an extra day for the funds to be added which can be really frustrating. Oh! and did I mention that you can choose to use your fingerprint to login to the account so you don't have to worry about remembering the password? I have at least 50 passwords for various sites so being able to login with the fingerprint is really awesome because it's so easy. I also noticed that earlier this week the app has made it to where you don't have to even login to view your balance. You simply open the app and hit balance. Obviously if you want more information you are going to have to login, but it's nice to be able to access balance information so quickly and easily. I only have a couple small issues with this bank. For one I don't like that every method of depositing money seems to take a different amount of time to post. You depost through the app it posts the same day but isn't available for purchases till the next. You deposit at the atm $300 is available immediately. You deposit with a person at the counter your funds won't post until the following day and won't be available to make purchases until the second day. This can be extremely confusing and it took me at least 6 months before I figured out the various rules. I mean it is my money, so it can get frustrating when you have to wait a day or even two to be able to access that money. My other issue with banking at Bank of America is that the customer service is kind of hit and miss. It seems to be based on who you happen upon. Some customer service reps are great others are awful. In fact when I have had issues with my account I have been known to get one bad customer service rep, hang up and call back, and then get a great customer service rep who is more than happy to help me out. Though even this can be frustrating because once you hang up it take a while of suffering through the automated phone line before you can reach another rep. I will say though, I have had dealing with 3 separate banks and Bank of America is the absolute best.",,,depositaccounts.com

95, JBones,12/11/2016,4,"Bank of America - Accounts review I have been using Bank of America for over ten years now. I have their savings, checking, and credit card accounts. As for the accounts themselves, as long as you do not overdraft, there are little to no fees associated. Transactions are recorded promptly and can be made easy at ATMs, online, or in person at the bank. Interest earned on savings tends to be low. As in all banks, the major drawback in my opinion is having to deal with automated phone services if there is an issue. Eventually you can talk to an assistant, but it takes some tactful maneuvering to do so. In the case an overdraft does occur, you can sometimes explain the reasoning to a bank worker and they will credit you for it. Also, their fraud protection works well if charges are put on your account from a stolen card. Overall, I would recommend the bank, as it is secure and convenient. Just be responsible in your decisions.",,,depositaccounts.com
96, TLaw,12/05/2016,3,"Bank a 'Merica (Go Freedom!) I joined Bank of America in 2015. My old bank, Union Bank of California, closed its branch in my town, and the only other option was BOA. I hadn't heard good things about them. Friends reported that they (BOA) were impersonal, over-corporate, and indifferent in their customer service. Most of that has turned out to be untrue. In fact, their customer service has been unusually friendly, considering how awful customer service can be. I had an issue with mobile banking, for example. The woman I spoke to at the BOA service center (phone service) walked me through the problem patiently, even when I didn't have the right language to explain the problem. She explained that a default setting in my account was causing the app feature to not work (it was more complicated than that, but you get the idea), and was able to correct the snafu lickity-split. Then she asked if I was having a nice day and whether I thought the Broncos were going to win the Super Bowl (it was around Super Bowl time). I'm not a big fan of BOA's online banking system. It's fairly bland, and banking options are sometimes difficult to locate in the drop-down menus. I'm also not too keen on how long it takes transfers, especially international transfers, to clear.

115, goldenlilytraveler,02/09/2016,4,"Solid Bank I have been banking with Bank of America here for 4 years. My review here will be limited to online banking for checking and savings accounts and customer service in branch. I find the online banking interface to be intuitive and reliable. I've not ever experienced a problem and can receive assistance there for just about all my banking needs. I do have one issue with the fees which I find a little high. The free checking is only free if you receive a qualifying direct deposit within the calendar month. If not, the fee is $12 which seems a little steep to me. Also if you for any reason need to actually go into the branch for assistance be prepared to wait a while even if you make an appointment. My experience has been that the customer service staff seem put out to help you in person and expressed politely that what I needed assistance with could have been taken care of through online banking. Obviously this was not the case because if it were I would have done it that way. I found that a little troubling. But overall they have been a decent bank to deal with.",,,depositaccounts.com
116, Jolene Mavis,01/31/2016,1,Deposit Confusion On Saturday at 8:30pm I deposited a check of $200 into my savings account at BOA thru the ATM in my home town. I was told when RE opening my accounts after numerous issues with them from 2012 that $100 clears automatically and the rest would be pending. Fair enough I thought so I made the deposit like my branch teller instructed me to do thru the ATM if it was after business hours. After making the deposit I did a balance in quarry and saw that only $45 was available and the rest was processing. Today (Sunday) I stopped at the ATM to check on what was going on with my account and saw I only had $11.99!! Being the mother of a 9 month old and needing to do shopping I immediately called customer service. At first the women was very confusing and told me 2 diff deposits before she got to the one I had called about and then continued to tell me that of the $200 that $155 was made available to me when it was not. She then had me on hold for over 20 min waiting for a supervisor to give her the ok to credit my account the $$ which I felt was very kind. 10 min later I am told only $50 will be made available and that I would receive the rest on TUESDAY Feb.2nd since they didn't processes checks over the weekend even tho tomorrow is MONDAY and the remaining balance was only $100 if they were crediting my account a measly $50.

117, Dakota,10/22/2015,2,"Think once, think twice, and think again if you find yourself considering putting your money in here Where to begin... I made one of the worst personal finance decisions of my life when I opened an account here at a wistful 19 years old. Poor young me had no idea what he was in for with this fraudulent, selfish, and irresponsible bank. The experience that caused me to finally leave... after the countless fees and random changes in policy that ended up costing me too much money, was my account being hacked after using an ATM outside of one of the banks own locations. ALL of my funds were stolen in this incident, and it took me over a month for Bank of America to accept responsibility and replace the money in my account. And after they finally got around to that, it took another month, 2 months total, for them to issue me a new debit card. If you like writing $5 checks and being hassled trying to withdraw money in person without an active debit card, I would say go for it. Open an account here.

118, BlazeOn,10/03/2015,3,Bank of America Review I think Bank of America is an okay bank you certainly could probably find some better alternatives. From my experience they have a decent team of people at any of the branches I've been to with good experience and a good way of helping their customers. They are always quick and friendly to get you back on your way. The fees are kind of bad I get $12 in maintenance fees taken away every month. The app they have and website works well on a variety of platforms and their apps are always getting updates and have gotten easier to use with more intuitive interfaces. Some of the good features that they have is the ability to cash a check through their atm it is a really painless and simple process and now you can also cash checks from your phone. I think they are competitive and provide comparable services to other banks. Savings and checking accounts are easy to manage. Transfers are generally painless although they do take some time. Using their electronic wire transfers works well and I have never had issue with that or setting up direct deposits.,,,depositaccounts.com

125, mspringfield,06/12/2015,4,"Better Than I Thought... I have 2 bank accounts. 1 with BofA that I opened when I worked for them in 1999 and last year I opened an account with SunTrust thinking that I may eventually change banks (a real pain in the ass because of BillPay/Automatic BillPay.) and move away from BofA all together. I move money back and forth between the accounts as needed... Mostly to SunTrust since my plan was to eventually make them my only bank. Without fail SunTrust will hold my funds for 3 days before I have full access to them, which has caused me so overdraw a couple of times (at a $35 charge from SunTrust), or had online BillPay refused for insufficient funds, causing me more fees and late fees from those I am trying to pay. Yes, I know that banking laws say that it ""could take up to 3 days"" for funds to move between banks. Using electronic transfer I can push money from BofA to SunTrust or can pull from BofA from SunTrust. It doesn't matter which way I do it, SunTrust doesn't make the funds available for 3 days. HOWEVER, BofA shows the funds as gone the day of the transfer. To get around this I have found that I get faster access to my money (or at least part of it) if I actually write a check to myself from BofA and deposit it into SunTrust. Even with that, SunTrust puts a hold on part of my funds, even though BofA has already sent the funds to SunTrust. How do I know? The electronic image of my check is available online at BofA the very next day. If I do the reverse and move money from SunTrust to BofA, SunTrust does not release the funds for 3 days but BofA (after verifying the funds are there) makes the money available to me same day. What do I pay for this wonderful service? At SunTrust - $7.50/month unless I run 10 transactions through the account. At BofA? $0.00 with no stipulations. Totally FREE checking. Comparing the Mobile Banking Apps BofA is great at automatically capturing my check images. Good job there!I used to get really frustrated with BofA but after my experience with SunTrust I will have to say that maybe they are not as bad as I thought. Right now I am going to stick with BofA for the foreseeable future.",,,depositaccounts.com

Similar to the overdrawing from a core checking account, they give you a reasonable amount of time before charging the overdrawn fee. Their rates could be a lot more competitive though. Same with the benefits, the cashback rewards are lackluster. However my experience with customer service has been surprisingly positive for all encounters.

Another $3 to transfer money to MY account at another bank. And my interactions with customer service have been less then acceptable, both within branches and over the phone.

138, Cela28,03/10/2015,1,"Worst Bank Ever This bank is by far the worst big bank I have EVER done business. They are so money hungry they charge you for every little unreasonable thing, and I'm not just talking about OD fees (I opted out of those and use my account wisely). If you are an unhappy customer, they dont care about anything you have to say. They'll just close your account and not even ask why you're unhappy. ONLY ONE EXAMPLE: I had missed two CC payments on ANOTHER CC UNRELATED to BOA (while I made sure to make BOA CC payments on time and more than minimum) and the CC department decided to take the liberty and lower my CC limit based on the two other late payments. WTH??? If I'm current with you and you are getting what is owed to YOU, what difference does it make? When I went in to close both my bank account and my credit card (like I needed the extra ""burden"" of another card) they didn't even bother to ask me why I wanted to close my account to try to keep my business. Maybe had they done so, it would have calmed me down and I would have stayed with them. The fact that they did not do so just goes to show that they have poor customer service and dont care a bit about the customer. My payment history on ALL of my cards, bills and payment schedules are all current, on time and never late, so the ONE time I was having financial problems with ANOTHER institution (nothing to do with BOA) they decided to cut my limit. I have plenty of ""good credit"" cards that I didnt need another one...the only reason I got this one was because it was a promo offer and for a separate business account that I hadn't used for business in awhile anyway, so it's not like it hurt me one bit to close that account. They only stabbed themselves in the foot and now will not see another hard, earned penny of mine go into their institution. My advice? Shop around. There are plenty of other big banks that would love your business and make sure you are happy (within reason) before closing a perfectly fine account.

When I went to him in person he was not helpful either. It felt like he was answering my questions, but really wasn't answering them. However, he did submit the necessary paperwork to Charles Schwab to initiate the transfer. One day I received a call from Charles Schwab that they couldn't accept third party paperwork. So I went to Bank America again to ask for an account number. Luckily, the previous Financial Advisor was moved to a different location. The new advisor was able to answer my questions and give me the information I needed, which was the account number.

The first visit to open the accounts took only about 30 minutes and I was given all the information I needed to make a decision easily regarding the specific type of accounts I wanted to open. The banker answered many questions while entering my information.    The second visit was due to an issue with the email address associated with the accounts which I discovered after registering with the bank's website. The email address needed to be linked to a couple of the new accounts but not to the third. I could not find where this type of change could be made on the bank's website and after calling the bank's support line they directed me to visit the branch once more - so I did.

I am very careful with banking, and have never made any mistakes in 10 years until the online system failed me (seriously, it was not my fault!). I was only credited back $19 out of the $140 charge.

I thought that switching to a local bank would be a big hassle,. I also wondered about having few branches and ATM machines to use.But I was wrong! Moving my online payments and direct deposit was super easy and my local bank's online bill pay is also easy to use. As long as I remind the bank about ATM charges, and don't go over $10 a period, using another bank's ATM is no problem. And my local bank does have a few, so using theirs is an option too!

The main thing I love about Bank of America is how convenient the ATMs are. I have found the ATMs to be located in shopping malls, airports, random street corners, parking lots and various other places. There are quite a few within walking distance of my workplace as well. Their rates have never really been too competitive. The savings account interest rate is pretty much nonexistent. Recently they added a minimum balance of $1500 for my checking account which is very manageable, but I find it annoying to have to constantly keep my eye on it. The few times I have had to step in a branch to do transactions or get service on my account have been very productive.

Their late fees are ridiculous as well, and if you can get to a customer service agent, I don't know why you bothered because they won't help you.

I ended up being overdrawn when I moved all my funds into a different account and a previous purchase went through. I called them after putting the amount needed to cover the fee and purchase back in the account and asked for a one time refund if it was possible.

163, Xander,10/29/2014,2,"Lots of fees Bank of America has many ATMs which is convenient and has local branches available throughout the country which allows me to do banking even when I am travelling. Since I tend to travel quite a bit for work as well as pleasure, access becomes a problem with many of the smaller banks. This is generally not a problem for BoA.  Bank of America charges fees for everything however. If I happen to be somewhere where there is not a local ATM, use of another ATM results in several dollars in fees for each transaction. Credit card fees are high. Overdraft protection is available and you can link a credit card to your checking account to prevent overdraft fees. Unfortunately, if you use the overdraft protection you are charged a significant fee. If there were 2 pending transactions in your account they will transfer money to cover the first and charge a fee then transfer money to cover the second and charge another fee.  They allow mobile deposit now which is a wonderful convenience, but it takes several banking days for funds to be available. Getting an ""acceptable"" picture of a check can be challenging but otherwise the mobile deposit process is easy. Unfortunately funds are delayed in getting to my account. For my last deposit, that meant funds were not available for 6 calendar days and my account was then ""overdrawn"" when my bills were paid despite the fact that I had deposited over $2000. I was then charged overdraft fees for the account and over draft coverage fees for each transaction. This means that near the end of the month when my mortgage is due, I need to drive to the bank to deposit my check instead of using the mobile deposit feature. This defeats the purpose of mobile deposit.  The mobile site and website are fairly user friendly but are down often, especially in the evenings when many people are available to bank. Online bill pay was easy to set up and consistently pays my bills on time.",,,depositaccounts.com

My biggest complaint would have to be the overdraft fees, or rather the fees they charge in general. Seems they try to find any and every reason to try and charge a fee. I cannot count how many times I've gotten charged an overdraft fee for my account overdrafting even if I put money in my account that same day to save my account. According to them one doesn't get charged an overdraft fee until all charges are cleared and not pending anymore but I find that is not the case at all with them. I've put money in my account while charges were still pending and have still been charged fees. I also notice they will charge several overdraft fees back to back for different charges unlike most banks who charge one overdraft fee altogether just for overdrafting period. The only reason I've even been with them so long is because I've grown so used to being with them that I don't want to go through the hassle of switching all of my information over to another bank as far as my direct deposits and bills.",,,depositaccounts.com

I asked them once to put a message on my screen to stop this - didn't work. I won't go near the counter anymore. I'll do my banking by ATM.

Secondly, if I want to change my credit card, etc, I will call or set up an appointment. I find this encounter in such POOR TASTE.

What I couldn't understand were the fees for every minute thing, and most of the fees were ambushes; meaning, you weren't warned before hand by the agents whom displayed such awesome customer service. This is a red flag to me. If you're smiling, I assume that you're trustworthy. But in the end it just seems like they're good at creating friendly environments for profit. There was no other bank that took $8 per month out of my account. This was for ""maintenance fees"" as they say, but I wasn't made aware of this. Then, there was a document that I read that said this fee would be removed whenever there wasn't at least 125 in my account. This wasn't made aware to me. After looking through documents of my own free will, and not after being recommended to do so, i discovered this. The bank has set a fee for just about every service that a you could think of, and in most cases wouldn't be a charge at another bank. My suggestion is go elsewhere if you want a bank that will HOLD your money, and not extort you legally, through contracts and misunderstanding. The banks name should be changed, as it gives the country a bad name.",,,depositaccounts.com

When calling their 800 number I encounter long wait times and I'm often give different answers from each customer service rep when asked the same question. From my experience their customer service reps have been less than friendly and I feel more like a bother than a customer. Overall the technology wins my service since I don't require much personal interaction with Bank of America employees.",,,depositaccounts.com
196, DavidFelton,08/06/2014,5,"Bank of America My first banking experience was and continues to be with Bank of America; I have a student checking account and a savings account with BofA that costs me no monthly fees. Their touch-screen ATM software is awesome, and the machines always read my checks. No matter where I move to in the U.S. there is always a BofA branch/ATM nearby. Their web site is well designed and informative as well. My only complaint are the fees for over-drafts and such, but typically one can resolve their issues with BofA by going in and talking to someone at a branch and explaining the issue.",,,depositaccounts.com

I wanted a private local credit union, but I couldn't get accepted until I had lived here at least three months. So I was off for three months with BoA. At first they seemed okay, but I got monthly fees that I did not like, and they took off some fees for god knows what. Their customer service was okay, but the biggest thing I hated was how they took my money and never mentioned it. You won't earn anything being at this bank, all they will do is rob you blind. Go somewhere else, if you have to bank here, make sure it's for a small amount of time or else they will steal everything you have. Be safe about Bank of America.",,,depositaccounts.com

I ended up learning a lot on how bank works and how you shouldn't just sign up for all their programs. I can't review every single program, but the one I disliked the most was Overdraft protection.

I signed up for a student checking account at that time and had a savings account along with it. A few months into using my account, I had went over the limit on my checking account after buying something at a store. The next day, I found multiple $35 fee charges to my account due to insufficient funds.  On the bright side, I got my first CC from BOA back in December of 2012 with a $300 limit. I had gotten a secured CC as I lacked a credit history and, a year later, I was given the standard card. After calling customer service, I had the card upgraded to their 3-2-1 rewards card and my CL was increased substantially to 2,000.

218, Aaron Jackson,01/02/2014,3,"Average At Best I was forced to open a checking account by a previous employer. He would not deposit my check directly if I banked elsewhere because he would have to pay a fee. That should have told me there all I needed to know about Bank of America, but I acquiesced for his sake. When I quit him, I decided it was easier to keep the account and bank locally. In that time, I watched my account be charged for balance transfers at an exorbitant rate, charged a service fee when I didn't have two direct deposits made in the month that I was transitioning between jobs and other small fees here and there. Additionally, there was never a sense of friendliness or care on behalf of the employees. The convenience factor of the ATMs was the only reason I continued to keep the account, and in time, I decided to just close it all together. Apparently, others did the same because now B of A is no longer even located in that building and I believe no longer in that city except for an ATM. I will never use them again, and I am sure they could care less, but do yourself a favor and use a local bank where they at least feign care because they truly need your business.",,,depositaccounts.com

My gripe is with the mortgage department in some invisible place where you can never speak to the same person twice. This started in July when I received a letter asking for verification of homeowner's insurance. If I had none, they would begin charging me about $2400 for coverage (about triple what I actually do pay) I promptly mailed all the information to the designated location. A month later, I received the same letter. After calling them, they said they never got the information. I then FAXED it to them. A month later, another letter! I gave them my agent's name and number for them to call for the info, which he did. A month later, the same letter! Again a call to another person and again a call to the agent. This week I received a letter telling me when they would start charging my account for the insurance. Aaaarggghhhh! This time I brought the insurance info to my local BOA branch and they FAXED it. I am now awaiting confirmation that they received it and the nightmare ends. Oh, until July when the cycle will start again.At best, they are totally incompetent.

231, vwang,11/27/2012,1,"Greedy Corporate Bank With Poor Customer Service, Focused On Profit Margins Not Their Customers I understand how difficult customer service and banking can be. In my industry, I have lots of experience working with banks and various other service industries. However, I have never, in my life, hung up on any customer service folk. At Bank of America (BofA), I've hung up on 3. Let me summarize my worst 3 experiences with this bank. 1) In 2010, I went to dinner at a Sushi Restaurant. When putting in my tip, the restaurant accidentally inputted too many numbers into the credit card till, and instead of a $45 transaction, my bill was a $45,908.54 transaction. BofA CLEARED this transaction and then spent over a week to reverse the money. At age 23, I did not have anywhere near this amount of money in my account and so I incurred, without doubt, a number of overdraft fees (this was before I finally realized a $45K+ transaction had cleared). Since it took them over a week to reverse the transaction, I was without money for a week. Furthermore, when I had called Customer Service to disput this transaction, the man on the phone asked me if I was trying to buy the restaurant. This was a serious question. Next, instead of reversing all of my overdraft fees, he only reversed half of them. I am not quite sure what his logic was here. 2) Recently, I had to write a few post-dated checks for a house rental. The rental company had deposited them all at once -- something they've done for the past few years. Every other bank would hold onto the checks and deposit the check according to the date listed. BofA cashed all checks immediately, and then started ringing in the overdraft fees. I called them again to disput this. The lady on the phone told me that BofA has no policy to cash checks according to the date listed on the check. In fact, if the check was post dated 6 months (or similarly, 3 years old or dateless), BofA would STILL clear the check. This hardly seems like a good security measure for your bank to have. Let alone a bank as big as BofA. In this instance, while the post-dated check clearing annoyed me, what upset me the most was how the customer service rep handled the issue. In summary, she had basically told me that: this wasn't her problem, it wasn't the bank's problem, and it was my problem to figure out. In fact, I believe she asked me the very question ""well, what do you want me to do? There's no way I'm reversing the overdraft fees and there's nothing else to do."" 3) BofA likes flagging the most random transactions on your account as ""fraud"" and putting a freeze on your account without warning. One or two random freezes without warning, I can understand. The bank is just trying to protect your account and is freezing your card for security measures. However, it gets extremely frustrating and annoying when this happens 4, 5, 6 times... and all, again, without warning. No email or phone call until the next day. By then, you are already aware your account has been freezed, because you were at dinner or out grocery shopping and your card was (embarassingly) declined, and you have no idea why. For these reasons, as soon as I can, I will be switching banks to one that cares about their customers before their shareholders. A company that puts their shareholders and board members before the core of their business (their customers) will, inevitably, fail, and I hope the rest of America will see this soon.",,,depositaccounts.com

234, JLuttrell,09/22/2012,1,"Mortgage Customer Service My sister died in March, 2012.  As a result, she missed her next mortgage payment.  Bank of America called to inquire -- they asked for her, and I told them that she was dead.  Within an hour, they called again.  Despite the fact that I informed them that she had died, they continued to call -- approximately a dozen times.  When I received her death certificate and life insurance proceeds, I went to the local branch and paid off the mortgage.  They accepted the payment.  A few months later, I called the mortgage unit, and I was informed that I do not have authority to receive any information.  I called the enterprise estate unit, and was informed that they had not received the death certificate.  I am trying to retire the mortgage, but I cannot get any information as to why they have not released the lien on the house.  I paid off the mortgage, and submitted the paperwork that they asked for.  The mortgage unit refuses to give me information, but they were certainly willing to accept my money. When I was trying to make funeral arrangements, Bank of America kept calling to ask to speak to the deceased.  They continued to call and ask for her, until they reduced me to tears.  They provoked an angry response after about a dozen calls asking to speak to a dead person.  They simply refused to stop calling for her.  And when I got angry, they told me that my behavior was inappropriate.  The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.  I just want to end this nightmare and terminate any relationship with Bank of America",,,depositaccounts.com

One of the things I like about them is that they allow you to resolve overdrafts within 5 days, before charging you an overdraft fee...or so I thought.   Apparently, they only allow you to do that if you, for instance, went to buy something, didn't have enough funds, and ended up with a negative in your account. If it was an authorized/automatic payment (like a monthly bill, for example), you get charged immediately. Which is fair, but it would've been GREAT if I had known that.

Then, while I was sedated, he drilled 10 of my teeth without even a consultation with me on a treatment plan. When I complained to B of A, they told me that I had to get an expert opinion, which I did. About a week after filing my dispute, I get a call from B of A stating that they can not ask for money back on quality of work rendered in a foreign country. Why didn't they tell me that before I went to the trouble and expense of getting an expert opinion from another dentist? Instead, I receive a letter telling me that after all, merchants have a right to get paid for services rendered. That's like adding insult to injury, which really made me mad. Never mind, that this bank is not there when you need them, but to have the galls to tell me that I should understand that after all, merchants have a right to get paid for services rendered. Are you crazy, not for purposely bilking the client from $130 quote to $570 and not for drilling my teeth without my permission. The worst part is, the fillings were done so poorly that they trap food between my teeth causing more cavities. I initially went there to get an implant, now I need two more. Four of the fillings that Montano put in have already fallen out leaving huge holes, where I use to only have sensitivity. The first implant was charged to my Chase Freedom card. When I told Chase what happened, Chase went into action. They were extremely supportive and even when I was a few days late gathering all the information from the expert witness, within one week of filing my claim, my money including transaction fee was placed back into my account and when the merchant did not respond after two billing cycles, the case was closed with all the money returned to me.

The first time was when the bank erroneously charged me a service fee for three months running that caused an NSF (they had, for three months running told me that the fee would be refunded - it hadn't). The NSF was partly my fault - I had missed accounting for one direct debit. However, instead of charging me an NSF fee for the direct debit, they honored the DD, which hit the account after four small transactions, and hit me with NSF fees on the four smaller transactions. When we questioned this, the customer service rep spoke to us as if we were worthless deadbeats (I hadn't had an NSF in the previous 25 years).  They have just done exactly the same thing again. My bad for the one NSF. Their bad for deliberately turning it into four fees. I've just scheduled all my bills to be paid Monday, and will be closing my account on Tuesday.

We are trying to get a mortgage and have credit scores of over 800, own a home that is paid off, have solid work histories for over 30 years, pay off our credit card in full each month and only have a car payment each month. We've never filed bankruptcy or had a judgment against us. We collect rent on our paid off home and are in the process of buying another home in Florida. We put down 25% as the down payment and the Loan-to-Value ratio is only 75%. But BOA is treating us like we are trying to rob them of the $135K instead of borrowing it.

268, timbucktoo,01/04/2012,1,"Not What A Bank Should Be.... Unfortunately the Bank of America is just another over-sized, uncaring, out-of-touch corporation with little empathy for it's clients.  If you don't believe that then just try to call them on the phone and speak with someone in a timely manner....... it's impossible.  That's the corporate mentality that is so pervasive in the US today.  Gone are the days of the small town banks who actually want and desire to provide a good product.  Welcome the days of the giant corps that have phone trees as long as your arm so that they can avoid personal attention.  Bank of America epitomizes this.  If, after working toward the end of your arm and you still have the patience, and you actually get to speak with a human being be prepared with your second language because the person who answers will undoubtedly be speaking theirs, and it won't be english.  Also, expect them to be sitting at their desk in Pakistan or Mexico because they won't have a clue about your locale and thats the exact approach they will take to solving your problems.  But they will apologize profusely because it says so in the customer relations handbook.  It won't do you any good though because they still won't be able to help you.  So, in conclusion, if this is the type of service you desire then by all means bank with the Bank of America.  If however you actually want to speak with the entity that holds all YOUR money and get answers directly and helpfully, then I strongly suggest you try to find the smallest local credit union you can find and do your business with them.  That's where I'm headed! ........",,,depositaccounts.com

272, Anonymous,12/19/2011,1,"BOA Just Lost A 20 Year Customer! I have been with BOA since 1991--I opened my checking account in college. Over the majority of the years, I've experienced great customer service and highly recommended the bank to others. I have had numerous car loans, equipment loans, as well as unsecured loans. One year, I carried a 20K balance on a BOA credit card. BOA has made tons of money with me as a customer over the years!  Over the past year or so, the culture has changed from great customer service to ""let me squeeze every last dime I can out of my customer."" My first thoughts were--a sign of the times--all banks are struggling. Most recently, I learned that my automatic credit card payments were set up wrong (by me). When the days fell wrong (weekend/holiday), I was unknowingly paying a late fee those months. Looking back, this added up to almost $100 over the past year.  Then, this issue was compounded when I allowed my checking account to go into overdraft one month. I never worried about this, because my credit card provided overdraft protection. All of a sudden, I had several hundred dollars in overdraft fees because the credit card protection was apparently null & void when payment is not received by the due date. (Two day differential in this case.)  I do realize this was all my fault, but BOA of several years ago would have said ""the error was your fault, so we will charge you one instance of overdraft ($30) and credit all the overdraft fees back to you--thank you for being a customer for 20 years."" Now, customer service reps and managers have ZERO AUTHORITY to reverse unreasonable charges (or so I was told).  To the CEO--Was $200 in fees worth losing a 20 year customer? There were times in my life when BOA made well over $200 per month in interest alone from me as a customer.  Over the past month, I've switched all my banking to USAA, who seems to actually want my business. USAA's insurance and brokerage business is top notch, as I have been with them 20+ years too. It's sad to see what was once such a great bank go into the toilet.  Good bye Bank of America! I look forward to trashing your junk mail offering incentives for new customers.",,,depositaccounts.com

Why in the.world they issued an 18 year old with no credit and no job a 2500 limit baffels me to this day, however he made hits payments on time and more than the min balance. We were instructed by the lender to immediately reduce the ammount owed on the card, so we did. Immediately after paying down the card boa dropped his credit limit to 700 (12 more than what we had just paid it down to). This destroyed his credit score and pushed back our home buying process. We had never even received a letter telling us they were dropping it nor did we ever miss a payment or pay late. With a drastic pay increase and better credit then when the card was originally issued the dropping of his credit limit can be seen as nothing more than an attack bc they were not going to get all the intrest.

275, UnhappyBOA,12/07/2011,1,"They Offer Regular Services, But Have Many Fees And Terrible Customer Service I started with Bank of America as a child and kept their services until just after college. I was unhappy with their many fees, but as I always had a steady job, I didn't have too much trouble with this. Besides, I just thought many fees were the norm. However after learning of their many illegal actions and the many cases both private citizens and the US government held against them, and frustrated with the proposed $5 debit card fee, I closed my account and went to a local credit union. After I had closed my account, I had some difficulty because a paycheck was direct deposited to my old, closed account. When I called Bank of America about this, they told me the funds had not been deposited and that they could not hold them for me when they were received. Instead the funds would be sent back to my employer. Working with my HR department, I found out that the funds had actually been deposited and that the customer service representative had simply not taken the time to look it up and lied to me about it. When I called them again, they were unapologetic, refused to help me, would not send the funds to my new account, and were in general rude and unhelpful. This was not the first time a Bank of America employee gave me false information. I was assured by the branch manager that foreign currency exchange services were offered during one visit to a BoA branch.  A few days later I went backt to the same branch at the same time and spoke with the same person to deposit about $20 in Euros into my account.  On this instance though, I was informed that only paper foreign currency was accepted (despite the fact that 1 Euro and 2 Euro are only offered in coin form), and only at certain times during the day.  Thus, they were completely unable to help me with this service.  I would have liked to have been informed of that before I dragged that heavy sack of coins around with me all day.   In short, most of my experience with Bank of America was a case of trusting ignorance. When I learned the truth about their illegal practices and went with a new bank, they were unhelpful and rude to me during the transition.",,,depositaccounts.com

I just completed the loan process with Bank of America and some of the problems I faced were, No communication with me or inability for the loan specialist at Bank Of America to take messages., loan information going to an email address I never provided or used costing valuable time, in other words I never received some very important information, not making the closing date on time, this is one of the most important necessities of a mortgage purchase, this failure on Bank of America’s behalf cost me the seller paid escrow fee of 1500 dollars, the whole process was horrible and this was a little mortgage for under 50K. Bank of America had me down for five and one half percent interest, most lenders are going for four and one half percent or under Its is more involved, what happens after your loan is approved, more than likely there will be more mistakes long term, you may have to deal with, lost payments, Bank of America changing addresses without notification, poor customer communication and many more variables. I pulled out of the loan the same day the documents were ready to sign and close, remember this was after the closing deadline, Bank of America offered me 1000 dollars to change my mine, I explained all the problems I had with this loan and no employee at this branch including the manager seemed to care.. They proved how fast they could work when they were loosing my account by getting the docs in at 9:30pm in order to save the account and make the second deadline.

I had never received anything from BOA informing us that there was a issue of any type with our accounts.  BOA has my email address and they did send plenty of junk emails, they never sent me an alert via my online banking, they never mailed anything to my home, never gave us a call, nothing, nothing at all, they just closed our accounts without any regard on how this would affect us.  As the call progressed the more shocked I became.  I explained to them that we had called them in June due to my husbands debit card not working, and we were told at that time it had been reported lost or stolen, which we hadn't done and as it turns out wasn't the case at all.  Never once did they mention there was a problem with our accounts. I have now discovered that BOA had suspended my husbands debit card at that time so we would call to get the SSN issue corrected.  HELLO, does the right hand know what the left hand is doing, nope not at all, they just mailed my husband a new card and sent us on our way.

As far as I knew I was in the middle of an appeal, and then I started getting letters from attorneys offices telling me I had to vacate the property and appear in court.   7. BofA is the worst bank I've EVER banked with! I will be closing my 2 savings accounts and my credit card through them.   8. My mother in Law works for BofA in the loan modification dept, and told me that they are trained to lie to people. She said it's a Q and A. We ask a question, they find the answer on their paper and tell us. She would tell me exactly what they were going to say, and she was always right! I would call day after day, sometimes 3-5 times a day and they would tell me I haven't called in 2 months! Again...are you freaking kidding me?!?   9. I'm glad to be done with BofA! I'm tired of the heart-ache, crying over this, stressing over it, etc. I've been so depressed for a year now b/c I didn't know what was going to happen next.   10. Go with another bank!! Please!!

306, BOA,05/26/2011,1,"Why I Wish I Never Opened A Bank Of America Account It has been a LONG time since I have gotten this upset. I won't go into details but here's how it breaks down. 1. I've been a customer of BOA since 2003. I have never received any nice perks nor have I ever experienced an extraordinary show of customer service. 2. When I was in middle school, I was set up with a checking and savings account. I was told that if my checking account had an overdraft, my savings account would cover it. Nowhere in my paperwork did it state that there would be a $20 fee. I have still to this date not found this fee in any of their terms and agreements. It's such a stereotype but there really are hidden fees. 3. Their online bill pay is not reliable. People choose to pay online because they trust that BOA will do what they are supposed to do. Instead, canceled payments have still gone through; payments have arrived late; and scheduled payments magically disappear. Their excuse is that I need to print confirmations and hold onto them for 60 days but then again, how is that convenient? 4. This branch's manager assured me that she would reverse my late fee which was as a result of their flawed online bill pay system, let me know that I would get a follow-up call in a few days; and would cancel my pending online bill payments. Instead, the late fee was still there, I never got a call, and the canceled bill payment still went through. 5. Branch managers have more authority than the customer service reps at the 1(800) number. This means that for some issues, you have to go into a branch. How convenient. 6. The customer service reps don't have the slightest clue what customer service means. I get interrupted, transferred to machines where I have to re-state my issue MULTIPLE times; talked back to; told NO NO NO; and lied to. Supposedly they document all phone calls but they don't. You cannot count on all of them to follow through or do what they say; some reps have been good but the negative overshadows those few individuals that try and do a good job. 7. Checking, savings, and CD interest rates are a joke. Do yourself a favor and open a Schwab.",,,depositaccounts.com

The realization that I have little privacy with BoA and their new policy of charging three bucks for ""check imaging"" on the monthly statement is enough to make me investigate other banking opportunities, and to visit my local branch and express my distaste.

The employees at the banking locations are always helpful and kind. On the other hand, if you have to go through the customer service telephone line, those people aren't always as helpful or kind. Bank of America started allowing customers to deposit money in the form of checks or cash into ATMs, which is a good idea and something I was very excited about. I wanted to call to find out more details before I messed something up. When I talked to the customer service on the phone, the lady informed me it was as simple as inserting the check and the funds would be immediately available. That was NOT the correct information as I latter found out. There is a hold on checks that are over $100. Overall, I have had a positive experience with Bank of America.

I worked at a credit union for a year and so I understand the processes and procedures of the banking world. My first negative experience occurred when I had set up an automatic payment from my BOA checking account to my BOA credit card. I had it on auto pay and wanted to change it. So I contaced BOA and they instructed me on how to make the change thru my online banking. I did this. The day of the payment comes and they took it out TWICE, resulting in overdrawing my account. Then for every charge that hit, I incurred another $35 OD fee. I had gotten paid direct deposit that next day at midnight and all my money was absorbed for fees, with no time to work things out. I called the 1-800 number and explained my situation and they COULD NOT care less. They show no customer care. This was THEIR fault and they REFUSED to credit me back my OD fees. I went to my local branch and tried pleading my case with the asst manager who said there had been notes placed on my account not to refund the fees. So I withdrew all my money and closed my credit card. I also deposited a check at the drive thru one day recently and it was drawn on BOA. This was also $100. This should have been immidiately credited to my account. But it was placed on hold. When I saw the hold, I called the 1-800 number and they LITERALLY could NOT tell me why it was on hold. He said it was at the discretion of the teller who took the check. Now I could POSSIBLY see placing it on hold if my account had been negative or it I maybe had less than $100. But I had $3,000 in my savings there!!! Bottom line is they are inconsistent with their policies, only care about upselling you to a freakin money market, CD or savings, and they could care less about customer retention. The ONLY reason I still maintain accounts there is because I do like their online & mobile banking. But I have moved most of my money aay from BofA.

Convenience is the reason I've stayed with them. When I was in school, they had me on a no-fee student account. When I graduated, I kept the account because they didn't (and still do not) charge fees to people with monthly direct deposits. I currently live in NYC and BoA ATMs are everywhere I need them to be.  When I leave NYC two years from now, I look forward to switching to a local credit union or other bank. Below is a summary of my expierience with them. Advantages to BoA:  They have a good website, and their Portfolio funciton works really well. It's powered by the same software that powers Mint.com, so you can see all of your accounts in one place. This is really convenient. ATMs everywhere. Partnerships with overseas banks. When I was in France last summer, I was able to avoid foreign transaction fees by using my BoA card at BNP Paribas ATMs.  They sponsor a promotion where people with BoA cards get free admission to numerous museums, zoos, and aquariums. Disadvantages: Their savings account interest rates and CD rates are lower than elsewhere. I use BoA for day-to-day checking/cash withdrawals, and keep larger amounts in other banks. Many of my friends have had bad experiences with BoA charging unexpected fees. I haven't run into this because I have direct deposit, but the impression I get is that they view the customers as a resource to be exploited, and that it's gotten worse with the passage of credit reform laws. Customer service is not great. When I lost a card, they were quick to answer that. When I've had other, less urgent problems or questions, they put me on hold for lengthy periods of time.",,,depositaccounts.com

We received a folded postcard from BOA notifying us that $38,000 had been withdrawn from our savings account (there was only $13,000 in the account) the notice stated that we should make a deposit within 5 business days of $25,000 to cover the overdraft and we were being charged a $35 overdraft charge. What bank would allow anyone to withdraw $38,000 from an account with total holdings of $13,000? We didn't remove anything from our savings, in fact on the day this withdrawal occurred we actually deposited funds into our savings account. We called BOA Customer Service and were given to the Check Fraud Division where we waited for 5 minutes listening to obnoxious music and while waiting for a rep from the Check Fraud Division. The representative at first said ""this was a banking error"" then she decided it wasn't and would have to be turned over to a fraud analyst.  When we asked when we would have resolution she stated the fraud analyst would call us .  We asked to speak with her manager and were put into a voice mail box and then disconnected.  We called back and got another Check Fraud Dept rep who asked if the  first rep had read us a ""disclosure of our rights"".  The first rep never said that we would be liable for any further withdrawals from the account if we did not freeze the account. We froze the account. We spent the rest of the night on the phone contacting the other financial institutions that we do business with as well as putting a fraud watch on Equifax.  The next morning we went into the BOA Banking Center Manager who said, after a cursory review of our account activity, ""it didn't happen at this bank"" but upon further investigation she determined that it indeed did happen at the local bank.  She said it was a 'keying error"". Apparently a customer came in after us and asked to have $38,000 removed from his savings and he asked for a counter check.  The bank removed $38,000 from our savings and gave him the check.   It appears that the  situation has been resolved (we will believe it when we get a statement showing that our funds have been returned to us and the $35 overdraft charge has been removed).  We firmly believe had we not persisted with the local Bank Manager BOA would never have found their error. When you are afraid that your identity has  been stolen and your accounts compromised it is very frightening indeed. Dealing with BOA Check Fraud Division compounds the fear because it is like falling into a black hole - no customer service, no follow-up, no communication, no help at all. The BOA Check Fraud Division clearly exists to serve BOA not the customer. Needless to say we are closing our accounts with BOA",,,depositaccounts.com
335, BarbaraMcDonald,01/22/2011,1,"Poor Treatment By Bank Of America We have been Bank of America customers for over 30 years.  In 30 years I have never had a check returned NSF until now.  We have two business accounts and a personal account.  I wrote a check from my personal account to my business account and deposited it into the ATM at 8:30 in the morning.  This was all between Bank of America accounts.  Later that day I wrote a check out of the business account to a third party.  Little did I know that for the first time ever in my relationship with Bank of America they had put a hold on the deposit at 1 PM that day even though they knew the funds were there because it came from one B of A account to another.  As a result, the check I wrote to the third party was returned (even though the funds were there) and I was charged $35 for the returned check (even though the funds were there).  I went to the local branch and all I was told was that they had the right to do that and the hold would have been noted on the ATM receipt.  I went home and looked at the receipt and it indicated that the funds were deposited that day with no mention of a hold.  I went back to the branch and spoke to someone else who (while the answer was no different) was at least sympathetic and helpful as opposed to the first person who defiantly stood behind the ""bank rules"" and left us helpless.  Ultimately, I did get the $35 refunded and a letter given to the third party's bank explaining that the situation was a result of an internal matter at B of A and in no way reflected on us or the third party.  I have since talked to other B of A employees and no one can believe that a hold Was placed on a deposit between B of A accounts when the funds were there.  Last week my husband made a deposit to his business account of $20000.  We needed the deposit to post so we could pay payroll taxes.  We were told that $5000 was being held until the next banking day and the balance was being held 10 days.  He also deposited $25000 in checks from Kraft Foods Int'l a nationally known company.  He has been depositing these checks in these figures weekly ever since he  opened the account 4 years earlier.  They also said that they would release only $5000 with the balance to be held for 10 days.  This was the first time they had ever done that even though we had NEVER had a check returned since we opened the account.  Since he needed funds to deposit immediately he asked what he could do to get the funds deposited quicker.  He was told he needed to make a cash deposit although they did not advocate this for safety reasons.  Left with no choice, my husband had to go withdraw money from another bank and walk $20000 cash into the bank which was located in a less than stellar neighborhood.  Ny husband went back five days later to see why they still were holding the funds when they should have been cleared by then.  The telephone agent said that the funds still had not been released by either of the other banks ( Citibank and Chase).  If that were truly the case then why did they release $5000 on each deposit?  We feel we are not being told the truth but you can't talk to anybody with any power and customer service savvy.  When Bank of America was a California company and you could speak with managers in person who had power it was a great bank.  Now, all I want to do is move all of my accounts to a smaller bank of credit union that works with you instead of against you.  ",,,depositaccounts.com

BOA now times your deposits and transfers to show last for the day so that any and all transactions that can drive the balance down will do so and more likely resulting in plenty of $35 fees. Why does our country bail out Banks, Insurance, and Auto companies? They are potentially the most profitable types of business but I guess when your president's campaing funding came from these companies it is obviuos. I hope BOA goes out of business.",,,depositaccounts.com

341, TangoinTacoma,10/10/2010,1,"Bank Of America - More Than Bad Banking...Harassment And Lies!    I was very excited to open my new checking and savings accounts through Bank of America. I had just started a job in Tacoma, wa that used B.O.A. as their bank and if I had an account there I could deposit my checks with no fees. For the first few months, I loved B.O.A. I was young and trying to start financially ""building a life"" for myself so I decided to open a credit card through B.O.A. BAD IDEA!!  I was hoping to build up good credit as I had no credit record at this point in my life.  The account's only fee mentioned was that of a single late fee if the payment was not made on time. This seemed reasonable. Over the next few months, I started to notice charges on my account that were incorrect. Each time I found one, I called B.O.A and, after long debate, they usually corrected these errors. After I charged a hospital bill to my card and the balance was closer to the limit, things got ugly. I always made my payments in full and on time. B.O.A, however, began adding more and more fees for various reasons that had NOT been part of the initial contract. Every time I contacted them, I was given an ear full of stories that NEVER gave any real explanation. If I continued to question them about this they would put me on hold for 20 minutes or longer and then disconnect the line. If this had happened once or twice, I would be willing to assume it was an accident but EVERY time??? Come on, now. I also began noticing false charges to my account supposedly made in places I had never even been. After doing the dance with B.O.A several more times over this, I finally became so fed up that I borrowed the money from a family member and paid off the account. I asked that ALL of my accounts be frozen as I knew no more charges or transactions were due to come through and I would most definitely NOT be banking with Bank of America again. I choze to freeze my accounts because a B.O.A. adviser said it would effect my credit negitively if I just closed the account right away. I confirmed this with other agentcies.  The employee I spoke with argued to the best of her ability but finally gave in, accepted the payment and froze my accounts...OR DID SHE?  Four months later, I recieved a statement in the mail. Everything looked as though no transactions had been made to my checking or savings accounts. Now, might I remind you these statements are ALWAYS seperate from the credit card statement. However, on this statement, in very small print at the bottom was a notice stating that a charge had been made to my credit card and that I had failed to make my payment on time. Funny...my card had been cut up, my checks burned...how is this possible?  I called B.O.A once again for our ritual song and dance of complete disrespect...they informed me that this had been a mistake and that they would ""take care of it right away"". WRONG! EVERY YEAR I do a credit check on my self and EVERY YEAR it shows up that B.O.A closed my account for failure to make payments on time. EVERY YEAR we argue, it gets corrected and we continue on until the next credit check. This year, 2010, I checked my credit and once again my dear friends at B.O.A have reported that my account was closed for failure to pay on time. This year's song and dance lasted for close to an hour with multiple holds and transfers to different departments ending with...care to guess?...a transfer to a closed department that disconnected the line. Thank you, Bank Of America, for the never ending nightmare of harassment and complete disrespect. See you in court.",,,depositaccounts.com
342, Vershelz,09/30/2010,2,"There Were Great Times, There Were Worst Times I have been a long time banker at BOA...very long. I had some great experiences with the bank. There were times when I would overdraft and they would take my overdraft charge away at request. They made my credit card payment easy to pay by lowering my interest rate and allowing small payments to be taken out of my account each month. It wasn't until recently that we had problems. I was given a check for $250. I cashed the check and took out $50. Two days later I get a call from BOA and am told without a reason that I am no longer allowed to bank with them. They kicked me out quicker then hobo in the Trump tower. When I called to find out why they said that my the check I had cashed was from a fake account and that I was putting the bank at risk....!!! So there I was with no source of income since they pretty much told me I would have to wait up to 2 weeks to recieve the money I had in my account. Not to mention it was the end of the month meaning bills had to be paid. After I spoke to about 4 rude customer service reps who told me to just go to another bank and that they were sorry because there was nothing they could do I headed over to Chase. Now I am responsible person and my credit is decent so when I was told that I was not able to join Chase I wanted answers. Turned out BOA blacklisted me. I was and still am not able to join any bank for up to FIVE YEARS!!! I even showed proof to them that the check had no connection to me and it was given to me for graphic work I had done for a client. I made a lawsuite out of it and that is still pending because the client is no where to be found...and I am stuck with this mess. BOA may seem great in their commercials and may offer perks here and there but when I say they will leave you high and dry...I mean seriously they will leave you without care in the world and ruin you while they are at it so you don't want to bank with anyone but them...",,,depositaccounts.com
343, Anonymous,08/30/2010,1,Bank Of America Worst Bank in America! I don't have a good thing to say about this bank. I have tried twice to have an account with them and both times promptly pulled my money out and moved to another bank.  My last move has been to a Credit Union as I don't have all the hidden fees! They lure you in and aren't good about full disclosure of their fees and how much you must keep in the account to not be charged. It took me 3 months then to get an account online unlocked so that I could even remove the remainder of my money. 2 time burned -- NEVER again!,,,depositaccounts.com
344, 51hh,08/21/2010,5,"Bank Of America -- Can Be A Good Bank I have been banking with BofA for many many years, from Baybank to Bank of Boston, then BofA.  I have to admit that, in addition to the amazing numbers of ATMs everywhere, they also offer superb customer service (although I have to say that I am their premier member). The bank is a good bank only when situation arises: Recently I made an error on their BillPay and paid twice (at $2,000) to one of my BofA credit card accounts.  This error, in turn, created insufficient funding in my savings account.  They sent me an e-mail within a day, paid the double amount even though there is insufficint fund in my account, and did not charge me a cent on the overdraft. When I called the BofA credit card department, they initiated an ACH and returned the second (double) payment to my savings account within two business days.And this was just one example of their excellent customer service that I enjoyed over the years!  BTW, I also have their fee-free HELOC (with a huge amount), at a rate of 2.24%. I know that BofA is well-known for their poor customer service and greediness in charging customer fees after fees.  But this customer has been a long-term loyal customer and continue to be one.  So far, I have only good things to say about them. ",,,depositaccounts.com
